# use this to tell which compiler to use
# (in case multiple c or fortran compilers are installed on your system)
# allowed values are:
# for fortran: g95, gfortran, g77, f90, f77, pgf90, pgf77, ifort
# for c: gcc, cc
#preferred_fortran_compiler=g95
preferred_fortran_compiler=gfortran
preferred_c_compiler=gcc

# You could use this to use a gfortran compiler installed in
# a non-standard place. This overrides the preferred setting given above.
# The ld_library_path setting is needed to let the fortran compiler
# run properly without having its libraries in the search path.
# The flags should be setup to allow the fortran code to link with c-code
# (hence the no-second-underscore) and should instruct the compiler
# to generate a shared object file (i.e. PIC)

# Alternatively you could use this to use a g95 compiler installed in
# a non-standard place
#fortran_compiler="/home/jos/bin/g95_32"
#fortran_flags="-fno-second-underscore -fPIC -i4 -r8")

# The c-compiler could be specified manually as well, in case you need it
# (but since I have no alternatives installed for testing I have no
#  examples to give you at the moment)
