    Linear Congruential Random number Generator.

    This is the MINSTD linear congruential random number generator.  Under no
    circumstances should you pick a, m, q, r without doing some serious research
    into random number generation.  You *absolutely must* understand these
    parameters *and* how to choose them.  There are only a handful of known
    good combinations.  If you choose these parameters carelessly, your RNG
    will not work properly.

    There are a few subclasses provided that use known good parameters.

    Note that the seed must be an integer >= 0.  This is different from the
    standard MINSTD generator, which requires an integer > 0.  Lots of users
    seem to like using a seed of zero, so we simply add 1 to the provided
    seed.
