# Resource API

A framework to:
 - declaratively define resources and their relationships
 - handle resource serialization/deserialization to arbitrary data storage (e.g.: MySQL, NoSQL, plain files)
 - expose HTTP interface
 - handle authorization for individual resources

Check documentation for more detailed information.

## Code style

Run [pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) and [pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes) in **src** directory

## Version policy

[Semantic version](http://semver.org/)

## Changelog format

```
VERSION RELEASE-TIMESTAMP=YYYY-MM-DD

    [Author Name <author@email>]
        * CHANGE_TYPE=MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH: change description
```

Example

```
12.11.3 2014-01-12

    [John Smith <john.smith@example.com>]
        * PATCH: refactored the modules
        * MINOR: added a new class
        * MAJOR: removed deprecated function
```

Notes:

- It is a good idea to annotate each commit with PATCH|MINOR|MAJOR message so that it is easier to control the version
  based on the output of `git log` command
- There is no need to modify changelog when documentation or travis related files are updated. Only changes of the
  source code are important.

## Release steps

1. Switch to **master**
2. Merge **dev** into **master**
3. Make sure that all checks and tests pass
4. Increment the version in **CHANGES** file according to the types of changes made since the latest release. Add
   timestamp to indicate that the version was released.
5. Commit the changes
6. Execute "git tag VERSION -m VERSION"
7. Switch to **dev**
8. Merge **master** into **dev**
9. Push **dev** & **master** branches to upstream
10. Push tags to upstream

## Pull requests

Always create your own feature branches from the **dev** branch. Not from **master** one.

1. Make sure that all commits have descriptive messages and are up to the point
2. pep8 and pyflakes checks are supposed to pass
3. All tests are supposed to pass
4. If it is a new feature - make sure that new tests are created and they pass
5. Add a new set of bullet points to the latest changelog entry according to the specified format
6. Create a pull request against the **dev** branch
