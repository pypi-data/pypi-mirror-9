    Represent a MongoDB collection as a Python list of DatabaseObjects.
    
    OBJTYPE is a child class of DatabaseObject; this is the type of object
        to be used in the retrieval of database objects; children
        classes of DatabaseCollection should override this attribute
    
    PATH is the database path in the form "database.collection";
        if not None, this overrides the PATH attribute of OBJTYPE;
        if is None, then the PATH attribute of OBJTYPE is used instead;
        children classes of DatabaseCollection can optionally override this 
        attribute, but defining PATH through OBJTYPE is preferable

    class User(DatabaseObject):
        PATH = "application.users"

        Loads a list of DatabaseObjects from path matching query.  If nothing

        use of the DatabaseCollection class directly.  However, this class is

        OBJTYPE or PATH attribute rather than passing them as parameters here.
        
        WARNING: if you are attempting to grab a particularly large set of
        results (such as an entire collection), your system may run out of
        memory.  In the event of large collections, the number of returned
        results can be reduced either by filtering the results with the query
        parameter or by using pagination via the page_size and page parameters.
        If all you need to do is iterate over the collection, use the `iterator`
        classmethod.
        
        @param path: the path of the database to query, in the form
            "database.colletion"; pass None to use the value of the 
            PATH property of the object or, if that is none, the
            PATH property of OBJTYPE
        @param objtype: the object type to use for these DatabaseObjects;
            pass None to use the OBJTYPE property of the class
        @param query: a dictionary specifying key-value pairs that the result
            must match.  If query is None, use kwargs in it's place
        @param sort_by: a key to use for the sort order of the results; ID_KEY
            by default
        @param ascending: whether to sort the results in ascending order of
            the sort_by key (if True) or descending order (if False)
        @param page: the page number of results to return if pagination is
            being uses; note that if page_size is None, this parameter is
            ignored; page is 0-indexed
        @param page_size: returns only a single page of results, this
            defining the number of results in a page; see also the page
            parameter; if this is None or 0, paging is disabled
        @param read_only: returns the contents as python dictionaries rather than
            DatabaseObjects.  This is not read_only in the sense that the
            returned objects are immutable, but in the sense that they have no
            attached .save() methods, so there is no way to write modifications
            to them back to the database.
        @param field: returns simply the indicated field for each object
            rather than the entire object.  For example, if ID_KEY is passed in
            for this parameter, only the ID's of the collection are returned,
            not the entire contents.  This behaves similarly to read_only
            in that the returned objects cannot be saved to the database if
            they are updated.  Objects that do not have the indicated field
            are omitted from results.
