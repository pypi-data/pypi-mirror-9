Description: Point Tracker
        =============
        
        The point tracker is most useful to compute and show growth and displacement 
        fields on biological tissues. From a series of images of a biological sample 
        over time, the user can select material points over the various images, create 
        cells, and compute the growth rates for each cells over time.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ### From source
        
        You can get the source either by cloning the repository or getting an archive 
        that you uncompress. The application can then be used in-place, or you can 
        install it with:
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        ### Using pip
        
        From pip, you can simply use:
        
            $ pip install point-tracker
        
        
        Launching
        ---------
        
        ### When installed on the system
        
        The setup script will create and install a ``point_tracker`` program on your 
        system, that you simply need to launch:
        
            $ point_tracker
        
        ### From the source folder
        
        From the source folder, you can use one of the tracking script:
        
            $ python tracking.py
        
        Under Linux, you can also use the shell script:
        
            $ ./tracking.sh
