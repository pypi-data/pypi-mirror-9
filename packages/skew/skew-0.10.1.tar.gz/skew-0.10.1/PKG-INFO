Description: skew
        ====
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scopely-devops/skew.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/scopely-devops/skew)
        
        [![Code Health](https://landscape.io/github/scopely-devops/skew/develop/landscape.png)](https://landscape.io/github/scopely-devops/skew/develop)
        
        **Skew** is a package for identifying and enumerating cloud resources.
        The name is a homonym for SKU (Stock Keeping Unit).  Skew allows you to
        define different SKU ``schemes`` which are a particular encoding of a
        SKU.  Skew then allows you to use this scheme pattern and regular expressions
        based on the scheme pattern to identify and enumerate a resource or set
        of resources.
        
        At the moment, the the only available ``scheme`` is the ``ARN`` scheme.
        The ``ARN`` scheme uses the basic structure of
        [Amazon Resource Names](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) (ARNs) to assign a unique identifier to every AWS
        resource.
        
        An example ARN pattern would be:
        
            arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678
        
        This pattern identifies a specific EC2 instance running in the ``us-west-2``
        region under the account ID ``123456789012``.  The account ID is the 12-digit
        unique identifier for a specific AWS account as described
        [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html).
        To allow **skew** to find your account number, you need to add it to your
        botocore/AWSCLI config file.  For example:
        
            [profile prod]
            aws_access_key_id = <my access key>
            aws_secret_access_key = <my secret key>
            region = us-west-2
            account_id = 123456789012
        
        Skew will look through all of the profiles defined in your config file and
        keep track of all of the ones that have an ``account_id`` associated with
        them.
        
        The main purpose of skew is to identify resources or sets of resources 
        across services, regions, and accounts and to quickly and easily return the
        data associated with those resources. For example, if you wanted to return
        the data associated with the example ARN above:
        
            from skew import scan
        
        	arn = scan('arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678')
        	for resource in arn:
        	    print(resource.data)
        
        The call to ``scan`` returns an ARN object which implements the
        [iterator pattern](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types)
        and returns a ``Resource`` object for each AWS resource that matches the
        ARN pattern provided.  The ``Resource`` object contains all of the data
        associated with the AWS resource in dictionary under the ``data`` attribute.
        
        Any of the elements of the ARN can be replaced with a regular expression.
        The simplest regular expression is ``*`` which means all available choices.
        So, for example:
        
            arn = scan('arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:*:instance/*')
        
        would return an iterator for all EC2 instances in the ``us-east-1`` region
        found in all accounts defined in the config file.
        
        To find all DynamoDB tables in all US regions for the account ID 234567890123
        you would use:
        
            arn = scan('arn:aws:dynamodb:us-.*:234567890123:table/*')
        
        CloudWatch Metrics
        ------------------
        
        In addition to making the metadata about a particular AWS resource available
        to you, ``skew`` also tries to make it easy to access the available CloudWatch
        metrics for a given resource.
        
        For example, assume that you had did a ``scan`` on the original ARN above
        and had the resource associated with that instance available as the variable
        ``instance``.  You could do the following:
        
            >>> instance.metric_names
        	['CPUUtilization',
             'NetworkOut',
             'StatusCheckFailed',
             'StatusCheckFailed_System',
             'NetworkIn',
             'DiskWriteOps',
             'DiskReadBytes',
             'DiskReadOps',
             'StatusCheckFailed_Instance',
             'DiskWriteBytes']
        	 >>>
        
        The ``metric_names`` attribute returns the list of available CloudWatch metrics
        for this resource.  The retrieve the metric data for one of these:
        
            >>> instance.get_metric_data('CPUUtilization')
        	[{u'Average': 0.134, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:04:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.066, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:54:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.066, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:09:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.134, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:34:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.066, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:19:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.068, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:44:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.134, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:14:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.066, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:29:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.132, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:59:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.134, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:49:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.134, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:39:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'}]
            >>>
        
        You can also customize the data returned rather than using the default settings:
        
            >>> instance.get_metric_data('CPUUtilization', hours=8, statistics=['Average', 'Minimum', 'Maximum'])
        	[{u'Average': 0.132,
              u'Maximum': 0.33,
              u'Minimum': 0.0,
              u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T10:54:00Z',
              u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.134,
              u'Maximum': 0.34,
              u'Minimum': 0.0,
              u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:04:00Z',
              u'Unit': 'Percent'},
        	  ...,
             {u'Average': 0.066,
              u'Maximum': 0.33,
              u'Minimum': 0.0,
              u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T08:34:00Z',
              u'Unit': 'Percent'},
             {u'Average': 0.134,
              u'Maximum': 0.34,
              u'Minimum': 0.0,
              u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T08:04:00Z',
              u'Unit': 'Percent'}]
            >>>
        
        Filtering Data
        --------------
        
        Each resource that is retrieved is a Python dictionary.  Some of these (e.g.
        an EC2 Instance) can be quite large and complex.  Skew allows you to filter
        the data returned by applying a [jmespath](http://jmespath.org) query to
        the resulting data.  If you aren't familiar with jmespath, check it out.
        Its a very powerful query language for JSON data and has full support in
        Python as well as a number of other languages such as Ruby, PHP, and
        Javascript.  It is also the query language used in the
        [AWSCLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) so if you are familiar with the
        ``--query`` option there, you can use the same thing with skew.
        
        To specify a query to be applied to results of a scan, simply append
        the query to the end of the ARN, separated by a ``|`` (pipe) character.
        For example:
        
            arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678|InstanceType
        
        Would retrieve the data for this particular EC2 instance and would then
        filter the returned data through the (very) simple jmespath query to which
        retrieves the value of the attribute ``InstanceType`` within the data.  The
        filtered data is available as the ``filtered_data`` attribute of the
        Resource object.  The full, unfiltered data is still available as the
        ``data`` attribute.
