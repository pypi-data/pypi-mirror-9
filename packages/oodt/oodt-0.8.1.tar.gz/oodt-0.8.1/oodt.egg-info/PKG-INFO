        Agile OODT is a new version of `Object Oriented Data Technology`_.  It
        improves upon the previous version by being easier to develop, maintain, and
        extend; simpler to integrate by; and faster to use.

        Installation
        ============
        
        What follows are the installation instructions for Agile OODT.
        
        
        Quick Instructions
        ------------------
        
        As a user with administrative privileges, run either::
        
            pip oodt
        
        or::
        
            easy_install oodt
        
        depending on what's available on your system.  You're done!
        
        
        Full Instructions
        -----------------
        
        Agile OODT requires the Python_ programming language.  We recommend version 2.4
        or later.  As of this writing, 2.7 is the latest stable version.  If Python is
        not yet installed on your system, you can find binary and and source
        distributions from the Python website.
        
        To test if a correct version of Python is available on your system, run::
        
            python -V
            
        You should see output similar to::
        
            Python 2.7
            
        indicating the version of Python installed.  You may then proceed to install
        Agile OODT.
        
        By far the easiest, recommended, and encouraged way to install Agile OODT is
        either with Pip_ or EasyInstall_.  If your Python installation has either of
        these installers available to it, then one command is all you need to run in
        order to download, build, install, and generate command-line tools all in one
        go for all users on your system.  For Pip users, it's::
        
            pip oodt
        
        And for EasyInstall users, it's::
        
            easy_install oodt
            
        Be sure to run that command as an administrative user.  For example, on Mac OS
        X and other Unix systems, you might need to run either of::
        
            sudo pip oodt
            sudo easy_install oodt
        
        
        Installing From Source
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If neither Pip nor EasyInstall are available, you can still make a proper
        installation of Agile OODT by building it from its source code.  Just follow
        these instructions:
        
        1.  Download the Agile OODT source distribution and extract the source
            archive.  The source distribution is packaged as a gzip'd tar archive.
        2.  Change the current working directory to the newly extracted directory.
        3.  As an administrative user, run: ``python setup.py install``
