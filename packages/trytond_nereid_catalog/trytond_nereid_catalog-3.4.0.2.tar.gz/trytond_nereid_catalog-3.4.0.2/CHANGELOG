Version 3.2.1.0
===============

* Major Change: Removed product category from being a cataloging system.

  Product category was being used as one of the means to generate a menu
  and catalog hierarchy. Category in Tryton is more of an accounting and
  inventory management system (than a catalog organisation item). Hence
  Product Category functionality that was extended to make it function in
  the web store is removed.

  Alternative: Use nereid-catalog-tree which offers a node object which
  allows products to be classified under multiple nodes.
