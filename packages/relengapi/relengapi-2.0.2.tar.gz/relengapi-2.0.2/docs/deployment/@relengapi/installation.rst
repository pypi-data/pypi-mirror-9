Installation
============

To set up an environment to run RelengAPI (either in production or for development), you will mostly need Python and virtualenv.
However, some of RelengAPI's requirements involve C extensions that in turn require that particular development packages be installed on your host:

 * Python development libraries (Ubuntu: `python-dev`)
 * OpenLDAP development libraries (Ubuntu: `libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev`)
