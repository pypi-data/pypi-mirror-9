relengapi-2.0.0
===============

Breaking Changes
----------------

* The names of the token-related permissions have changed as described below.
  When deploying relengapi-2.0.0, any existing configuration should be updated simultaneously to use the new names.

  * ``base.tokens.issue`` has become ``base.tokens.prm.issue``
  * ``base.tokens.view`` has become ``base.tokens.prm.view``
  * ``base.tokens.revoke`` has become ``base.tokens.prm.revoke``
  
* The ``auth_tokens`` table has acquired three new columns, which should be added to the database before or during the update.

  * ``typ``
  * ``user``
  * ``disabled``

* The ``badpenny_jobs`` table's ``task_id`` column is no longer nullable.

* Previous versions of RelengAPI mistakenly expected a header named ``Authentication`` instead of the standard ``Authorization``.
  In this version of RelengAPI, both are accepted, but clients should switch to use the correct, standard header.
  Support for ``Authentication`` will be dropped in relengapi-3.0.0
