GPG key pair handling
=====================

This module is used to manage GPG key pairs. It allows callers to specify which
GPG key pair and/or key ID they want to use and will automatically generate GPG
key pairs that don't exist yet.

        """
        Initialize a GPG key object in one of several ways:

        1. If `key_id` is specified then the GPG key must have been created
           previously. If `secret_key_file` and `public_key_file` are not
           specified they default to ``~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`` and
           ``~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg``. In this case `key_id` is the only
           required argument.

           The following example assumes that the provided GPG key ID is
           defined in the default keyring of the current user:

           >>> from deb_pkg_tools.gpg import GPGKey
           >>> key = GPGKey(key_id='58B6B02B')
           >>> key.gpg_command
           'gpg --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring /home/peter/.gnupg/secring.gpg --keyring /home/peter/.gnupg/pubring.gpg --recipient 58B6B02B'

        2. If `secret_key_file` and `public_key_file` are specified but the
           files don't exist yet, a GPG key will be generated for you. In this
           case `name` and `description` are required arguments and `key_id`
           must be ``None`` (the default). An example:

           >>> name = 'deb-pkg-tools'
           >>> description = 'Automatic signing key for deb-pkg-tools'
           >>> secret_key_file = '/home/peter/.deb-pkg-tools/automatic-signing-key.sec'
           >>> public_key_file = '/home/peter/.deb-pkg-tools/automatic-signing-key.pub'
           >>> key = GPGKey(name, description, secret_key_file, public_key_file)
           >>> key.gpg_command
           'gpg --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring /home/peter/.deb-pkg-tools/automatic-signing-key.sec --keyring /home/peter/.deb-pkg-tools/automatic-signing-key.pub'

        :param name: The name of the GPG key pair (a string). Used only when
                     the key pair is generated because it doesn't exist yet.
        :param description: The description of the GPG key pair (a string).
                            Used only when the key pair is generated because it
                            doesn't exist yet.
        :param secret_key_file: The absolute pathname of the secret key file (a
                                string). Defaults to ``~/.gnupg/secring.gpg``.
        :param public_key_file: The absolute pathname of the public key file (a
                                string). Defaults to ``~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg``.
        :param key_id: The key ID of an existing key pair to use (a string). If
                       this argument is provided then the key pair's secret and
                       public key files must already exist.

    Force the system to generate entropy based on disk I/O.

    The `deb-pkg-tools` test suite runs on Travis CI which uses virtual
    machines to isolate tests. Because the `deb-pkg-tools` test suite generates
    several GPG keys it risks the chance of getting stuck and being killed
    after 10 minutes of inactivity. This happens because of a lack of entropy
    which is a very common problem in virtualized environments.
    There are tricks to use fake entropy to avoid this problem:

    - The `rng-tools` package/daemon can feed ``/dev/random`` based on
      ``/dev/urandom``. Unfortunately this package doesn't work on Travis CI
      because they use OpenVZ which uses read only ``/dev/random`` devices.

    - GPG version 2 supports the ``--debug-quick-random`` option but I haven't
      investigated how easy it is to switch.

    Instances of this class can be used as a context manager to generate
    endless disk I/O which is one of the few sources of entropy on virtualized
    systems. Entropy generation is enabled when the environment variable
    ``$DPT_FORCE_ENTROPY`` is set to ``yes``, ``true`` or ``1``.
