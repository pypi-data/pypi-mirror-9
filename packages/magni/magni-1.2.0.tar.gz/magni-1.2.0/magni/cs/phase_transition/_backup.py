Module providing backup capabilities for the monte carlo simulations.

The backup stores the simulation results and the simulation timings pointwise
for the points in the delta-rho simulation grid. The set function targets a
specific point while the get function targets the entire grid in order to keep
the overhead low.

Routine listings
----------------
create(path)
    Create the HDF5 backup database with the required arrays.
get(path)
    Return which of the results have been stored.
set(path, ij_tuple, stat_time, stat_dist)
    Store the simulation data of a specified point.

See Also
--------
magni.cs.phase_transition.config : Configuration options.

Notes
-----
In practice, the backup database includes an additional array for tracking for
which points data has been stored. By first storing the data and then modifying
this array, the data is guaranteed to have been stored, when the array is
modified.
