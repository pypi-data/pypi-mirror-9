    Determine the phase transition from the simulation results.

    The simulation results should be present in the HDF5 database specified by
    `path` in the pytables group specified by `label` in an array named 'dist'.
    The determined phase transition is stored in the same HDF5 database, in the
    same pytables group in an array named 'phase_transition'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        The path of the HDF5 database.
    label : str
        The path of the pytables group in the HDF5 database.

    Notes
    -----
    A simulation is considered successful if the simulation result is less than
    10 to the power of -4.

    Estimate the phase transition location for a given delta.
