0.7.1

  * fix django version to 1.6.10 (sync with Telemeta 1.5)
  
0.7

 * Code refactoring:

   - Create a new module `timeside.plugins` and move processors therein: timeside.plugins.decoder,analyzer, timeside.plugins.encoder, timeside.plugins.fx
   - WARNING: to properly manage the namespace packages structure, the TimeSide main module is now `timeside.core` and code should now be initialized with `import timeside.core`.
   - `timeside.plugins` is now a `namespace package <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#namespace-packages>`_ enabling external plugins to be **automatically** plugged into TimeSide (see for example `timeside-diadems <https://github.com/ANR-DIADEMS/timeside-diadems>`_). This now makes TimeSide a **real** plugin host, yeah!
   - A dummy timeside plugin will soon be provided for easy development start.

 * Move all analyzers developped by the partners of the Diadems project to a new repository: `timeside-diadems <https://github.com/ANR-DIADEMS/timeside-diadems>`_
 * Many fixes for a better processing by `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/Parisson/TimeSide>`_
 * Add a dox file to test the docker building continously on `various distributions <https://github.com/Parisson/Docker>`_
