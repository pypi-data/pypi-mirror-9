BayesPy - Bayesian Python
=========================

BayesPy provides tools for Bayesian inference with Python.  The user
constructs a model as a Bayesian network, observes data and runs
posterior inference.  The goal is to provide a tool which is
efficient, flexible and extendable enough for expert use but also
accessible for more casual users.

Currently, only variational Bayesian inference for
conjugate-exponential family (variational message passing) has been
implemented.  Future work includes variational approximations for
other types of distributions and possibly other approximate inference
methods such as expectation propagation, Laplace approximations,
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and other methods. Contributions are
welcome.
