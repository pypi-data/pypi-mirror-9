Description: metaTED is a tool that makes it easy to download all of the `TED talks`_. It
        does so by creating over 1,000 `metalinks`_ of TED talks varying in both the
        quality levels and possible talk groupings by directory. Features include:
        
            * Creates talks with informative file names - i.e.
              ``Unconventional Explanations/Hans Rosling on HIV - New facts and stunning data visuals.mp4``
              instead of original ``HansRosling_2009_480.mp4``.
        
            * Provides subtitles for talks in over 85 supported languages. New
              languages and translations are added daily through the
              `TED Open Translation Project`_, and you help out by
              `becoming a translator today`_.
        
            * Tries hard to get all of the talks, or at least most of them - with a good
              reason if some have failed.
        
            * More choice - creates one metalink per available quality level
              (currently low, standard and high).
        
            * More choice - creates one metalink per available talk grouping, with all
              talks belonging to the same group placed inside a common directory. The
              possible talk groupings are extracted from talks metadata (currently
              filming year, publishing year, event name and author).
        
            * Aggressive caching throughout the project, to avoid expensive network/CPU
              operations as much as possible. Proper cache invalidation included.
        
            * High levels of fault tolerance. 
        
            * Simple, yet powerful homegrown web crawler. 
        
            * Flexible and extensible software design with changes in mind.
        
            * Provides both the console script and a public API.

        Downloading TED talks
        =====================
        
        If you just want to `download TED talks`_, you don't need to install this
        package, or even Python. All you need to do is get a
        `download client that supports the Metalink standard`_ and choose one of the
        `daily updated metalinks`_.
