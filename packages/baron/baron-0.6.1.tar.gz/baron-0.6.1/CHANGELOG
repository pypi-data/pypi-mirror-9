Changelog
=========

0.6.1 (2015-01-31)
------------------

- fix: the string was having a greedy behavior on grouping the string tokens
  surrounding it (for string chains), this ends up creating an inconsistancy in
  the way string was grouped in general
- fix: better number parsing handling, everything isn't fixed yet

0.6 (2014-12-11)
----------------

- FST structure modification: def_argument_tuple is no more and all arguments
  now have a coherent structure:
  * def_argument node name attribute has been renamed to target, like in assign
  * target attribute now points to a dict, not to a string
  * old name -> string are now target -> name_node
  * def_argument_tuple is now a def_argument where target points to a tuple
  * this specific tuple will only has name and comma and tuple members (no more
    def_argument for name)
- new node: long, before int and long where merged but that was causing problems

0.5 (2014-11-10)
----------------

- rename "funcdef" node to "def" node to be way more intuitive.

0.4 (2014-09-29)
----------------

- new rendering type in the nodes_rendering_order dictionary: string. This
  remove an ambiguity where a key could be pointing to a dict or a string, thus
  forcing third party tools to do guessing.

0.3.1 (2014-09-04)
------------------

- setup.py wasn't working if wheel wasn't used because the CHANGELOG file
  wasn't included in the MANIFEST.in

0.3 (2014-08-21)
----------------

- path becomes a simple list and is easier to deal with
- bounding box allows you to know the left most and right most position
  of a node see https://baron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#bounding-box
- redbaron is classified as supporting python3
  https://github.com/Psycojoker/baron/pull/51
- ensure than when a key is a string, it's empty value is an empty string and
  not None to avoid breaking libs that use introspection to guess the type of
  the key
- key renaming in the FST: "delimiteur" -> "delimiter"
- name_as_name and dotted_as_name node don't have the "as" key anymore as it
  was useless (it can be deduce from the state of the "target" key)
- dotted_name node doesn't exist anymore, its existance was unjustified. In
  import, from_import and decorator node, it has been replaced from a key to a
  dict (with only a list inside of it) to a simple list.
- dumps now accept a strict boolean argument to check the validity of the FST
  on dumping, but this isn't that much a public feature and should probably be
  changed of API in the futur
- name_as_name and dotted_as_name empty value for target is now an empty string
  and not None since this is a string type key
- boundingbox now includes the newlines at the end of a node
- all raised exceptions inherit from a common base exception to ease try/catch
  constructions
- Position's left and right functions become properties and thus
  attributes
- Position objects can be compared to other Position objects or any
  iterables
- make_position and make_bounding_box functions are deleted in favor of
  always using the corresponding class' constructor

0.2 (2014-06-11)
----------------

- Baron now provides documentation on https://baron.readthedocs.org
- feature: baron now run in python3 (*but* doesn't implement the full python3
  grammar yet) by Pierre Penninckx https://github.com/ibizaman
- feature: drop the usage of ast.py to find print_function, this allow any
  version of python to parse any other version of python also by Pierre
  Penninckx
- fix: rare bug where a comment end up being confused as an indentation level
- 2 new helpers: show_file and show_node, see https://baron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#show-file
  and https://baron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#show-node
- new dictionary that provides the informations on how to render a FST node:
  nodes_rendering_order see https://baron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#rendering-the-fst
- new utilities to find a node, see https://baron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#locate-a-node
- new generic class that provide templates to work on the FST see
  https://baron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#rendering-the-fst

0.1.3 (2014-04-13)
------------------

- set sugar syntaxic notation wasn't handled by the dumper (apparently no one
  use this on pypi top 100)

0.1.2 (2014-04-08)
------------------

- baron.dumps now accept a single FST node, it was only working with a list of
  FST nodes
- don't add a endl node at the end if not present in the input string
- de-uniformise call_arguments and function_arguments node, this is just
  creating more problems that anything else
- fix https://github.com/Psycojoker/redbaron/issues/4
- fix the fact that baron can't parse "{1,}" (but "{1}" is working)

0.1.1 (2014-03-23)
------------------

- It appears that I don't know how to write MANIFEST.in correctly


0.1 (2014-03-22)
----------------

- Init
