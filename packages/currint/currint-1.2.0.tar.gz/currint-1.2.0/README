Integer based, fixed-precision currency calculation.

A set of helper libraries to do currency calculations using only integers,
and with currency safety (you can't add two different currencies together).

Represents all values as integer amounts in the minor unit (using
ISO 4217 exponent values), and can render numbers to strings or decimals too.
