                \-\-quota|\-q QUOTA[B|KB|MB|GB|TB|PB|EB]
                \-\-cpu_cap|\-c CAP

packages metadata <uuid> get

.TP
packages metadata <uuid> set <key> [\-\-json|\-j|\-\-integer|\-i|
\-\-float|\-f|\-\-string|\-s] <value>
Sets the metadata where
.B <key>
can be a nested period seperated JSON path. If no type is
