Description: ==============
        kotti_calendar
        ==============
        
        This is an extension to the Kotti CMS that allows you to add calendars
        with events to your Kotti site.
        
        It uses the `FullCalendar jQuery plugin`_ to display calendars.
        
        Events can be either pulled from Google calendar XML feeds or added in
        Kotti itself.

        Setup
        =====
        
        To activate the kotti_calendar add-on in your Kotti site, you need to
        add an entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste
        Deploy config.  If you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option,
        add one.  The line in your ``[app:main]`` section could then look
        like this::
        
          kotti.configurators = kotti_calendar.kotti_configure
        
        With this, you'll be able to add calendar and event items in your site.
        
        
        Upcoming events widget
        ----------------------
        
        kotti_calendar provides a upcoming events widget, which is disabled by default.
        To enable the widget add the following to the ``pyramid.includes`` setting::
        
          pyramid.includes = kotti_calendar.widgets.includeme_upcoming_events
        
        With this, the upcoming events will be shown in the right column of the site.
        
        You can adjust how many events will be shown in the widget with set
        ``kotti_calendar.upcoming_events_widget.events_count`` to a different
        value. It defaults to ``5``::
        
            kotti_calendar.upcoming_events_widget.events_count = 10
        
        Upgrading ``kotti_calendar`` in an existing project
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        If you want to upgrade ``kotti_calendar`` in a project where it is already
        installed (and calendars exist in that site), you might need to run a database
        migration::
        
            kotti-migrate <your ini file> upgrade --scripts=kotti_calendar:alembic
        
        E.g.:
        
            kotti-migrate development.ini upgrade --scripts=kotti_calendar:alembic

        ------------------
        
        - Require ``js.fullcalendar>=2.2.5``.
