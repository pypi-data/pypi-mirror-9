Description: pynt-of-django
        ==============
        
        This library provides a set of pre-built tasks for your, pynt based,
        build.py along with supporting utility and project specific functions.

        Install
        -------
        
        -  ``pip install pynt-of-django``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        From within your build.py, setup pyntofdjango.
        
        ::
        
            import os
            import pyntofdjango
            pyntofdjango.setup_pod(os.path.abspath(__file__))
        
        Import any tasks you may need. See `pyntofdjango's
        build.py <https://github.com/WimpyAnalytics/pynt-of-django/blob/master/build.py>`__
        for a full list.
        
        ::
        
            from pyntofdjango.tasks import create_venv, manage, test_nose
        
        Now you should see your new tasks on the command line.
        
        ::
        
            pynt -l
        
        Additional Tools
        ----------------
        
        You are likely to run into cases that the canned tasks don't cover. Or
        maybe they are close but not exactly what you want. For this the lower
        level functions may be useful when building your own pynt tasks.
        
        There is a `project
        module <https://github.com/WimpyAnalytics/pynt-of-django/blob/master/pyntofdjango/project.py>`__
        containing functions specific to your project.
        
        ::
        
            from pyntofdjango import project
        
        As well as a `utils
        module <https://github.com/WimpyAnalytics/pynt-of-django/blob/master/pyntofdjango/utils.py>`__
        containing general utility functions.
        
        ::
        
            from pyntofdjango import utils
        
        About
        -----
        
        This project builds on the `basic way to use
        virtualenv <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#basic-usage>`__,
        where the virtualenv folder (called venv) is placed within the project
        and ignored by the repo.
        
        Why an in-project virtualenv?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The most important bit is that it allows devs to get going with your
        project without worrying about virtualenv all the time. There are more
        reasons and there are disadvantages. `Christopher Webber has an
        explitive filled
        presentation <http://pyvideo.org/video/1870/in-project-virtualenvs>`__
        on some of the reasons in-project virtualenvs may be your style.
        
        Why not use [my favorite build tool]?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `Pynt <https://github.com/rags/pynt>`__ is very simple but nice for that
        same reason.
        
        1. It's pure Python and as a result it works great on all platforms.
        2. It's only a local build tool and not a deployment tool and neither is
           this project.
        3. It supports Python 3 and so does this project.
        4. It makes for a cool companion project name.
