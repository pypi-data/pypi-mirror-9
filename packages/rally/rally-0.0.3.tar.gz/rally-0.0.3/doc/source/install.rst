Installation
============

Automated installation
----------------------

.. code-block:: none

   git clone https://git.openstack.org/stackforge/rally
   ./rally/install_rally.sh

**Notes:** The installation script should be run as root or as a normal user using **sudo**. Rally requires either the Python 2.6 or the Python 2.7 version.


**Alternatively**, you can install Rally in a **virtual environment**:

.. code-block:: none

   git clone https://git.openstack.org/stackforge/rally
   ./rally/install_rally.sh -v


You also have to set up the **Rally database** after the installation is complete:

.. code-block:: none

   rally-manage db recreate


Rally with DevStack all-in-one installation
-------------------------------------------

It is also possible to install Rally with DevStack. First, clone the corresponding repositories:

.. code-block:: none

   git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack
   git clone https://github.com/stackforge/rally

Then, configure DevStack to run Rally:

.. code-block:: none

   cp rally/contrib/devstack/lib/rally devstack/lib/
   cp rally/contrib/devstack/extras.d/70-rally.sh devstack/extras.d/
   cd devstack
   echo "enable_service rally" >> localrc

Finally, run DevStack as usually:

.. code-block:: none

   ./stack.sh


Rally & Docker
--------------

First you need to install docker. Installing docker in ubuntu may be done by following:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install docker.io
    $ sudo usermod -a -G docker `id -u -n` # add yourself to docker group

NOTE: re-login is required to apply users groups changes and actually use docker.

Pull docker image with rally:

.. code-block:: none

   $ docker pull rallyforge/rally

Or you may want to build rally image from source:

.. code-block:: none

    # first cd to rally source root dir
    docker build -t myrally .

Since rally stores local settings in user's home dir and the database in /var/lib/rally/database,
you may want to keep this directories outside of container. This may be done by the following steps:

.. code-block:: none

   cd
   mkdir rally_home
   sudo chown 65500 rally_home
   docker run -t -i -v ~/rally_home:/home/rally rallyforge/rally

You may want to save last command as an alias:

.. code-block:: none

   echo 'alias dock_rally="docker run -t -i -v ~/rally_home:/home/rally rallyforge/rally"' >> ~/.bashrc

After executing ``dock_rally`` alias, or ``docker run`` you got bash running inside container with
rally installed. You may do anytnig with rally, but you need to create db first:

.. code-block:: none

   user@box:~/rally$ dock_rally
   rally@1cc98e0b5941:~$ rally-manage db recreate
   rally@1cc98e0b5941:~$ rally deployment list
   There are no deployments. To create a new deployment, use:
   rally deployment create
   rally@1cc98e0b5941:~$
