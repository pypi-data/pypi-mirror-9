        PO Projects
        ===========
        
        **PO Projects** is a PO file management factory.
        
        Goal
        ****
        
        Have a clean and ergonomic frontend to manage PO files for webapp projects and enable a REST API to deploy PO files into webapp projects.
        
        Features
        ********
        
        * View to create new project from a PO/POT file;
        * View to create new project translation and edit them;
        * View to export project translations as PO files;
        * View to export an archive (zip/tarball) of all translations as PO files (and their compiled MO files) from a project;
        * Manage fuzzy mode, python formatting and plurals for translations;
        * Form to import a catalog file (PO) to update a project's catalog;
        * Nice frontend with Foundation;
        * Permission restriction;
        * Restricted API access with `djangorestframework`_ to get PO files or global project 
          archive from external tools (like `PO-Projects-client`_) ?
        
        Actually there is only support for translation catalogs made for Python apps, with gettext module, Babel or Django.
