        YAML/JSON validation library
        
        This framework is a port with alot added functionality of the java version of the framework kwalify that can be found at: http://www.kuwata-lab.com/kwalify/
        
        The source code can be found at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/kwalify/files/kwalify-java/0.5.1/
        
        The schema this library is base and extended from: http://www.kuwata-lab.com/kwalify/ruby/users-guide.01.html#schema
        
        
        # Installation
        
        Latest stable release from pypi
        
        ```
        $ pip install pykwalify
        ```
        
        or from source
        
        ```
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        
        ## Important notes on version schema changes
        
        After the release of `15.01` the version schema was changed back from the <year>.<month> style version schema back to semantic version names. One big problem with this change is that `pypi` can't handle the change back to semantic names very well and because of this i had to remove the old releases from pypi and replace it with a single version `1.0.1`. 
        
        No matter what version you was using you should consider upgrade to `1.0.1`. The difference between the affected versions is very small and contains mostly bugfixes and added improvments. (See ReleaseNotes.rst for details)
        
        The old releases can still be obtained from `github.com` and if you rellay need the old version you can add the download url to your `requirements.txt` file.
        
        The download links are
        
         - `15.01` - https://github.com/Grokzen/pykwalify/releases/download/15.01/pykwalify-15.01.tar.gz
         - `14.12` - https://github.com/Grokzen/pykwalify/releases/download/14.12/pykwalify-14.12.tar.gz
         - `14.08` - https://github.com/Grokzen/pykwalify/releases/download/14.08/pykwalify-14.08.tar.gz
        
        # Usage
        
        Create a data file. Json and yaml formats are both supported.
        
        ```yaml
        - foo
        - bar
        ```
        
        Create a schema file with validation rules.
        
        ```yaml
        type: seq
        sequence:
          - type: str
        ```
        
        Run validation from cli.
        
        ```bash
        pykwalify --data-file data.yaml --schema-file schema.yaml
        ```
        
        If validation passes then return code from the invocation will be 0. If errors was found then 1.
        
        Run validation from code. Multiple schema files is possible to use when using partial schemas (See doc for details).
        
        ```python
        from pykwalify.core import Core
        c = Core(source_file="data.yaml", schema_files=["schema.yaml"])
        c.validate(raise_exception=True)
        ```
        
        If validation fails then exception will be raised.

        1.0.1
        =====
        
        Switched back to semantic version numbering for this lib. See *README.md* section *Important notes on version schema changes* on how to fix any issues with this change.
        
        15.01
        =====
        
         - Fixed a bug in unique validation for mapping keys [See: PR-12] (Gonditeniz)
        
        14.12
        =====
        
         - Fixed broken regex matching on map keys.
         - Source files with file ending `.yml` can now be loaded
         - Added aliases to some directives to make it easier/faster to write
            * `sequence` --> `seq` 
            * `mapping` --> `map` 
            * `required` --> `req`
            * `regex` --> `re`
         - Reworked all testing files to reduce number of files
        
        14.08
        =====
        
         - First version to be uploaded to pypi
         - Keyword 'range' can now be applied to map & seq types.
         - Added many more test files.
         - Keyword 'length' was removed because 'range' can handle all cases now.
         - Keyword 'range' now correctly checks the internal keys to be integers
         - Major update to testing and increased coverage.
        
        14.06.1
        =======
        
         - New feature "partial schema". Define a small schema with a ID that can be reused at other places in the schema. See readme for details.

         - Cli and Core() now can handle multiple schema files.
         - Directive "pattern" can no longer be used with map to validate all keys against that regex. Use "regex;" inside "mapping:"
         - 'none' can now be used as a type
         - Many more tests added
        
        14.06

         - Cleanup some checks that docopt now handles
         - New keyword "regex;<regex-pattern>" that can be used as a key in map to give more flexibility when validating map keys
         - New keyword "matching-rule" that can be used to control how keys should be matched
         - Added python 3.4 & python 2.7 support (See TravisCI tests for status)
         - Dropped python 3.1 support
         - Alot of refactoring of testing code.
         - Tests should now be runned with "nosetests" and not "python runtests.py"
         - Refactored alot of exceptions to be more specific (SchemaError and RuleError for example) and not a generic Exception
         - Parsed rules is now stored correctly in Core() so it can be tested from the outside
        
        0.1.2
        =====
        
         - Added new and experimental validation rule allowempty. (See README for more info)

        =====
        
         - Reworked the structure of the project to be more clean and easy to find stuff.
         - lib/ folder is now removed and all contents is placed in the root of the project
         - All scripts is now moved to its own folder scripts/ (To use the script during dev the path to the root of the project must be in your python path somehow, recomended is to create a virtualenv and export the correct path when it activates)
         - New make target 'cleanegg'
         - Fixed path bugs in Makefile
         - Fixed path bugs in Manifest
        
        0.1.0
        =====
        
         - Initial stable release of pyKwalify.
         - All functions is not currently implemented but the cli/lib can be used but probably with some bugs.
         - This should be considered a Alpha release used for bug and stable testing and to be based on further new feature requests for the next version.
         - Implemented most validation rules from the original Java version of kwalify. Some is currently not implemented and can be found via [NYI] tag in output, doc & code.
         - Installable via pip (Not the official online pip repo but from the releases folder found in this repo)
         - Supports YAML & JSON files from cli and any dict/list data structure if used in lib mode.
         - Uses pythons internal logging functionality and default logging output can be changed by changing logging.ini (python 3.1.x) or logging.yaml (python 3.2.x) to change the default logging output, or use -v cli input argument to change the logging level. If in lib mode it uses your implemented python std logging.
