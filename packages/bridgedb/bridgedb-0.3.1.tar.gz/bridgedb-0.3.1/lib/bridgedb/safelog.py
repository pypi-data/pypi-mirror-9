"""Filters for log sanitisation.

The ``Safelog*Filter`` classes within this module can be instantiated and
adding to any :class:`logging.Handler`, in order to transparently filter
substrings within log messages which match the given ``pattern``. Matching
substrings may be optionally additionally validated by implementing the
:meth:`~BaseSafelogFilter.doubleCheck` method before they are finally replaced
with the ``replacement`` string. For example::

    >>> import io
    >>> import logging
    >>> from bridgedb import safelog
    >>> handler = logging.StreamHandler(io.BytesIO())
    >>> logger = logging.getLogger()
    >>> logger.addHandler(handler)
    >>> logger.addFilter(safelog.SafelogEmailFilter())
    >>> logger.info("Sent response email to: blackhole@torproject.org")

..

    """Base class for creating log message sanitisation filters.

    A :class:`BaseSafelogFilter` uses a compiled regex :cvar:`pattern` to
    match particular items of data in log messages which should be sanitised
    (if ``SAFELOGGING`` is enabled in :file:`bridgedb.conf`).

    .. note:: The ``pattern`` is used only for string *matching* purposes, and
        *not* for validation. In other words, a ``pattern`` which matches email
        addresses should simply match something which appears to be an email
        address, even though that matching string might not technically be a
        valid email address vis-รก-vis :rfc:`5321`.

    In addition, a ``BaseSafelogFilter`` uses a :cvar:`easyFind`, which is
    simply a string or character to search for before running checking against
    the regular expression, to attempt to avoid regexing *everything* which
    passes through the logger.

    :cvar pattern: A compiled regular expression, whose matches will be
        scrubbed from log messages and replaced with :cvar:`replacement`.
    :cvar easyFind: A simpler string to search for before regex matching.
    :cvar replacement: The string to replace ``pattern`` matches
        with. (default: ``"[scrubbed]"``)

        checking against the regular expression, :cvar:`pattern`.
