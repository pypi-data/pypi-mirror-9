The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (Ohta et al. 2005)
===================================================

The Rossiter McLaughlin (RmcL) effect is an apparent RV shift of the stellar spectrum during
planetary transits. As the planet moves across the stellar disk, it eclipses different fractions of it
with different radial velocities due to stellar rotation. Here, we provide an implementation of the
analytical radial-velocity model presented by *Ohta et al. 2005* [#fOhta]_.
