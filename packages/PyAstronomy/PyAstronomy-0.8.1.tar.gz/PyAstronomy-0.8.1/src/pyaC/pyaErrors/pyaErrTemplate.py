       - `where` - Where did it happen?
       - `why` - Why did it happen?
       - `solution` - string or list of strings, How can the problem be solved?
       - `addInfo` - Whatever additional information may be available.
      
      All parameters are strings of not stated otherwise.
      Of the parameters, only the first (what) and second (errType) are mandatory; the latter
