External fitters
==================

An external fitter is a fitting algorithm not implemented as a part
of funcFit's OneDFit class. Further algorithms can thus be supported,
which may give, e.g., stricter control over individual steps or
internal settings.  
 
A convenient way to pass data to the external fitters is the
"funcFit data set" :doc:`fufDS`.
