A finite state machine maps simple, symbolic inputs to simple, symbolic
outputs.  In this context, symbolic means that nothing differentiates
the values from each other apart from their identity.

The mapping from inputs to outputs also includes definitions for state
transitions.  The current state of the machine changes to a new value
each time an input is mapped to an output (though the new value may be
the same as the old value).
