Miscellaneous scripts
=====================

This directory presently contains miscellaneous scripts that David used to
create datasets and perform his analysis.  Some of them might run
unchanged and perform all necessary steps to create datasets (e.g. the
`master` scripts), others need pre-existing datasets.  Furthermore, now
that David's thesis is done, the framework is in flux again and these
scripts are not necessarily kept up to date.

If you want to see all the original scripts used for David's thesis, check
out revision 'v0.9'.  In later revisions, less interesting scripts have
been pruned.
