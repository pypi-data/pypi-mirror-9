In a TV interview, Mr Sarkozy denied committing any unlawful act.
He said the "grotesque" case against him was designed to humiliate, and harm his reputation.

It is alleged Mr Sarkozy sought insider information from a judge about an inquiry into illegal campaign funding.
Mr Sarkozy was detained on Tuesday for questioning - the first time a former French head of state has been held in police custody.

He is hoping to challenge again for the presidency in 2017 and the allegations are seen as a blow to his hopes of returning to office.
