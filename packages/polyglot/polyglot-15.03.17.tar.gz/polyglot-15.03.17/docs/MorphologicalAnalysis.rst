Morphological Analysis
======================

Polyglot offers trained `morfessor
models <http://www.cis.hut.fi/cis/projects/morpho/>`__ to generate
morphemes from words. The goal of the Morpho project is to develop
unsupervised data-driven methods that discover the regularities behind
word forming in natural languages. In particular, Morpho project is
focussing on the discovery of morphemes, which are the primitive units
of syntax, the smallest individually meaningful elements in the
utterances of a language. Morphemes are important in automatic
generation and recognition of a language, especially in languages in
which words may have many different inflected forms.

Languages Coverage
------------------

Using polyglot vocabulary dictionaries, we trained morfessor models on
the most frequent words 50,000 words of each language.

Example
-------

Word Segmentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from polyglot.text import Text, Word
.. code:: python

    words = ["preprocessing", "processor", "invaluable", "thankful", "crossed"]
    for w in words:
      w = Word(w, language="en")
      print("{:<20}{}".format(w, w.morphemes))

.. parsed-literal::

    preprocessing       ['pre', 'process', 'ing']
    processor           ['process', 'or']
    invaluable          ['in', 'valuable']
    thankful            ['thank', 'ful']
    crossed             ['cross', 'ed']


Sentence Segmentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the text is not tokenized properly, morphological analysis could
offer a smart of way of splitting the text into its original units.
Here, is an example:

.. code:: python

    blob = "Wewillmeettoday."
    text = Text(blob)
    text.language = "en"
.. code:: python

    text.morphemes



.. parsed-literal::

    WordList([u'We', u'will', u'meet', u'to', u'day', u'.'])



Command Line Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    !polyglot --lang en tokenize --input testdata/cricket.txt |  polyglot --lang en morph | tail -n 30
