Named Entity Extraction
=======================

Named entity extraction task aims to extract phrases from plain text
that correpond to entities. Polyglot recognizes 3 categories of
entities:

-  Locations (Tag: ``I-LOC``): cities, countries, regions, continents,
   neighborhoods, administrative divisions ...
-  Organizations (Tag: ``I-ORG``): sports teams, newspapers, banks,
   universities, schools, non-profits, companies, ...
-  Persons (Tag: ``I-PER``): politicians, scientists, artists, atheletes
   ...

Languages Coverage
------------------

The models were trained on datasets extracted automatically from
Wikipedia. Polyglot currently supports 40 major languages.

Example
-------

Entities inside a text object or a sentence are represented as chunks.
Each chunk identifies the start and the end indices of the word
subsequence within the text.

.. code:: python

    from polyglot.text import Text
.. code:: python

    blob = """The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Iran poses a "threat to the entire world"."""
    text = Text(blob)
We can query all entities mentioned in a text.

.. code:: python

    text.entities



.. parsed-literal::

    [I-ORG([u'Israeli']), I-PER([u'Benjamin', u'Netanyahu']), I-LOC([u'Iran'])]



Or, we can query entites per sentence

.. code:: python

    for sent in text.sentences:
      print(sent, "\n")
      for entity in sent.entities:
        print(entity.tag, entity)

.. parsed-literal::

    The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Iran poses a "threat to the entire world". 
    
    I-ORG [u'Israeli']
    I-PER [u'Benjamin', u'Netanyahu']
    I-LOC [u'Iran']


By doing more careful inspection of the second entity
``Benjamin Netanyahu``, we can locate the position of the entity within
the sentence.

.. code:: python

    benjamin = sent.entities[1]
    sent.words[benjamin.start: benjamin.end]



.. parsed-literal::

    WordList([u'Benjamin', u'Netanyahu'])
