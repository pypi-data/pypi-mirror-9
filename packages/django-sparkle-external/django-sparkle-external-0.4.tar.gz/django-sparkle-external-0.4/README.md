# django-sparkle-external

Django-sparkle-external is a spin-off version of django-sparkle-1.5 to provide Sparkle updates with external file sources.

I serve my app site with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), on which it is absolutely painful to enable media file uploads for Django. I changed the file source to a `URLField` so that I can serve my updates with [GitHub](https://github.com) Downloads instead. Some other hooks provided by django-sparkle-1.5 had also been removed since they wonâ€™t work on Heroku.

I also used [Django Ghostdown](https://github.com/uranusjr/django-ghostdown) to provide a better text field for release notes. One benefit (?) of this is that this project does not depend on `Markdown` anymore, but you can use any Markdown rendering library as you wish. See description of Django Ghostdown for more information on the setup.

The original README of django-sparkle-1.5 follows.



# django-sparkle-1.5

Django-sparkle-1.5 is a Django application to make it easy to publish updates for your mac application using [sparkle](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/).

In addition to publishing updates via the appcast feed, Django-sparkle can also collect system profile information if sparkle is configured to report it.

This version of django-sparkle is intended for use with Django 1.5 and has some added features. If you're looking for the base version of django-sparkle, please visit [https://github.com/Mobelux/django-sparkle](https://github.com/Mobelux/django-sparkle)

# Requirements

* Django >= 1.5
* Markdown > 2.1 (for release notes)
* django-absolute (for absolute URLs in the link field of the appcast)

## optional requirements

* OpenSSL (if you want to have releases signed)
This must be available on the command line as the `openssl` command.



# Setup

1. `easy_install django-sparkle-1.5` or `pip install django-sparkle-1.5`
2. Make sure that `django-absolute` is correctly installed (this needs some additional settings).
3. Add `sparkle` to your installed apps
4. In `urls.py` include the sparkle URLs by adding something like `(r'^sparkle/', include('sparkle.urls'))`.
5. Ensure `MEDIA_URL` is correctly set
6. `python manage.py syncdb` to create the tables needed for sparkle.
7. Optional: In `settings.py` add `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` which is the path to your private DSA key for signing your releases.
8. Optional: Add `SPARKLE_UPLOAD_PREFIX` to your settings (default is `sparkle/`). This component will be added to the media URL for your uploaded versions.

# Usage

Create an application and optionally add some versions.

The application's appcast feed will be available at `/whatever_you/configured_in/your_urls_py/(?P<application_slug>\d+)/appcast.xml`.

Your uploaded versions will be available at `{{ MEDIA_URL }}/SPARKLE_UPLOAD_PREFIX/application_slug/version_number.extension`. You can get the URL for an latest version of an Application by calling `instance.latest().update.url`.

Set the `SUFeedURL` key in your Info.plist to point to the sparkle application's appcast URL. `http://example.com/sparkle/app/appcast.xml` for example.

If you want to enable system profiling, be sure to set the `SUEnableSystemProfiling` key in your Info.plist to `YES`.

# Settings

* `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`
   The path to your DSA private key for signing releases.  Defaults to `None`.  If not provided, releases will not be automatically signed when uploaded.
* `SPARKLE_UPLOAD_PREFIX`
The path prefix that will be added to your uploaded files. Defaults to `sparkle/`. Use this to configure the upload directory in which your release files will end. Note that this prefix will become part of the download URL. Remember to end this with a `/` if you want a directory.


# To Do

* Tests of course!
