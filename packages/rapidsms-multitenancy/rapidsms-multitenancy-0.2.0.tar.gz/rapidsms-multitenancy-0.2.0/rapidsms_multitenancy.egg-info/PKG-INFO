        Description
        -----------
        
        Why would you want to use rapidsms-multitenancy? It was built for a situation where a large
        organization has operations in multiple countries. It's desirable for each country to have its own
        RapidSMS instance so that users can easily communicate with that local backend. On the other hand,
        it's a pain to install RapidSMS in each location as you'd have to do each installation separately,
        keep each installation updated, and have user accounts duplicated over installations.
        
        rapidsms-multitenancy allows you to have one central RapidSMS installation with multiple tenants.
        Each tenant is associated with one RapidSMS backend with the aim of keeping each tenant
        separate. Superusers of the system can view multiple tenants.
