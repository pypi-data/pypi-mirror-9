Summary
-------

This cube provides a code review system on top of the `vcsfile cube`_. It has
been developed with the workflow we use at Logilab in mind, based on
`mercurial`_ and its `evolve`_ extension.

More information in the wdoc/ subdirectory, which is integrated in the web ui
when the cube is installed (see <your instance url>/doc/main).

You may be interested in the `trackervcs`_ which integrates `vcsfile`_
and `vcreview`_ cubes into the `tracker cube`_, allowing to link
projects to their repository, tickets to patches and revisions, etc...
