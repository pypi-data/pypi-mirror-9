        EEA Sparql is a plone product for fetching data from Linked open data servers
        (sparql endpoints).
        
        
        .. contents::
        
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        It is simple to use, you only have to specify the sparql endpoint url and the
        sparql query.
        The results will be converted in an exhibit json, what can easily be reused
        (ex. by eea.daviz).
        
        
        Main features
        =============
        
        The main features are:
        
        1. create sparql queries
        2. create sparql bookmark folders, sparql queries are created automatically,
           and can be synchronized manually or automatically (with a cronjob).
           If a query is changed, a new version of the object is created,
           so older ones are not lost.
        3. results are downloadable in various formats:
           JSON, Exhibit JSON, HTML, XML, XML with Schema, CSV, TSV
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install eea.sparql into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * When you're reading this you have probably already run
          ``easy_install eea.sparql``. Find out how to install setuptools
          (and EasyInstall) here:
          http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
          via::
        
              python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance
        
          into your Zope instance.
        
        * Create a file called ``eea.sparql-configure.zcml`` in the
          ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
          should only contain this::
        
              <include package="eea.sparql" />
        
        .. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``eea.sparql`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            eggs = eea.sparql
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            zcml = eea.sparql
        
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
        
        You will also need a worker instance to be set up. This is required for the async
        update of the last working results.
        
        * For both, normal and worker instances, the plone.app.async should be added in
          the EGG slug::
        
              eggs =
                ...
                plone.app.async
        
        * For the normal instances, the plone.app.async-single_db_instance should be
          added in the ZCML slug::
        
              zcml =
                ...
                plone.app.async-single_db_instance
        
        * For the worker instances, the plone.app.async-single_db_worker should be
          added in the ZCML slug::
        
              zcml =
                ...
                plone.app.async-single_db_worker
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
