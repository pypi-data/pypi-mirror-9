        Goals
        -----
        
        A _Linked Data Notebook_, supporting collection, organization and sharing of structured and semi-structured data.  The name "annalist" derives from ["a person who writes annals"](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/annalist).
        
        * Easy data: out-of-box data acquisition, modification and organization of small data records.
        * Flexible data: new record types and fields can be added as-required.
        * Sharable data: use textual, easy to read file formats that can be shared by web, email, file transfer, version management system, memory stick, etc.
        * Remixable data: records that can be first class participants in a wider ecosystem of linked data, with links in and links out.
