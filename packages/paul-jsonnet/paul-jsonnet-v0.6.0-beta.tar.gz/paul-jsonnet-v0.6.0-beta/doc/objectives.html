<h1>Objectives</h1>

<p> <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a> has emerged as the defacto standard for communication of
structured data, both between machines and at the human / machine boundary.  However, in large
quantities JSON can be unwieldy for humans, with duplication that needs to be kept in sync between
different parts of the data structure.  Many people address this by writing scripts that generate
JSON, but typically these are written in general purpose programming languages like Python where
maintaining them can be non-trivial.</p>

<p> Jsonnet attempts to solve this problem in a specialized and principled way, according to the
following criteria: </p>

<ul>

<li><b>Hermiticity</b>:  Code may be treated as data.  The same JSON should be generated regardless
of the environment.  There should be no non-deterministic or system-dependent behaviors.  </li>

<li><b>Templating Language</b>:  Code should be interleaved with verbatim data so that it is easy to
maintain the two in synchrony.  The success of template languages are proof of this approach's
effectiveness.</li>

<li><b>Familiarity</b>:  Raw data should be specified as JSON.  Computation constructs should behave
predictably.</li>

<li><b>Powerful yet simple</b>: Trivial cases should be trivial.  More complex cases should be
approachable with additional complexity being localized.  Everything must be <i>possible</i>, yet
the language must still have a small footprint for learning and building new tools.</li>

<li><b>Modularity</b>:  As configurations grow, it must be possible to manage the complexity using
standard techniques for <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808431">programming in the
large</a>.</li>

<li><b>Reuse</b>:  The same language should be usable on a wide variety of systems, ideally all
things should be controlled via a well-maintained centralized configuration.</li>

<li><b>Rigor</b>: Different implementations of the language must be possible, via an
authoritative specification that is complete and simple enough to understand.  The language should
not be defined by implementation.  </li>

</ul>


<h2>General Design</h2>


<p>The language is designed to be implementable via desugaring, i.e. there is a simple core language
and the other constructs are translated down to this core language before interpretation.  This
technique allows a language to have considerable expressive power, while remaining easy to
implement.</p>


<h2>Modularity and Encapsulation</h2>

<p>In Jsonnet, a <dfn>module</dfn> is typically a Jsonnet file that defines an object whose fields
contain useful values, such as functions or objects that can specialized for a particular purpose
via extension.  Using an object at the top level of the module allows adding other fields later on,
without having to alter user code.  When writing such a module, it is advisable to expose only the
interface to the module, and not its implementation.  This is called encapsulation, and it allows
changing the implementation later, despite the module being imported by many other Jsonnet files.
</p>

<p>Jsonnet's primary feature for encapsulation is the <code>local</code> keyword.  This makes it
possible to define variables that are visible only to the module, and impossible to access from
outside.  The following is a simple example.  Other code can import <tt>util.jsonnet</tt> but will
not be able to see the <code>internal</code> object, and therefore not the function
<code>square</code>.</p>

<pre><code>// util.jsonnet
local internal = {
    square(x):: x*x,
};
{
    euclidianDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2)::
        std.sqrt(internal.square(x2-x1) + internal.square(y2-y1)),
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is also possible to store <code>square</code> in a field, which exposes it to those importing
the module:</p>

<pre><code>// util2.jsonnet
{
    square(x):: x*x,
    euclidianDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2)::
        std.sqrt(self.square(x2-x1) + self.square(y2-y1)),
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows users to redefine the square function, as shown in the very strange code below.  In
some cases, this is actually what you want and is very useful.  But it does make it harder to
maintain backwards compatibility.  For example, if you later change the implementation of
<code>euclidianDistance</code> to inline the square call, then user code will behave
differently.</p>

<pre><code>// myfile.jsonnet
local util2 = import "util2.jsonnet" { square(x):: x*x*x };
{
    crazy: util2.euclidianDistance(1,2,3,4)
}
</code></pre>

<p> In conclusion, Jsonnet allows you to either expose these details or hide them.  So choose
wisely, and know that everything you expose will potentially be used in ways that you didn't
expect.  Keep your interface small if possible.</p>

<p>A common belief is that languages should make <code>local</code> the default state, with an
explicit construct to allow outside access.  This ensures that things are not accidentally (or
apathetically) exposed.  In the case of Jsonnet, backwards compatibility with JSON prohibits that
design since in JSON everything is a visible field.</p>

<h2>Rationale for Turing-Completeness</h2>

<p>Jsonnet is Turing-complete as it is possible to write non-terminating programs.  Configurations
should always terminate, so ideally we would prevent this.  However doing so in general is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">impossible</a> and even when constrained to
practical use cases, it remains impractical.  Typical approaches for enforcing termination either
restrict the language (e.g. to primitive recursion), which makes some programs impossible /
difficult to write, or, alternatively, require the programmer to provide evidence that the program
terminates, via some sort of annotation / <a
href="http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/8">energy function</a>.  Both of these make the
programmer's life more difficult.  </p>

<p> Furthermore, non-Turing complete languages can take arbitrary CPU or RAM by running intensive
algorithms on large input.  So enforcing termination is firstly not practical, and secondly does not
actually solve the more practical problem of bounding resource consumption during execution.</p>

<p>For Jsonnet we decided restricting termination would create more problems than it would
solve.</p>

<h2>Rationale for Dynamic Typing</h2>

<p>Programmers do not like bureaucracy.  Typically <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">type systems</a> either require annotations, use
type inference, or are dynamic.  The former two approaches have two advantages:  Some errors can be
detected earlier (conservatively -- some correct programs are also rejected).  Also, they can be
implemented more efficiently since the additional knowledge about the program means special memory
representations can be used, and also some instructions can be elided.  However annotations are
additional bureaucracy and type inference produces unification errors that the programmer has to
understand and fix.</p>

<p>Dynamic typing means checking types at run-time, and raising errors via the language's existing
error reporting mechanism.  This is conceptually much simpler for the programmer.  In a
configuration language, runtime performance is not as important as other languages, and additionally
programs tend to execute quickly so testing is much easier.</p>

<p>For Jsonnet we decided that simplicity was far more important than the minimal benefits of
runtime efficiency and static error detection in this context.</p>

<h2>Rationale for Object-Oriented Semantics</h2>

 The object oriented features are ideal for
deriving variants from templates.

object-based

mixins

<h2>Rationale for Pure Functional Semantics</h2>

Since it has no side-effects, the JSON can be regenerated at any time, and
since it is deterministic, this will always result in the same output JSON.  

 Functional languages
are ideal for refining and processing structured data. 

<h2>Rationale for Lazy Semantics</h2>

<p>The late binding from the object oriented semantics already embodies some of the features of a lazy
language.  Errors do not occur unless a field is actually dereferenced, and cyclic structures can be
created.  For example the following is valid even in an eager version of the language:</p>

<pre><code>local x = {a:"apple", b:y.b},
      y = {a:x.a, b:"banana"};
x
</code></pre>

<p> It would therefore be confusing if the following was not also valid, which leads us to lazy
semantics for arrays.  </p>

<pre><code>local x = ["apple", y[1]],
      y = [x[0], "banana"];
x
</code></pre>

<p> Therefore, for consistency, the whole language is lazy.  It does not harm the language to be
lazy:  Performance is not significantly affected, stack traces are still possible, and it doesn't
interfere with I/O (because there is no I/O).  There is also a precedent for laziness, e.g. in
Makefiles and the Nix expression language.</p>

<p> Arguably, laziness brings real benefits in terms of abstraction and modularity.  It
is possible to build infinite data-structures, and there is unrestricted beta expansion.  For
example, the following 2 snippets of code are only equivalent in a lazy language.  </p>

<pre><code>if x == 0 then 0 else if x &gt; 0 then 1 / x else -1/x
</code></pre>

<pre><code>local r = 1 / x;
if x == 0 then 0 else if x &gt; 0 then r else -r
</code></pre>

<h2>Rationale for &amp;&amp; and || operators</h2>
