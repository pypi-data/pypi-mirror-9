Description: A drop-in replacement for BibTeX based on string templates.
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        
        Bibulous provides a flexible way of accomplishing the same tasks as BibTeX, and going far
        beyond it in capability. The advantages include:
        
          - Fully internationalized: Bibulous can use bibliography databases and bibliography style
            files written in any language.
          - Simple and powerful customization: style templates are an ideal way of visualizing and
            manipulating bibliography styles. There is no need to learn BibTeX's arcane stack-based
            language in order to build or customize a bibliography style.
          - Multilingual capability: templates are largely language agnostic, so that multilingual
            bibliographies can be achieved almost effortlessly.
          - Allows users to build glossaries, lists of symbols, and lists of acronyms using the
            same infrastructure as with bibliographies.
          - Sorting of citations is fully localized and has no difficulty in dealing with strings
            that contain Unicode, LaTeX-markup characters for non-English languages, or even
            mathematics markup.
        
        This version requires Python 2.7 or later.
