        This product, ``eke.publications``, provides display and RDF_ ingest of
        publications (articles, books, journal entries, etc.) for the Early Detection
        Research Network (EDRN_) Knowledge Environment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to
        make it easy to discover, share, search for, and retrieve all of EDRN's
        collective knowledge, including cancers and other diseases, biomarkers,
        specimens, investigators, participants, studies, protocols, and-as in the
        case of this product-publications.
        
        Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any
        Plone_ compatible site.
        
        This software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,
        operated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.
        
        • Add ``eke.publications`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
         
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                eke.publications
                
        • Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
          
            % ./bin/buildout
                
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
