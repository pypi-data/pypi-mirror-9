Download & Install
==================

Here you'll find all the necessary explanations for installing OpenCobolIDE.


Requirements:
-------------
OpenCobolIDE depends on the following packages:

    - Python 3
    - PyQt5 or PyQt4
    - OpenCobol
    - pyqode.core
    - pyqode.cobol
    - pygments

GNU/Linux
---------

Install pyqt5, open-cobol and pip for python3 using your package manager, then run the
following commands::

    sudo pip3 install OpenCobolIDE --upgrade


If you are on Archlinux, you can install OpenCobolIDE and all its dependencies
from the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/open-cobol-ide/

.. note:: if you have both PyQt5 and PyQt4 on your system, the IDE will use
          PyQt5 by default. To force the use of PyQt4, you should set the
          ``QT_API`` environment variable to ``pyqt4``.

.. note:: If you installed the compiler in a non-standard path and it is not recognized, you
          can specify and the path to the compiler in the preferences dialog under the ``Build & Run`` section. Just
          make sure to only specify the directory where the compiler can be found, not the full path.
