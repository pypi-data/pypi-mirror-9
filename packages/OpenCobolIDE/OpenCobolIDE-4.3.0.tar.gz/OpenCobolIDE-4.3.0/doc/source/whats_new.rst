What's New?
===========
This page lists the most prominent milestones achieved by the OpenCobolIDE
developers. For more specific details about what is planned and what has been 
accomplished, please visit the `issues page on github`_.

Next Version
------------

We plan to improve the code template mechanism to let you define your own code
template that will be used for new file creation. We might also add a small
macro system to automatically fill up details such as author, date, and so
on...

4.0.0
+++++

The entire application has been rewritten.

The cobol code editor widget has been moved to the pyqode.cobol package.

New features:

- code folding
- improved auto indentation (after if/else/perform)
- reworked user interface: the default view (from v2) is back as the
  default view but you can switch to the minimal view (from v3) by double
  clicking an editor tab (see issue #47)

  current editor

3.0.0
+++++

New features:

- add **Mac OSX** support
- move to **PyQt5** (to support retina screens)
- add support for **pyQode 2.0**:
  the new api is a lot more stable API and is now fully
  tested. The editor style and performances have been improved but **the
  folding panel has been temporarely removed** *(for performance reason)*
- **new user interface**:
  the menu and toolbar has gone, instead there is now a compile and run button
  inside the editor and a drop down button in the status bar for the most
  important actions.
  The homepage and the preferences dialog also got redesigned.
- compiler process management has been improved:
  We are now using QProcess instead of subprocess, this allow some neat
  improvements such as auto compile before run.
- better log message + log window: include information from the log window
  when you report bugs!

Please, read the :doc:`/getting_started` section of this manual to get started
with the new user interface!
