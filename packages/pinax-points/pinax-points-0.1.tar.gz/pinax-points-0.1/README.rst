pinax-points
============

pinax-points, formerly agon, provides the ability to track points on arbitrary
objects in your system.  The common case being ``User`` instances. It can
additionally keep track of positions for these objects to produce leaderboards.

This code has mostly been pulled out of `typewar`_ and made slightly more
generic to work well.
