Vanilla
=======

Vanilla is a simple default theme for Ark. You can customize it or use it as a starting point for building themes of your own.


Menu Support
------------

Add a menu file to your site's `inc` folder containing a list of links in Markdown or Syntex format and Vanilla will display the links in its header and footer.

The menu file should be named `menu.md` or `menu.txt`.
