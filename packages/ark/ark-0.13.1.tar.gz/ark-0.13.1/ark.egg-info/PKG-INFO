        Ark is a static website generator in Python 3. It transforms a directory
        of text files written in `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_
        or `Syntex <https://github.com/dmulholland/syntex>`_ into a self-contained website
        that can be viewed locally or served remotely.
        
        See the `package documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/ark/>`_ or the project's
