 Features
==========

The main features of PySpice are:

 * actually PySpice only supports |Ngspice|_
 * an oriented-object API to describe circuit in a way similar to SPICE
 * a library and model manager that index recursively a directory
 * an incomplete SPICE parser (mainly used for the library and model indexer)
 * a circuit can be simulated using a subprocess (aka server mode) or using the NgSpice shared library,
   NgSpice vectors are converted to Numpy array
 * the NgSpice shared library permits to interact with the simulator and provides Python callback
   for external voltage and current source
 * some data analysis add-ons

Since PySpice is born with a learning goal, many examples are provided with the sources.  These
examples could serve as learning materials. A tool to generate an HTML and PDF documentation is
included in the *tools* directory. This tool could be extended to generate IPython Notebook as well.
