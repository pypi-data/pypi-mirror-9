Description: Introduction to the FreqDemod Package
        =====================================
        
        This package provides functions for analyzing and plotting the time-dependent frequency and amplitude of a sinusoidally oscillating signal.  Additional functions are provided for analyzing fluctuations in oscillator amplitude, phase, or frequency.  The provided functions should work equally well for any oscillating signal, although the included data-fitting and -plotting functions have been written with an oscillating atomic force microscope cantilever in mind.  The main frequency-demodulation algorithm's only assumption is that the oscillating signal contains a single frequency component (the carrier, in FM-radio terminology).
        
        Install
        -------
        
        This package requires the following packages.  If you use the Enthought Canopy Distribution, then you should install these packages first using Enthought's package manager.  If you do not install them first, then ``pip`` will install them for you
        
        * numpy 1.8.1
        
        * scipy 0.14.1
        
        * matplotlib 1.4.2
        
        * h5py 2.4.0 
        
        To install the package ::
        
            pip install FreqDemod
        
        To test that the installation worked, run ::
        
            python -c "from freqdemod.demodulate import Signal"
        
        Documentation and source code is available at
            
        * Documentation: http://FreqDemod.rtfd.org

        Install the development version
        -------------------------------
        
        To test the package, edit it, and compile the documentation, you will need 
        
        * fabric 1.10.1
        
        * Sphinx 1.2.3
        
        * nose 1.3.4
        
        * ipython 2.3.1
        
        To install the development version, first clone the package :: 
        
            git clone git@github.com:JohnMarohn/FreqDemod.git
            cd FreqDemod
            
        To confirm that everything is working, in the FreqDemod directory run ::
        
            nosetests
            
        or ::
        
            or nosetest -s -v
            
        or ::
        
            python setup.py test
            
        If you make modifications to the code, and want to try test drive your modifications, then run ::
        
            python setup.py develop
            
        Your modified code should now load when you ``import FreqDemod`` in your code.  To recreate the documentation, switch to the docs subdirectory, and run ::
        
            fab html
            fab open
            
        
        If successful, you should see the documentation appear in your webbrowser.  The documentation is created in the directory ``FreqDemod/docs/_build/html``.
        
        There is an example ipython notebook in the ``FreqDemod/freqdemod/docs`` directory.  Running the following command will convert the notebook to html and copy it to the documentation directory ::
        
            fab html_full

        Development History
        ===================
        
        2014/01/23
        ----------
        
        Release the package into the wild.
        
        2014/08/09 
        ----------
        
        The demodulate.py file has undergone a major rewrite!
        
        * The "quickstart" files are essentially all broken.  You may instead see how the new code works by running, at the command line, from the home directory of the package ::
        
            python freqdemod/demodulate.py --no-LaTeX --testsignal=sine
            python freqdemod/demodulate.py --no-LaTeX --testsignal=sinefm
            python freqdemod/demodulate.py --no-LaTeX --testsignal=sineexp
            
          Running these commands will bring up a number of windows.  You will have to click each window closed before the program will proceed and show you the next window.  Each window should have a pretty self-explanatory title I hope.  You can try the ``--LaTeX`` option to see all the plots in fancy LaTeX typesetting.
        
        * All the data is stored as an HDF5 file.  If you have the h5py package installed correctly, you should have available the ``h5ls`` command line program which is useful for inspecting the contents of HDF5 files.  Each of the above programs saves its data to a hidden HDF5 file.  You can see the files by running at the command line ::
        
            ls -ha | grep h5
        
          or simply looking for the files that start with a dot, ``.``, and end with ``.h5``.  To examine the contents of the HDF5 files produced by running ::
        
            h5ls -rv .temp_sine.h5
            h5ls -rv .temp_sine_fm.h5
            h5ls -rv .temp_sine_exp.h5
            
        * The code is only lightly documented.  To get an idea of how things work, start by looking at the functions ::
        
            testsignal_sine()
            testsignal_sine_fm()
            testsignal_sine_exp()
        
          in the ``demodulate.py`` program.
