    attribute
        an attribute is a variable that holds a value. attributes are used in order to customise the behaviour of actions which are executed during the bootstrap process.

    definition
        a definition is a YAML file that contains a collection of all actions (and associated attributes) which need to run during the bootstrap process in order to fully provision a node

    pattern
        a pattern is a YAML file which describes a node in terms of its unique_id (serial number or system MAC) and/or location in the network (neighbors)

    neighbordb
        neighbordb is a YAML file which contains a collection of patterns which can be used in order to map nodes to definitions

    resource pool
        a resource pool is a YAML file which provides a mapping between a set or resources and the nodes to which some of the resources might have been allocated to. The nodes are uniquely identified via their system MAC.

    unique_id
        the unique identifier for a node.  This can be configured, globally, to be the serial number (default) or system MAC address in the ztpserver.conf file
