-- Fuglu 0.6.2, 2014-09-05

 * reorganized script directory, added init/systemd scripts for the common linux distributions
 * added action DISCARD as alias to DELETE to be more consistent with postfix

   see: http://gryphius.github.io/fuglu/configuration-index.html#fetching-scan-time-configuration-values-from-a-database

   The suspect-id header can now be disabled

Developers:
 * plugdummy.py has new options (show default plugin config, lint plugin)
 * Spamassassin Plugin: now can pass "temporary headers" to SA. read from tag `SAPlugin.tempheader`. These headers are only visible to Spamassassin.

 * to add support for configuration domain/user overrides from a database use a fuglu.extension.sql.DBConfig object instead of self.config

 * suspect has a new method get_client_info which tries to extract helo, ip and reverse dns information from received headers
 * fuglu_control has a new command 'netconsole' which starts a python interactive shell on a network socket. This allows runtime debugging of plugins or fuglu itself.
