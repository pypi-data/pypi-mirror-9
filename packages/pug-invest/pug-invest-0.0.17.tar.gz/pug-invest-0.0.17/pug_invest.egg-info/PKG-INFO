        On a Posix System

        You really want to contribute, right?
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/hobson/pug-invest.git
        
        If your a user and not a developer, and have an up-to-date posix OS with
        the postgres, xml2, and xlst development packages installed, then just
        use ``pip``.
        
        ::
        
            pip install pug-invest
        
        Fedora
        ~~~~~~
        
        If you're on Fedora >= 16 but haven't done a lot of python binding
        development, then you'll need some libraries before pip will succeed.
        
        ::
        
            sudo yum install -y python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel gcc-gfortran python-scikit-learn postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-libs postgresql-devel
            pip install pug

        Even the releases are very unstable, but if you want to have the latest,
        most broken code
