=================================
garland: Python decorator mocking
=================================

Garland is simple, repeatable decorator mocking.

Why?
====

Decorators are applied at the time the decorated function is first imported, which
makes mocking them a bit more challenging.

Usage
=====

Provided you have a function like so::


    @my_decorator
    def something_cool(*args, **kwargs):
        ...
        return some_var

Where your `my_decoroator` decorator is defined in another module, you can mock
`my_decorator` so that you can test just the end decorated function.::

    @garland.tinsel('utils.decorators.my_decorator', 'very_cool.module')
    def test_something_cool(self):
        ...

Now `test_something` can test the return values from `something_cool` without
the decorator potentially returning a different value, or providing a different
function interface.

The `tinsel` decorator takes two arguments:

1. A dotted path to the decorator function you want to mock
2. A dotted path to the module in which your function - the one you're testing -
   is declared. If you're not importing the module like this in your tests then
   this will do you little good (see limits, below).

Limits
======

1. You need to import modules, not named functions, to work with garland.
2. For now this is only tested with decorator functions and function decorators
3. The mock turns your decorator into a pass-through, assuming that this is the
   way you want to mock it.
