EGENIX.COM COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT                    VERSION 1.3.0
________________________________________________________________________

1.  Introduction

    This "License Agreement" is between eGenix.com Software, Skills
    and Services GmbH ("eGenix.com"), having an office at
    Pastor-Loeh-Str. 48, D-40764 Langenfeld, Germany, and the
    Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise
    using this software in source or binary form and its associated
    documentation ("the Software").

2.  Terms and Definitions

    The "Software" covered under this License Agreement includes
    without limitation, all object code, source code, help files,
    publications, documentation and other programs, products or tools
    that are included in the official "Software Distribution"
    available from eGenix.com.

    The "Proof of Authorization" for the Software is a written and
    signed notice from eGenix.com providing evidence of the extent of
    authorizations the Licensee has acquired to use the Software and
    of Licensee's eligibility for future upgrade program prices (if
    announced) and potential special or promotional opportunities. As
    such, the Proof of Authorization becomes part of this License
    Agreement.

    Installation of the Software ("Installation") refers to the
    process of unpacking or copying the files included in the Software
    Distribution to an Installation Target.

    "Installation Target" refers to the target of an installation
    operation.  Targets are defined, among other parameters, in terms
    of the following definitions:

        1) "CPU" refers to a central processing unit which is able to
        store and/or execute the Software (a server, personal
        computer, virtual machine, or other computer-like device)
        using at most two (2) processors,

        2) "Site" refers to a single site of a company,

        3) "Corporate" refers to an unlimited number of sites of the
        company,

        4) "Developer CPU" refers to a single CPU used by at most one (1)
        developer.

    Additional terms may be defined as part of the Proof of Authorization.

    When installing the Software on a server CPU for use by other CPUs
    in a network, Licensee must obtain a License for the server CPU
    and for all client CPUs attached to the network which will make
    use of the Software by copying the Software in binary or source
    form from the server into their CPU memory. If a CPU makes use of
    more than two (2) processors, Licensee must obtain additional CPU
    licenses to cover the total number of installed processors. The
    number of cores per processor does not count towards this license
    limitation. Virtual machines always count as one (1) CPU. If a
    Developer CPU is used by more than one developer, Licensee must
    obtain additional Developer CPU licenses to cover the total number
    of developers using the CPU.

    "Commercial Environment" refers to any application environment
    which is aimed at directly or indirectly generating profit. This
    includes, without limitation, for-profit organizations, private
    educational institutions, work as independent contractor,
    consultant and other profit generating relationships with
    organizations or individuals. Governments and related agencies or
    organizations are also regarded as being Commercial Environments.

    "Non-Commercial Environments" are all those application
    environments which do not directly or indirectly generate profit.
    Public educational institutions and officially acknowledged
    private non-profit organizations are regarded as being
    Non-Commercial Environments in the aforementioned sense.

    "Educational Environments" are all those application environments
    which directly aim at educating children, pupils or students.
    This includes, without limitation, class room installations and
    student server installations which are intended to be used by
    students for educational purposes. Installations aimed at
    administrational or organizational purposes are not regarded as
    Educational Environment.

3.  License Grant

    Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement,
    eGenix.com hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, world-wide
    license to

	1) use the Software to the extent of authorizations Licensee has
	acquired and

	2) distribute, make and install copies to support the level of use
	authorized, providing Licensee reproduces this License Agreement
	and any other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy,
	of the Software.

    If Licensee acquires this Software as a program upgrade,
    Licensee's authorization to use the Software from which Licensee
    upgraded is terminated.

    Licensee will ensure that anyone who uses the Software does so
    only in compliance with the terms of this License Agreement.

    Licensee may not 

	1) use, copy, install, compile, modify, or distribute the
    	Software except as provided in this License Agreement;

	2) reverse assemble, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or
	otherwise translate the Software except as specifically
    	permitted by law without the possibility of contractual
    	waiver; or

	3) rent, sublicense or lease the Software.

4.  Authorizations

    The extent of authorization depends on the ownership of a Proof of
    Authorization for the Software.

    Usage of the Software for any other purpose not explicitly covered
    by this License Agreement or granted by the Proof of Authorization
    is not permitted and requires the written prior permission from
    eGenix.com.

5.  Modifications

    Software modifications may only be distributed in form of patches
    to the original files contained in the Software Distribution.

    The patches must be accompanied by a legend of origin and
    ownership and a visible message stating that the patches are not
    original Software delivered by eGenix.com, nor that eGenix.com can
    be held liable for possible damages related directly or indirectly
    to the patches if they are applied to the Software.

6.  Experimental Code or Features

    The Software may include components containing experimental code
    or features which may be modified substantially before becoming
    generally available.

    These experimental components or features may not be at the level
    of performance or compatibility of generally available eGenix.com
    products. eGenix.com does not guarantee that any of the
    experimental components or features contained in the eGenix.com
    will ever be made generally available.

7.  Expiration and License Control Devices

    Components of the Software may contain disabling or license
    control devices that will prevent them from being used after the
    expiration of a period of time or on Installation Targets for
    which no license was obtained.

    Licensee will not tamper with these disabling devices or the
    components. Licensee will take precautions to avoid any loss of
    data that might result when the components can no longer be used.

8.  NO WARRANTY

    eGenix.com is making the Software available to Licensee on an "AS
    IS" basis. SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE
    EXCLUDED, EGENIX.COM MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION,
    EGENIX.COM MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
    OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT
    THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

9.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
    SHALL EGENIX.COM BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF THE
    SOFTWARE FOR (I) ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
    OR LOSS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
    BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS
    INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) AS A RESULT OF USING,
    MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF,
    EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF; OR (II) ANY AMOUNTS IN
    EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS PAID TO EGENIX.COM UNDER THIS
    LICENSE AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEEDING
    THE DATE THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.

    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR
    LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.

10. Termination

    This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a
    material breach of its terms and conditions if not cured within
    thirty (30) days of written notice by eGenix.com. Upon
    termination, Licensee shall discontinue use and remove all
    installed copies of the Software.

11. Indemnification 

    Licensee hereby agrees to indemnify eGenix.com against and hold
    harmless eGenix.com from any claims, lawsuits or other losses that
    arise out of Licensee's breach of any provision of this License
    Agreement.

12. Third Party Rights 

    Any software or documentation in source or binary form provided
    along with the Software that is associated with a separate license
    agreement is licensed to Licensee under the terms of that license
    agreement. This License Agreement does not apply to those portions
    of the Software. Copies of the third party licenses are included
    in the Software Distribution.

13. High Risk Activities 

    The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed,
    manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control
    equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe
    performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities,
    aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control,
    direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the
    failure of the Software, or any software, tool, process, or
    service that was developed using the Software, could lead directly
    to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
    damage ("High Risk Activities").

    Accordingly, eGenix.com specifically disclaims any express or
    implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities.

    Licensee agree that eGenix.com will not be liable for any claims
    or damages arising from the use of the Software, or any software,
    tool, process, or service that was developed using the Software,
    in such applications.

14. General

    Nothing in this License Agreement affects any statutory rights of
    consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.

    Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any
    relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between
    eGenix.com and Licensee.

    If any provision of this License Agreement shall be unlawful,
    void, or for any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be
    modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable without
    losing its intent, or, if no such modification is possible, be
    severed from this License Agreement and shall not affect the
    validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
    License Agreement.

    This License Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in all
    respects by the law of Germany, excluding conflict of law
    provisions. It shall not be governed by the United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for International Sale of Goods.

    This License Agreement does not grant permission to use eGenix.com
    trademarks or trade names in a trademark sense to endorse or
    promote products or services of Licensee, or any third party.

    The controlling language of this License Agreement is English. If
    Licensee has received a translation into another language, it has
    been provided for Licensee's convenience only.

15. Agreement
