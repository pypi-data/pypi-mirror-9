eGenix mxODBC - ODBC Database Interface for Python
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

Please note that you need to install the eGenix.com mx Base package
before installing the mxODBC Distribution. You can find the download
and install instructions for the eGenix.com mx Base package on the
eGenix.com web-site at http://www.egenix.com/.

To test whether you have successfully installed the mx Base package,
run the following code:

$ cd ~
$ python
Python 2.7.6 (default, Dec  4 2013, 20:32:08)
[GCC 4.5.0 20100604 [gcc-4_5-branch revision 160292]] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from mx.DateTime import now
>>> print (now())
2014-03-18 00:26:31.56
>>>

This should not give any errors.

You will also have to have an ODBC manager installed on your system.
On Windows, the Windows ODBC manager comes with the OS. On Unix, there
are two ODBC managers to choose from: the iODBC manager
(http://www.iodbc.org/) and the unixODBC manager
(http://www.unixodbc.org/). Please make sure that at least one of
these is installed on the system.


Prebuilt Installation
---------------------

If you have downloaded a prebuilt distribution archive, you have to
run:

    python setup.py install

Next, install the license files (license.py and license.txt) in the
.../mx/ODBC/ directory of your installation. 

Finally, try to import the package:

$ cd ~
$ python
Python 2.7.6 (default, Dec  4 2013, 20:32:08)
[GCC 4.5.0 20100604 [gcc-4_5-branch revision 160292]] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> # Try these on Unix only (at least one of them should work):
>>> import mx.ODBC.iODBC
>>> import mx.ODBC.unixODBC
>>> import mx.ODBC.DataDirect
>>> # Try this on Windows only:
>>> import mx.ODBC.Windows
>>>

At least one of the imports should succeed and not give any errors.
