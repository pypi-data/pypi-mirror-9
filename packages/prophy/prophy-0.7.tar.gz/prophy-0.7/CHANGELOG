0.7
-----------------------------------
- prophy & prophyc: python 3.4 support added

0.6
-----------------------------------
- prophyc: isar mode includes
- prophyc: sack mode warnings and errors
- prophyc: prophylang mode includes
- prophyc: prophylang constant, enumerator and struct array size expressions

0.5.1
-----------------------------------
- prophyc cpp output: generated headers contain declarations of swap template functions
- prophy cpp library: single swap function template and implementation details hidden

0.5
-----------------------------------
- new cpp full output, exposes structs and unions as classes with value semantics,
  provides means to encode/decode them in different endiannesses and print them
- prophy python library: union/optional alignment/padding bug fixed
- prophy python library: padding is always encoded after struct, even if it ends with an array
- prophy python library: empty line in stringified struct with empty optional field bug fixed
- documentation: encoding padding explained in-depth

0.4.2
-----------------------------------
- added documentation
- python prophy: encoding and decoding optimized

0.4.1
-----------------------------------
- installs dependencies automatically,
  dependency on plyplus removed, plain ply used instead
- prophyc: parsing error checking and reporting improved
- prophyc: version showing
- prophy: fixed array decoding error with array size bigger than 255
- prophy: version attribute

0.4
-----------------------------------
- prophyc: dedicated input language based on xdr and thrift

0.3
-----------------------------------

- prophyc: cpp output added
- prophyc: bitMaskOr and shiftLeft operators are translated by isar parser
- cpp prophy: new output consists of structs defining messages and endianness swap algorithms
- python prophy: messages with multiple dynamic fields are split in parts in such way that
  first part has alignment of all fields and each following part has alignment of its fields

0.2.5
-----------------------------------

- prophyc sorts symbols accorting to dependencies also in patched sack case
- prophy copy_from bug fixed

0.2.4
-----------------------------------

- prophyc sack mode doesn't use libclang to cross-compile for 32-bit platform
- prophyc sack mode removes all non-alphanumeric chars from identifiers in generic way
- prophy adds padding dynamically, which allows more freedom in using etc. strings

0.2.3
-----------------------------------

- prophyc dependency-sorts nodes in its model again after patching

0.2.2
-----------------------------------

- prophyc sack parses anonymous structs in files with hyphens in path name correctly

0.2.1
-----------------------------------

- prophyc sack parser parses incomplete arrays

0.2
-----------------------------------

- prophy structs, unions and arrays with enums return enum type instances instead of ints
  enum instance has access to enumerator name string

0.1
-----------------------------------

- isar input (xml parser from standard library)
- sack input (C++ parser based on python clang and libclang, version at least 3.4)
- python output (python descriptors turned into codecs by python prophy library)
- patch mechanism (allows to modify parsed structures before rendering output)
