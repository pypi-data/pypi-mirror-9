Introduction
============

``collective.celery`` provides the necessary bits to use `Celery <http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ within `Plone <http://plone.org/>`_.

Much of the code here is based off of David Glick's gists, Asko's work and `pyramid_celery <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_celery/>`_.

More information in "docs".
