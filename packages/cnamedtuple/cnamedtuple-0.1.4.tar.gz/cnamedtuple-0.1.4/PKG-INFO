Description: cnamedtuple 0.1.4
        =================
        
        An implementation of namedtuple written in c for warp speed.
        
        Tested against Python3.4.2 and Python3.5 0a0.
        
        Warp Speed
        ----------
        
        Time to go fast.
        
        Setup
        ~~~~~
        
        Use qualified imports so that we can tell which namedtuple we are using.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> from namedtuple import namedtuple as cnamedtuple
            >>> from collections import namedtuple as stdnamedtuple
            >>> from pickle import dumps, loads
        
        Little numbers
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Cute graphs
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        These operations scale with the number of fields.

        Less cute numbers
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        These operations do not scale with number of fields.
        
        ``std_inst`` is an instance of a ``collections.namedtuple`` created type
        with six named fields: a, b, c, d, e, and f.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [1]: %%timeit
               ...: std_inst.c
            10000000 loops, best of 3: 108 ns per loop
        
        ``c_inst`` is an instance of a ``cnamedtuple.namedtuple`` created type
        with six named fields: a, b, c, d, e, and f.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [2]: %%timeit
               ...: c_inst.c
            10000000 loops, best of 3: 47.8 ns per loop
