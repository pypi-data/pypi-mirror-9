I simple utility to sign http requests given some private key

To run the python tests

1. pip install -r requirements/test.txt
2. nosetests

To run the example using flask

1. pip install -r requirements/example.txt
2. python app.py
3. open a browser and point to http://localhost:5000/

After you invoke the GET request above you should see a request in the terminal

GET /verify?__client_id=example&username=foo&password=bar&__signature=somestrangestuffhere

This shows the client in action but at this time our example does not truly verify the signed request
