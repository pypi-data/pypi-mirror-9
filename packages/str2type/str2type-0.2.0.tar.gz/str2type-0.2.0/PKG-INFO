Description: str2type
        ========
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geowurster/str2type.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geowurster/str2type) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/geowurster/str2type/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/geowurster/str2type)
        
        Convert a string representation of an int, float, None, True, False, or JSON
        to its native type.  For None, True, and False, case is irrelevant.  The
        primary use-case of this function is automatically parsing user-input from
        the commandline into Python types.  Argument parsers usually handle this no
        problem but if a flag can take multiple types then `str2type()` can serve
        as the decoder.
        
            >>> from str2type import str2type
            >>> print(str2type("1.23"))
            1.23
            >>> print(str2type("1.")
            1.0
            >>> print(str2type(".2"))
            0.2
            >>> print(str2type("NonE"))
            None
            >>> print(str2type("String"))
            "String"
