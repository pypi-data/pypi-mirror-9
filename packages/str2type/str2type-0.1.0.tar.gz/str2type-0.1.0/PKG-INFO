Description: str2type
        ========
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geowurster/str2type.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geowurster/str2type)
        
        Convert a string representation of an int, float, None, True, False, or JSON
        to its native type.  For None, True, and False, case is irrelevant.
        
            >>> from str2type import str2type
            >>> print(str2type("1.23"))
            1.23
        
        The user can also specify which JSON library to use for decoding should
        they know they will be encountering a lot of JSON, in which case a different
        library is probably more appropriate than this function.
        
            >>> from str2type import str2type
            >>> import ujson
            >>> print(str2type('[0,1,2,3,4]', json_lib=ujson))
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        
        Alternatively:
        
            >>> import str2type
            >>> import ujson
            >>> str2type.JSON = ujson
            >>> print(str2type('FaLsE'))
            False
        
        The brunt of the decoding is handled by `json`, which can decode all supported
        types except for strings and `None`.  If the user specifies a different JSON
        library it is still expected to be able to handle these types.
