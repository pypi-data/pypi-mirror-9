Description: Batteries
        ================================
        
        This module contains Paste templates, SQLAlchemy mixins, utility functions, and miscellany which experience has shown to be useful enough to require reusable packaging.
        
        This package may one day aspire to be useful to a wide audience, and so useful examples and comprehensive documentation might be found in this file. But for today, if you need it you know how to use it already. And if you really want to take a look at what it does, check out the tests.
