         Shout!
        ========
        
        **Loud Python messaging.**
        
        Shout is a single module providing simple messaging vocabulary for small applications. Shout is NOT a distributed messaging framework.
        
        ::
        
            from shout import Message, hears, shout
        
            class WhoAreYou(Message):
                pass
        
            @hears(WhoAreYou)
            def lucky_day():
                return "We are..."
        
            @hears(WhoAreYou)
            def dusty_bottoms():
                return "The threeee..."
        
            @hears(WhoAreYou)
            def ned_nederlander():
                return "Amigos!!"
        
            msg = shout(WhoAreYou)
            print("".join(msg.results))
        
            # We are...The threeee...Amigos!!
        
        
        Why Shout
        =========
        
        * Decoupling of a GUI and it's behavior
        
          * PySide/PyQt signals are bound to widgets making it harder to decouple widgets. You have to explicitly connect each widget's signals with their slots which could live deep in a hierarchy of widgets.
        
          * Shout Messages are classes themselves, readily available to all other objects in their scope. Shout from inside, outside, top, or bottom of a widget hierarchy, Messages will still get to where they need to go!
        
        * Shout is a single module, easily included with any package.
        
        * It's easy and fun to use.
        
        
        Get Shout
        =========
        
        Shout is available through the python package index as **pyshout**.
        
        ::
        
            pip install pyshout
        
        * Note that only the python package name is pyshout, the module it installs is simply **shout**.
