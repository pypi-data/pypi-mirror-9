Python bindings to the OpenStack Manila API
===========================================

This is a client for OpenStack Manila API. There's :doc:`a Python API
<api>` (the :mod:`manilaclient` module), and a :doc:`command-line script
<shell>` (installed as :program:`manila`). Each implements the entire
OpenStack Manila API.

You'll need credentials for an OpenStack cloud that implements the
Manila API in order to use the manila client.

Testing
-------

Manilaclient has two types of tests - 'unit' and 'functional'.

The preferred way to run tests is using ``tox``.

See `Consistent Testing Interface`_ for more details.

Functional tests
----------------

Functional CLI tests require several things to be able to run:
- Deployed and working manila service.
- Configured config file.

Config file is used to get information like 'auth_url', 'username',
'tenant_name' and 'password'.
To get config sample need to run following 'tox' job:
$ tox -e genconfig
This will create file 'etc/manilaclient/manilaclient.conf.sample' with all
available config opts.
Then rename it removing ".sample" and set values for opts there. After it,
tests can be run using following tox job:
$ tox -e functional
