Binaries for some platforms are available from the assembla files area
https://www.assembla.com/spaces/chdkptp/documents

*NOTE*: Google chrome may block the windows binary zip as malware, because
Google has decided that any unknown, unsigned exe *is* malware. If you want
to use chdkptp, view all downloads and "recover" the file (ignoring the
bullshit message that program "will harm your computer") or use a different
browser. Or if you don't trust me (and why should you?) build from source.

There is no installer, just unzip the file wherever you want.

h2. Windows

* You must install a libusb driver to connect to cameras. Instructions
  are available on the CHDK wiki at
  http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/PTP_Extension#LibUSB_Driver_for_Windows
* After the driver is configured, simply run the executable. If you double 
  click on the .exe, the GUI will start. If you want to start the cli, 
  run chdkptp -i

h2. Linux

If a binary for your particular flavor of Linux is not available, you must build
from source. Some instructions can be found in README.TXT

Current linux binary packages include both cli and gui executables named
chdkptp and chdkptp_gui respectively. Adjust chdkptp-sample.sh to use the
desired executable and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as needed.

To use the GUI executable in the raspberry pi package, you must also download
the raspberry pi library package (chdkptp-raspbian-libs-20140331.zip) from the
files area and set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to it.

To use the GUI in the Linux x64 package executable, you must installed the
corresponding IUP and CD libraries from those projects download areas. The
specific libraries used for each snapshot build will be linked in the changelog.

h3. Environment

To allow chdkptp to locate it's Lua files and libraries, it is necessary to set
some environment variables. chdkptp-sample.sh in the zip provides an example.
* set CHDKPTP_DIR to the path where you unzipped the files (the directory
  containing the chdkptp binary)
* If you are using a GUI build and the IUP and CD libraries are not on your
  default LD_LIBRARY_PATH, add them to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
* If the package includes both GUI and non-GUI executables, set CHDKPTP_EXE
  to the desired executable.

h3. Interactions with default software 

On Linux, default camera software may connect to the camera automatically. The
details will depend on the Linux distribution and configuration. In general,
most modern distros use
https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev/udev.html
to handle hot plugged USB devices. For PTP capable devices this will often
invoke some kind of auto mount, which will often put the camera in a state
where it cannot be fully controlled by chdkptp.

h3. Permissions issues

In some configurations, the camera will only be accessible to the root user by
default. udev is generally used to control permissions on hot plugged devices.
