        Often a user might want to see which process maps a particular physical
        offset. In reality the same physical memory can be mapped into multiple
        processes (and the kernel) at the same time. Usually since the kernel
        memory is mapped into each process's address space, a single physical
        offset which is mapped into the kernel will also be mapped into each
        process.

        The only way to tell if a physical page is mapped into a process is to
        enumerate all process maps and then search them for the physical
        offset. This takes a fair bit of memory and effort to build so by
        default we store the maps in the session for quick reuse.
