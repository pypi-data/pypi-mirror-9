 Customizing Virtualenvwrapper
===============================

virtualenvwrapper adds several hook points you can use to change your
settings, shell environment, or other configuration values when
creating, deleting, or moving between environments. These hooks are
exposed in two ways. :ref:`scripts` allows a user to perform generic actions
for every virtualenv in your environment, including customization of
virtualenv creation. :ref:`plugins` makes it possible to share common
behaviors between systems and developers.
