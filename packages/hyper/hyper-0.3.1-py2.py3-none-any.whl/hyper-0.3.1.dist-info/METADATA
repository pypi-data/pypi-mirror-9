HTTP is changing under our feet. HTTP/1.1, our old friend, is being
supplemented by the brand new HTTP/2 standard. HTTP/2 provides many benefits:
improved speed, lower bandwidth usage, better connection management, and more.

``hyper`` provides these benefits to your Python code. How? Like this::

    from hyper import HTTP20Connection

    conn = HTTP20Connection('http2bin.org:443')
    conn.request('GET', '/get')
    resp = conn.getresponse()

    print(resp.read())

Simple.

Caveat Emptor!
==============

Please be warned: ``hyper`` is in a very early alpha. You *will* encounter bugs
when using it. In addition, there are very many rough edges. With that said,
please try it out in your applications: I need your feedback to fix the bugs
and file down the rough edges.

Versions
========

``hyper`` supports the final draft of the HTTP/2 specification: additionally,
it provides support for drafts 14, 15, and 16 of the HTTP/2 specification. It
also supports the final draft of the HPACK specification.

Compatibility
=============

``hyper`` is intended to be a drop-in replacement for ``http.client``, with a
similar API. However, ``hyper`` intentionally does not name its classes the
same way ``http.client`` does. This is because most servers do not support
HTTP/2 at this time: I don't want you accidentally using ``hyper`` when you
wanted ``http.client``.

Contributing
============

``hyper`` welcomes contributions from anyone! Unlike many other projects we are
happy to accept cosmetic contributions and small contributions, in addition to
large feature requests and changes.

Before you contribute (either by opening an issue or filing a pull request),
please `read the contribution guidelines`_.

Release History
===============

0.3.1 (2015-04-03)
------------------

*Bugfixes*

- Fix blocking ``ImportError``. (`Issue #114`_)

.. _Issue #114: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/114

0.3.0 (2015-04-03)
------------------

*New Features*

- HTTP/1.1 support! See the documentation for more. (`Issue #75`_)
- Implementation of a ``HTTPHeaderMap`` data structure that provides dictionary
  style lookups while retaining all the semantic information of HTTP headers.

*Major Changes*

- Various changes in the HTTP/2 APIs:

  - The ``getheader``, ``getheaders``, ``gettrailer``, and ``gettrailers``
    methods on the response object have been removed, replaced instead with
    simple ``.headers`` and ``.trailers`` properties that contain
    ``HTTPHeaderMap`` structures.
  - Headers and trailers are now bytestrings, rather than unicode strings.
  - An ``iter_chunked()`` method was added to repsonse objects that allows
    iterating over data in units of individual data frames.
  - Changed the name of ``getresponse()`` to ``get_response()``, because
    ``getresponse()`` was a terrible name forced upon me by httplib.

.. _Issue #75: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/75

0.2.2 (2015-04-03)
------------------

*Bugfixes*

- Hyper now correctly handles 'never indexed' header fields. (`Issue #110`_)

.. _Issue #110: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/110

0.2.1 (2015-03-29)
------------------

*New Features*

- There is now a `hyper` command-line client that supports making HTTP/2
  requests directly from the command-line.

*Major Changes*

- Support for the final drafts of HTTP/2 and HPACK. Updated to offer the 'h2'
  ALPN token.

*Minor Changes*

- We not only remove the Connection header but all headers it refers to.

0.2.0 (2015-02-07)
------------------

*Major Changes*

- Python 2.7.9 is now fully supported.

0.1.2 (2015-02-07)
------------------

*Minor Changes*

- We now remove the ``Connection`` header if it's given to us, as that header
  is not valid in HTTP/2.

*Bugfixes*

- Adds workaround for HTTPie to make our responses look more like urllib3
  responses.

0.1.1 (2015-02-06)
------------------

*Minor Changes*

- Support for HTTP/2 draft 15, and 16. No drop of support for draft 14.
- Updated bundled certificate file.

*Bugfixes*

- Fixed ``AttributeError`` being raised when a PING frame was received, thanks
  to @t2y. (`Issue #79`_)
- Fixed bug where large frames could be incorrectly truncated by the buffered
  socket implementation, thanks to @t2y. (`Issue #80`_)

.. _Issue #79: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/79
.. _Issue #80: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/80

0.1.0 (2014-08-16)
------------------

*Regressions and Known Bugs*

- Support for Python 3.3 has been temporarily dropped due to features missing
  from the Python 3.3 ``ssl`` module. PyOpenSSL has been identified as a
  replacement, but until NPN support is merged it cannot be used. Python 3.3
  support *will* be re-added when a suitable release of PyOpenSSL is shipped.
- Technically this release also includes support for PyPy and Python 2.7. That
  support is also blocked behind a suitable PyOpenSSL release.

For more information on these regressions, please see `Issue #37`_.

*Major Changes*

- Support for HPACK draft 9.
- Support for HTTP/2 draft 14.
- Support for Sever Push, thanks to @alekstorm. (`Issue #40`_)
- Use a buffered socket to avoid unnecessary syscalls. (`Issue #56`_)
- If `nghttp2`_ is present, use its HPACK encoder for improved speed and
  compression efficiency. (`Issue #60`_)
- Add ``HTTP20Response.gettrailer()`` and ``HTTP20Response.gettrailers()``,
  supporting downloading and examining HTTP trailers. (Discussed in part in
  `Issue #71`_.)

*Bugfixes*

- ``HTTP20Response`` objects are context managers. (`Issue #24`_)
- Pluggable window managers are now correctly informed about the document size.
  (`Issue #26`_)
- Header blocks can no longer be corrupted if read in a different order to the
  one in which they were sent. (`Issue #39`_)
- Default window manager is now smarter about sending WINDOWUPDATE frames.
  (`Issue #41`_ and `Issue #52`_)
- Fixed inverted window sizes. (`Issue #27`_)
- Correct reply to PING frames. (`Issue #48`_)
- Made the wheel universal, befitting a pure-Python package. (`Issue #46`_)
- HPACK encoder correctly encodes header sets with duplicate headers.
  (`Issue #50`_)

0.0.4 (2014-03-08)
------------------

- Add logic for pluggable objects to manage the flow-control window for both
  connections and streams.
- Raise new ``HPACKDecodingError`` when we're unable to validly map a
  Huffman-encoded string.
- Correctly respect the HPACK EOS character.

0.0.3 (2014-02-26)
------------------

- Use bundled SSL certificates in addition to the OS ones, which have limited
  platform availability. (`Issue #9`_)
- Connection objects reset to their basic state when they're closed, enabling
  them to be reused. Note that they may not be reused if exceptions are thrown
  when they're in use: you must open a new connection in that situation.
- Connection objects are now context managers. (`Issue #13`_)
- The ``HTTP20Adapter`` correctly reuses connections.
- Stop sending WINDOWUPDATE frames with a zero-size window increment.
- Provide basic functionality for gracelessly closing streams.
- Exhausted streams are now disposed of. (`Issue #14`_)

------------------

  (`Issue #16`_)
- `HTTP20Connection` objects are now context managers. (`Issue #13`_)
