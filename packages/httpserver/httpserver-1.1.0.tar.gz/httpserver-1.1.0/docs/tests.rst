Testing considerations
======================

We use both unit tests and integration tests with selenium.

Unit Tests
----------
We mock the transport (socket) in the unit test, so we don't actually start up the
server, we just test the ``HttpProtocol`` itself.
To forge the request headers, we use fixtures that are appended in the ``tests/``
directory.

We test the following basic scenarios:

- GET for an existing single resource
  [``test_get_index_named``]
- GET for a single resource that doens't exit
- GET for an existing single resource followed by a GET for that same resource,
  using the ETag and ``If-None-Match`` field
  [``test_get_with_etag``]
- GET for a directory with an existing index.html
  [``test_get_index_root``]
- GET for a directory wit non-existing index.html
  [``test_get_directory_without_index``]
- Testing persistent connections, with the last GET prompting to close the
  connection
  [``test_get_persistent``]
- Test whether the timeout actually closes the connection
  [``test_timeout``, ``test_timeout_request``]

Additionally to the given scenarios above, we test some basic functionality
[ ``test_invalid_method``, ``test_invalid_http_version``, ``test_get_absoluteURI``,
``test_get_absoluteURI_404``, ``test_get_has_date_headers``, ``test_send_keepalive``,
``test_send_keepalive_longer`` ]

Selenium Tests
--------------

To use the selenium tests, ``firefox`` is a required dependency. We use two
simple selenium tests to test the HTTP server with a real browser. Two tests
scenarios are implemented:

1. Test whether GET on the root dir (with an ``index.html``) actually returns
   that index. ``index.html`` is a simple web page with two images, to test
   parallel GET requests and basic pipeling.

2. Test whether a non-existing resource sends a correct 404 response, and that
   the response is displayed to the user.

If you do not wish to use Firefox, you can set the environment variable
``SELENIUM_WEBDRIVER`` to either ``chrome`` or ``phantomjs``. If you set
a different driver, you will need to have it installed as well.
