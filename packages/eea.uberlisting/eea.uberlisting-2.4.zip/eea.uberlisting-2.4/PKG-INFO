        Introduction
        ============
        `EEA Uberlisting`_  enhances and extends the listing layouts capabilities of Plone.
        
        | By default this package can enable a view on the **Folder**, **Topic** and 
          **Collection** Content Type, which when enabled it gives the web visitor the
          ability to switch between the views that are available for that Content Type,
          instead of having a fixed one, all from the same template.
          
          
        | This listing is accomplished by loading the available template through ajax 
          passing in the the ajax_load parameter set by plonetheme.sunburst to 
          load the page without the columns and resources and then inject the result 
          in the UberlistingView.
        
        
        How to enable
        =============
        
        This view is enabled through an *action* called **Enable UberlistingView** 
        which is found within the **actions** *dropdown menu* for the content types
        mentioned in the introduction.
        
        
        Upgrade
        =======
         
        * As of 2.0 all of the **Plone tips and tricks** that are described in the section 
          of tips and tricks can be added through the Uberlisting View form  allowing
          therefore users without permission to the ZMI to make changes to the view
        
        Tips and tricks
        ===============
        
        Javascript tips
        ---------------
        
        Calling javascript on listing load
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        * After we load these results we trigger an event which you can hook on in order
          to modify the listing
        
          ::
        
           ex: $(window).bind('Uberlisting.Success', function(ev) {
                    // Run galleryView on the listing results
                    $('#content').galleryView();
               });
        
        Modify the returning listing
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
         
        * By default when doing the ajax load the load is checking if content-core is 
          available and if so it's content is added in the div with the id uber-view-content.
           
          If your template doesn't have the content inside the content-core div then it will
          return the results of the first div it find on the content that was returned from 
          the ajax load. 
           
          Therefore if you want to influence the result or your template doesn't
          have the content-core id than just wrap the desired content inside of div tag.
        
        Plone tips
        ----------
         
        * As mentioned in the upgrade steps these steps no longer need to be added
          manually, however by visiting manage_properties you can see these properties
          added after using the view form.
        
        Disable templates from showing up in the Uberlisting View
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        * In ZMI > context > manage_properties: Add a '*lines*' property named
          **bannedUberlistingTemplates**.
        
          Here add one by one the template id's that you would like to be skipped
          from the listing.
        
          ::
        
            ex: folder_summary_view
                folder_contents
        
        Set default template when visiting template for first time
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        * In ZMI > context > manage_properties: Add a '*string*' property named
          **defaultUberlistingTemplate** and add the template id that should be used
          as the default template.
            
          ::
            
            ex: folder_summary_view
        
          By default if this property isn't set and no cookie is present with the name
          of the default template then **folder_listing** will be used as default.
        
        Get listing of templates as images instead of template title name
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        * This packages looks for a png image to use for the views listing in the
          format of template id + '.png'.
            
          ::
            
            ex: folder_summary_view.png
        
          We have provides some images for the common Plone templates as well as
          some for our own templates, if you need a different style for the icons you can
          customize them TTW or you can have a skin layer before **uberlisting_imgs** with
          images that have the same name.
        
        * If no images are found then the template name will be displayed in the listing.
        
        * If you don't want to have the listing of templates with images and you would
          prefer to have only template name then In ZMI > context > manage_properties:
          Add a checked **boolean** property named '**noUberlistingTemplateImages**'
        
        EEA products integration tips
        -----------------------------
        
        Get enhanced thumbnails when used with eea.depiction
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        * If you have eea.depiction installed you can configure a fallback image for
          the contenttypes that do not have an image field by default, allowing the
          content to be displayed in  a view where the listing would look better
          with images like album view.
        
        Get enhanced search capabilities when used with eea.facetednavigation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        * If you have eea.facetednavigation installed you can use uberlisting_view as
          a view for the Faceted Navigation, allowing you to combine the search capabilities
          of it with the ability to change between views from the same template.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        zc.buildout
        -----------
        If you are using `zc.buildout`_ and the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Update your buildout.cfg file:
        
          * Add ``eea.uberlisting`` to the list of eggs to install
        
          * You can skip the ZCML slug since this package is using the z3c.autoinclude
            include directive
        
          ::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            eggs =
              ...
              eea.uberlisting
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
          $ ./bin/buildout
