Automated Install
=================
Disclaimer: You could damage your raspberry pi if you do not insert a voltage divider between the echo pin on the sensor and the GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi.
If you choose to do this you do it at your own risk.

Install Dependancies
====================

If you want to create graphs of sump pit activity install Matplotlib and Numpy
as follows;

    sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
    sudo apt-get install python-numpy

Also Requires RPi.GPIO module (see Install Raspi-Sump)

If pip package manager is not installed you can get the latest version at the
following site.

    http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html

Install Raspi-Sump
==================

The following will automatically install RPi.GPIO if it is not already
installed on your Pi.

    sudo pip install raspisump

This will copy all the files you need into /home/pi/raspi-sump


Navigate to /home/pi/raspi-sump/ and move the sample config file
to this directory.

    mv sample_config/raspisump.conf .

The /home/pi/raspi-sump folder is setup as follows on install;

* raspi-sump/sample_config/raspisump.conf (all configurations for raspisump).
* raspi-sump/csv (location of waterlevel readings to csv file)
* raspi-sump/charts (location of charts if using rsumpchart.py)
* raspi-sump/logs (location of rsumpmonitor.py logs if using raspisump as acontinuous process)


**Note take care with your raspisump.conf file if you are using Gmail or any other mail system that requires authentication.  Your username and password will be viewable in the file. You should change the default pi and root passwords on your RaspberryPi.


Edit raspisump.conf 
====================

All configurations are recorded in /home/pi/raspi-sump/raspisump.conf

See the configuration file for explanations of variables.


Hardware
========

Setup hardware (Please make sure you understand GPIO information on your pi).

You must use two resistors to create a voltage divider from the Sensor to the Pi.  There are various combinations of resistors that you can use, a google search for Voltage Divider Calculator will allow you to calculate which combination you can use to bring the voltage down from the echo pin to 3.3V.  I used a 470 Ohm and 1K Ohm resistor to bring the voltage down on the GPIO pin to 3.4 which is within a tolerable 5% level. I could have also use a 1K and 2K resistor to give me 3.333V. 

Four wires connected as follows from the sensor to the pi (note, this will require some soldering).  A floppy disk power connector fits nicely on the sensor. 

1-VCC pin to 5V pin on Pi (pin 2)

2-Ground pin to Ground on Pi (pin 6) 

3-Trig pin to GPIO

4-Echo pin to GPIO (need 470R resistor and 1K resistor to create a voltage divider.) In short, the 470 Ohm and 1K Ohm resistor are connected to one another with the Echo wire soldered between both of them to the GPIO pin.  The other end of the 1K resistor is then soldered to the Ground wire.

see http://www.linuxnorth.org/raspi-sump/ for information on pins I used.

Google soldering resistors for good information on how to do this if you have never done it.

Starting Raspi-Sump
===================
To start raspi-sump manually issue the command;

    sudo rsump.py

To run raspisump at 1 minute intervals enter the following line in crontab as follows;

1 - crontab -e

2 - enter line in crontab as follows;

    1 * * * * sudo /usr/local/bin/rsump.py

3 - Save crontab

(See cron documentation for questions on configuring crontab)


4) To monitor the log file in the csv folder while raspi-sump is running;

    tail -f 'csvlogfilename'

If running as a continuous process 
==================================

1) set reading_interval in raspisump.conf to desired interval in seconds (e.g.
reading_interval = 30). The default setting is 0 which will not run rsump.py as
a continuous process.

2) Add rsumpmonitor.py to crontab (see next section)

3) To start Raspi-Sump on bootup add the following line at the end of /etc/rc.local just before the line 'exit 0'

    /usr/local/bin/rsump.py &

5) Reboot your Raspberry Pi or run the following command.  Your pi will run
Raspi-Sump on boot from now on.

    sudo rsump.py &

Note*** Do not forget the ampersand '&' as this will run the script as a background process.

6) To stop Raspi-Sump:

    sudo killall 09 rsump.py

7) To monitor the log file in the csv folder while raspi-sump is running;

    tail -f 'csvlogfilename'

Health check with rsumpmonitor.py. If checking level more than once per minute only.
================================================================================

To check for the health of the rsump.py process run the rsumpmonitor.py script as
root. 
Add to pi user crontab as follows;

1 - crontab -e

2 - enter line in crontab as follows;

    5 * * * * sudo /usr/local/bin/rsumpmonitor.py

3 - Save crontab

This will check the rsump.py process every 5 minutes and restart it if it is stopped.


Making Line Charts of Sump Activity
===================================

You can make a daily chart of sump pump activity by using rsumpchart.py.

1 - From the command line run;

    rsumpchart.py


This will create a line chart of sump pump activity.  You can easily modify the file to save to a different location with another name.
Combined with a scheduled cron job it is an easy way to see the latest activity graphically.

**Note that this requires matplotlib and numpy on your RaspberryPi which can be
installed with the apt-get command.  See the Install Dependancies section at the
beginning of this file.

You can also use the move_file.sh script provided as an example of how you
transfer files offsite to a webserver or save historal chart information.
