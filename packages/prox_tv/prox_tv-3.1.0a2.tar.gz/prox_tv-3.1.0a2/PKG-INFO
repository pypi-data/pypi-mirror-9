Description: proxTV is a toolbox implementing blazing fast implementations of Total Variation proximity operators. While the core algorithms are implemented in C to achieve high efficiency, Matlab and Python interfaces are provided for ease of use. The library provides efficient solvers for a variety of Total Variation proximity problems, with address input signals of any dimensionality (1d, images, video, ...) and different norms to apply in the Total Variation term.
