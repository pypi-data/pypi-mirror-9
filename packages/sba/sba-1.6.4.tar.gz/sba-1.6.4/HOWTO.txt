To install this library, you will need to first install the sba library (libsba.so); then the sba projections library (libsbaprojs.so) before installing the Python wrapper using setup.py. 

1.  Obtain sba (current version 1.6) from::

    http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/sba

2.  You will need to alter the Makefile in order to build the library as a shared object.  Add the following lines to Makefile using a text editor:: 

libsba.so: 
	$(CC) -fPIC -c sba.h sba_levmar.c sba_levmar_wrap.c sba_lapack.c sba_crsm.c sba_chkjac.c
	$(CC) -shared -o libsba.so $(OBJS) -llapack -lblas

3.  Build the sba library as a shared object with the following command at the command prompt::

    make libsba.so

4.  This should result in a file libsba.so that provides the compiled shared object that can be called from Python.  As adminstrator, place libsba.so in /usr/local/lib, create a symbolic link for it, copy the header too, and update the shared library information:: 

    cp libsba.so /usr/local/lib/libsba.so.1.6.0
    chmod a-x /usr/local/lib/libsba.so.1.6.0
    ln -s /usr/local/lib/libsba.so.1.6.0 /usr/local/lib/libsba.so
    cp sba.h /usr/local/include
    ldconfig

5.  Next, obtain libsbaprojs::

hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/devangel77b/libsbaprojs

Install it by following the instructions provided with it.  You will run make to create libsbaprojs.so and then copy it, and the associated headers, into the same places you put libsba.so and sba.h.  

6.  After libsba and libsbaprojs are available, you can install the Python sba code using the following (as administrator or sudo): 

python setup.py --install
