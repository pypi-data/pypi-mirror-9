      "This tutorial shows you how to combine the various container types, in order to build data structures that can contain all of the data that you want to visualize or analyze, in an extremely flexible way.

HoloViews can store all of this data together, which will allow you to select just the right bit of data \"on the fly\" for any particular analysis or visualization, by indexing, slicing, selecting, and sampling in this data structure.\n",

The resulting data structures are complex, but they are composed of simple elements with well-defined interactions, making it feasible to express nearly any relationship that will characterize your data.  In practice, you will probably not need this many levels, but given this complete example, you should be able to construct an appropriate organization for whatever type of data that you do want to organize or visualize. \n",

But you cannot e.g. have an ``Overlay`` or ``HoloMap`` of ``Layout`` objects.  Confusingly, the objects may *act* as if you have these arrangements.  For instance, a ``Layout`` of ``HoloMap`` objects will be animated, like ``HoloMap`` objects, but only because of the extra dimension(s) provided by the enclosed ``HoloMap`` objects, not because the ``Layout`` itself has data along those dimensions.  Similarly, you cannot have a ``Layout`` of ``Layout`` objects, even though it looks like you can.  E.g. the ``+`` operator on two ``Layout`` objects will not create a ``Layout`` of ``Layout`` objects; it just creates a new ``Layout`` object containing the data from both of the other objects.  Similarly for the ``Overlay`` of ``Overlay`` objects using ``*``; only a single combined ``Overlay`` is returned.\n",
