Description: =======================================================================
        The 1st Competition on Counter Measures to Finger Vein Spoofing Attacks
        =======================================================================
        
        This package provides the source code to run the experiments published in the paper `The 1st Competition on Counter Measures to Finger Vein Spoofing Attacks <http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/>`_.
        It relies on some satellite packages from Bob_ to compute the evaluation. 
        
        .. note::
          Currently, this package only works in Unix-like environments and under MacOS.
          Due to limitations of the Bob_ library, MS Windows operating systems are not supported.
          We are working on a port of Bob_ for MS Windows, but it might take a while.
          In the meanwhile you could use our VirtualBox_ images that can be downloaded `here <http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob/images>`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        The installation of this package relies on the `BuildOut <http://www.buildout.org>`_ system. By default, the command line sequence::
        
          $ ./python bootstrap.py
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        There are a few exceptions, which are not automatically downloaded:
        
        Bob
        ---
        To install Bob_, please visit http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob and follow the installation instructions.
        Please verify that you have at least version 2.0 of Bob installed.
        If you have installed Bob in a non-standard directory, please open the buildout.cfg file from the base directory and set the ``prefixes`` directory accordingly.
        
        .. note::
          The experiments that we report in the Paper_ were generated with Bob_ version 2.0.
          If you use different versions of either of these packages, the results might differ slightly.
          For example, we are aware that, due to some initialization differences, the results using Bob 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 are not identical, but similar.
        
        
        Image Databases
        ---------------
        The experiments are run on external image database.
        We do not provide the images from the database itselve.
        Hence, please contact the database owners to obtain a copy of the images.
        The database used in the competition can be downloaded here:
        
        - Spoofing-Attack Finger Vein Database [``fvspoofingattack``]: http://www.idiap.ch/dataset/fvspoofingattack
        
        .. note::
          After downloading the databases, you will need to tell our software, where it can find them by changing the **run_icb2015_competition.sh** file.
          In particular, please update the ``PATHDATABASE`` to indicate the directory of the dataset: PATHDATABASE="YOUR_PATH/FVspoofingAttack".
        
        
        Please let all other configuration parameters unchanged as this might influence the competition analysis and, hence, the reproducibility of the results.
        
        Getting help
        ------------
        In case anything goes wrong, please feel free to open a new ticket in our GitLab_ page, or send an email to pedro.tome@idiap.ch.
        
        
        Recreating the results of the Paper_
        ====================================
        
        After successfully setting up the databases, you are now able to run the anti-spoofing finger vein evaluation as explained in the Paper_.
        
        Running the experiments
        -----------------------
        The competition results are run using the **run_icb2015_competition.sh** file.
        
        Additionally, the individual scripts used can be found in ``bin/`` directory.
        See ``./bin/icb2015_baseline_countermeasure.py --help`` and ``./bin/icb2015_evaluation_results.py --help`` for a complete list of options.
        
        1. Run the competition results on the Spoofing-Attack Finger Vein database::
        
            $ ./run_icb2015_competition.sh
        
        .. note::
          All output directories of the scripts will be automatically generated if they do not exist yet.
          The submissions folder contains the score files submitted to the competition.
