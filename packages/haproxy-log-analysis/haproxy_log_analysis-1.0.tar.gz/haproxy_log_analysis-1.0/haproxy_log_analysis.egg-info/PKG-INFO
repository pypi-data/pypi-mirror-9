Description: HAProxy log analyzer
        ====================
        
        This Python package is a `HAProxy`_ log parser that allows you to analyze
        your HAProxy log files in multiple ways (see commands section below).
        
        .. note::
           Currently only the `HTTP log format`_ is supported.
        
        
        Tests and coverage
        ------------------
        
        No project is trustworthy if does not have tests and a decent coverage!

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        See the `documentation and API`_ at ReadTheDocs_.
        
        
        Command-line interface
        ----------------------
        
        The current ``--help`` looks like this::
        
          usage: haproxy_log_analysis [-h] [-l LOG] [-s START] [-d DELTA] [-c COMMAND]
                                      [-f FILTER] [-n] [--list-commands]
                                      [--list-filters]
        
          Analyze HAProxy log files and outputs statistics about it
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            -l LOG, --log LOG     HAProxy log file to analyze
            -s START, --start START
                                  Process log entries starting at this time, in HAProxy
                                  date format (e.g. 11/Dec/2013 or
                                  11/Dec/2013:19:31:41). At least provide the
                                  day/month/year. Values not specified will use their
                                  base value (e.g. 00 for hour). Use in conjunction with
                                  -d to limit the number of entries to process.
            -d DELTA, --delta DELTA
                                  Limit the number of entries to process. Express the
                                  time delta as a number and a time unit, e.g.: 1s, 10m,
                                  3h or 4d (for 1 second, 10 minutes, 3 hours or 4
                                  days). Use in conjunction with -s to only analyze
                                  certain time delta. If no start time is given, the
                                  time on the first line will be used instead.
            -c COMMAND, --command COMMAND
                                  List of commands, comma separated, to run on the log
                                  file. See -l to get a full list of them.
            -f FILTER, --filter FILTER
                                  List of filters to apply on the log file. Passed as
                                  comma separated and parameters within square brackets,
                                  e.g ip[192.168.1.1],ssl,path[/some/path]. See --list-
                                  filters to get a full list of them.
            -n, --negate-filter   Make filters passed with -f work the other way around,
                                    i.e. ifthe ``ssl`` filter is passed instead of showing
                                  only ssl requests it will show non-ssl traffic. If the
                                  ``ip`` filter isused, then all but that ip passed to
                                  the filter will be used.
            --list-commands       Lists all commands available.
            --list-filters        Lists all filters available.
        
        
        Commands
        --------
        
        Commands are small purpose specific programs in itself that report specific
        statistics about the log file being analyzed. See the ``--help`` (or the
        section above) to know how to run them.
        
        ``counter``
          Reports how many log lines could be parsed.
        
        ``counter_invalid``
          Reports how many log lines could *not* be parsed.
        
        ``http_methods``
          Reports a breakdown of how many requests have been made per HTTP method
          (GET, POST...)
        
        ``ip_counter``
          Reports a breakdown of how many requests have been made per IP. Note that
          for this to work you need to configure HAProxy to capture the header that
          has the ip on it (usually the X-Forwarded-For header). Something like:
          ``capture request header X-Forwarded-For len 20``
        
        ``top_ips``
          Reports the 10 IPs with most requests (and the amount of requests).
        
        ``status_codes_counter``
          Reports a breakdown of how many requests per HTTP status code (404, 500,
          200, 301..) are on the log file.
        
        ``request_path_counter``
          Reports a breakdown of how many requests per path (/rss, /, /another/path).
        
        ``top_request_paths``
          Reports the 10 paths with most requests.
        
        ``slow_requests``
          Reports a list of requests that downstream servers took more than 1 second
          to response.
        
        ``counter_slow_requests``
          Reports the amount of requests that downstream servers took more than 1
          second to response.
        
        ``average_response_time``
          Reports the average time (in milliseconds) servers spend to answer requests.
          .. note:: Aborted requests are not considered.
        
        ``average_waiting_time``
          Reports the average time (in milliseconds) requests spend waiting on the
          various HAProxy queues.
        
        ``server_load``
          Reports a breakdown of how many requests were processed by each downstream
          server. Note that currently it does not take into account the backend the
          server is configured on.
        
        ``queue_peaks``
          Reports a list of queue peaks. A queue peak is defined by the biggest
          value on the backend queue on a series of log lines that are between log
          lines without being queued.
        
        ``connection_type``
          Reports on how many requests were made on SSL and how many on plain HTTP.
          This command only works if the default port for SSL (443) appears on the
          path.
        
        ``requests_per_minute``
          Reports on how many requests were made per minute. It works best when used
          with ``-s`` and ``-d`` command line arguments, as the output can be huge.
        
        ``print``
          Prints the raw lines. This can be useful to trim down a file (with ``-s`` and
          ``-d`` for example) so that later runs are faster.
        
        
        Filters
        -------
        
        Filters, contrary to commands, are a way to reduce the amount of log lines
        to be processed.
        
        .. note::
           The ``-n`` command line argument allows to reverse filters output.
        
        This helps when looking for specific traces, like a certain IP, a path...
        
        ``ip``
          Filters log lines by the given IP.
        
        ``ip_range``
          Filters log lines by the given IP range (all IPs that begin with the same
          prefix).
        
        ``path``
          Filters log lines by the given string.
        
        ``ssl``
          Filters log lines that are from SSL connections. See
          :method::`.HaproxyLogLine.is_https` for its limitations.
        
        ``slow_requests``
          Filters log lines that take at least the given time to get answered (in
          milliseconds).
        
        ``time_frame``
          This is an implicit filter that is used when ``--start``, and optionally,
          ``--delta`` are used. Do not type this filter on the command line, use
          ``--start`` and ``--delta``.
        
        ``status_code``
          Filters log lines that match the given HTTP status code (i.e. 404, 200...).
        
        ``status_code_family``
          Filters log lines that match the given HTTP status code family (i.e. 4 for
          all 4xx status codes, 5 for 5xx status codes...).
        
        ``http_method``
          Filters log lines by the HTTP method used (GET, POST...).
        
        ``backend``
          Filters log lines by the HAProxy backend the connection was handled with.
        
        ``frontend``
          Filters log lines by the HAProxy frontend the connection arrived from.
        
        ``server``
          Filters log lines by the downstream server that handled the connection.
        
        ``response_size``
          Filters log lines by the response size (in bytes). Specially useful when
          looking for big file downloads.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        After installation you will have a console script `haproxy_log_analysis`::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        - add more commands: *(help appreciated)*
        
          - reports on servers connection time
          - reports on termination state
          - reports around connections (active, frontend, backend, server)
          - *your ideas here*
        
        - think of a way to show the commands output in a meaningful way
        
        - be able to specify an output format. For any command that makes sense (slow
          requests for example) output the given fields for each log line (i.e.
          acceptance date, path, downstream server, load at that time...)
        
        - *your ideas*

        1.0 (2015-03-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix issue #9.
          log line on the syslog part was too strict,
          it was expecting the hostname to be a string and was
          failing if it was an IP.
          [GF]
        
        0.0.3.post2 (2015-01-05)
        ------------------------
        
        - Finally really fixed issue #7.
          ``namespace_packages`` was not meant to be on setup.py at all.
          Silly copy&paste mistake.
          [GF]

        - Pickle :class::`.HaproxyLogFile` data for faster performance.
          [GF]
        
        - Add a way to negate the filters, so that instead of being able to filter by
          IP, it can output all but that IP information.
          [GF]
        
        - Add lots of filters: ip, path, ssl, backend, frontend, server, status_code
          and so on. See ``--list-filters`` for a complete list of them.
          [GF]
        
        - Add :method::`.HaproxyLogFile.parse_data` method to get data from data stream.
          It allows you use it as a library.

        - Add ``--list-filters`` argument on the command line interface.
          [GF]
        
        - Add ``--filter`` argument on the command line interface, inspired by
          Bogdan's early design.
          [bogdangi] [GF]
        
        - Create a new module :module::`haproxy.filters` that holds all available filters.
          [GF]
        
        - Improve :method::`.HaproxyLogFile.cmd_queue_peaks` output to not only show
          peaks but also when requests started to queue and when they finsihed and
          the amount of requests that had been queued.
          [GF]
        
        - Show help when no argument is given.
          [GF]
        
        - Polish documentation and docstrings here and there.

        - Create a ``console_script`` `haproxy_log_analysis` for ease of use.
          [bogdangi]
        
        - Add Sphinx documentation system, still empty.
          [GF]
        
        - Keep valid log lines sorted so that the exact order of connections is kept.
          [GF]
        
        - Add quite a few commands, see `README.rst`_ for a complete list of them.
          [GF]
        
        - Run commands passed as arguments (with -c flag).
          [GF]
        
        - Add a requirements.txt file to keep track of dependencies and pin them.
          [GF]
        
        - Add travis_ and coveralls_ support. See its badges on `README.rst`_.
          [GF]
        
        - Add argument parsing and custom validation logic for all arguments.
          [GF]
        
        - Add regular expressions for haproxy log lines (HTTP format) and to
          parse HTTP requests path.
          Added tests to ensure they work as expected.
