"""
Render markdown syntax wikitext to HTML using the
Python Markdown library.

If 'markdown.wiki_link_base' is set in config, then
TiddlyWeb oriented features are turned on (see below),
otherwise the text is treated as straight Markdown.

By default HTML in user input is escaped. If different behavior
is desired set `markdown.safe_mode` in config to one of the values
described in the [Python-Markdown
documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/reference.html#safe_mode):
"replace", "escape", "remove" of `False`.

By default some extensions are included:

fenced_code: http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/fenced_code_blocks.html
def_list: http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/definition_lists.html
foootnotes: http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/footnotes.html
headerid: http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/header_id.html

The TiddlyWeb features add the following:

wikilinks: CamelCase
freelinks: [[some page]]
labeled freelinks: [[label|some page]]
transclusion: see below

Wikilinks and freelinks will be prefixed by `markdown.wiki_link_base`.
Set it to '' to activate WikiLinks without any prefix (this is probably
the best choice, it results in links relative to the current tiddler).

Transclusion uses the following syntax:

    {{tiddler title}}

That will include tiddler with the given title from the
current context (recipe or bag) of the transcluding tiddler.

Links and transclusion can be augmented with @target syntax:

    @target
    CamelCase@target
    [[some page]]@target
    [[label|some page]]@target
    {{tiddler title}}@target

`target` is resolved via three different configuration settings:

* `markdown.interlinker` names a function which returns a link
   to whatever might be considered a target of some kind. It's
   arguments are a WSGI environ and a string representing the
   target. It returns a URI for the target, without the title
   of the tiddler.

* `markdown.target_resolver` names a function which determinesh
   the tiddler object that is to be transcluded. It's arguments
   are a WSGI environ, a string representing the context from
   which a tiddler is being transcluded and a tiddler object.
   That tiddler object is modified in place to add the bag in
   which it can be found.

* `markdown.transclude_url` names a function which returns a
   link to a tiddler in a target context. It's arguments are a
   WSGI environ and a tiddler. It returns a URI for the tiddler
   that has been transcluded. This is useful for augmenting the
   output to include a link to the transcluded tiddler.

If the desired target contains spaces, wrap the target in [[ ]], for
example:

    [[my page]]@[[my bag]]

To use this renderer on Tiddlers which have a type of
'text/x-markdown' adjust tiddlywebconfig.py to include:

 'wikitext.type_render_map' :{
     'text/x-markdown': 'tiddlywebplugins.markdown'
     }

If you want all tiddlers that have no type set to be rendered
as markdown, then configure:

 'wikitext.default_renderer': 'tiddlywebplugins.markdown'
