Description: LDAP control panel for Plone
        ============================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        plone.app.ldap provides a user interface in a Plone site to manage
        LDAP and Active Directory servers. 
        
        This package succeeds the simplon.plone.ldap package.
        
        It builds on the functionality provided by LDAPMultiPlugins_, LDAPUserFolder_
        and PloneLDAP_.
        
        
        Active Directory
        ----------------
        
        Active Directory provides an LDAP interface to its data. Using this interface
        Plone can use both users and groups from an Active Directory system. Writing
        to Active Directory is not supported.
        
        With Active Directory you can use two different properties as login name:
        `userPrincipalName` and `sAMAccountName`. `sAMAccountName` is the plain account
        name without any domain information and is only unique within a single domain.
        If your environment only uses a single AD domain this option is the best
        choice. For environments with multiple names the `userPrincipalName` attribute
        can be used since this includes both account name and domain information.
        
        
        Since Plone does not support binary user ids it is not possible to use the
        `objectGUID` attribute as user ids. Instead you can use either `sAMAccountName`
        or `userPrincipalName`. The same criteria for choosing a login name also
        apply to selecting the user id attribute.
        
        Standard LDAP
        -------------
        
        LDAP directory servers are fully supported. LDAP users and groups are usable
        as standard Plone users and groups can be me managed normally. Creating and
        deleting users and groups is supported.
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        This package works with Plone 3 and Plone 4. Plone 3 and Plone 4.0
        users should install a version in the 1.2.* series
        (e.g. plone.app.ldap < 1.3, the latest current release is 1.2.9), as
        release 1.3 will only work with Plone 4.1 or higher.
        
        This package depends on ``python-ldap``. In order to build it correctly you
        need to have some development libraries included in your system. On a typical
        Debian-based installation use::
        
            sudo apt-get install python-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev
        
        Once the package is installed, it will be available as an add-on named
        "LDAP support", and this add-on can be activated in a Plone instance
        using the Add-ons section of the Plone Control Panel. Be careful, as this
        package also currently installs LDAPUserFolder as a dependency, which makes
        the add-on "LDAPUserFolder CMF Tools" available. Do not install this add-on!
        It will replace the portal_membership tool and make your Plone site
        unusable.
        
        Install without buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        First you need to install this package in the python path for your
        Zope instance. This can be done by installing it in either your system
        path packages (usually with ``pip`` or ``easy_install``) or in the
        lib/python directory in your Zope instance.
        
        After installing the package it needs to be registered in your Zope instance.
        This can be done by putting a plone.app.ldap-configure.zcml file in the
        etc/pakage-includes directory with this content::
        
          <include package="plone.app.ldap" />
        
        or, alternatively, you can add that line to the configure.zcml in a
        package or Product that is already registered.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing plone.app.ldap 
        is even simpler. You can install it by adding it to the eggs line for your 
        zope instance::
        
          [instance]
          eggs =
              ...
              plone.app.ldap
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Installing the development version
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To specify the current development version you may use::
        
          [buildout]
          find-links =
              ...
              http://github.com/plone/plone.app.ldap/tarball/master#egg=plone.app.ldap-dev
        
          [instance]
          eggs =
              ...
             plone.app.ldap==dev
        
        With ``pip`` that would be this::
        
          pip install -f http://github.com/plone/plone.app.ldap/tarball/master#egg=plone.app.ldap-dev plone.app.ldap==dev
        
        With ``easy_install``::
        
          easy_install -f http://github.com/plone/plone.app.ldap/tarball/master#egg=plone.app.ldap-dev plone.app.ldap==dev

          [kteague]
        
        - Ability to import/export an LDAP configuration using generic setup.
          This feature is the same as the one provided by collective.genericsetup.ldap
          and exports made with that product can be imported into plone.app.ldap.
          During import all existing servers, general settings and schema
          will be overwritten from config file - but no interfaces or cache
          settings are changed.

        - Added a tab for display and modifying the cache settings.
          [kteague]
        
        - Send out notification events for all object additions/modifications/removals
          so that configuration always gets propogated to the LDAPUserFolder object.
          [kteague]
        
        - Changed the base class for LDAPConfiguration so that it gets properly
          rooted in the site (otherwise LDAPConfiguration.__parent__ goes into
          an infinite loop, pointing to a fresh PersistenComponents instance who's
          parent is in turn LDAPConfiguration).
          [kteague]
        
        - Updated the HTML to wrap all control panel forms in a form tag so that
          tabs are properly displayed in Plone 4.
          [kteague]
        
        - Fixed i18n domain changes from Vincent. The message factory was defined in
          the wrong ``__init__.py``.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed i18n domain from plone to plone.app.ldap.
          Registered locales directory.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.1 (2008-08-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix ldap schema config for Active Directory
          [elro]
        
        
        simplon.plone.ldap - 1.0
        ------------------------
        
        - Initial package structure.
