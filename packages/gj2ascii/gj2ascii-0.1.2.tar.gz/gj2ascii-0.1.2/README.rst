Render GeoJSON as ASCII on the commandline.

Needs a better name.

Examples
========

By default every geometry is rendered individually and the user paginates through
them by pressing return:

Use the ``--all`` flag to render the entire layer:

Caveats
=======

The aspect ration of a character on the commandline is not equal so there is some
vertical distortion.

Relies on [Fiona](http://toblerity.org/fiona/) for reading vector data, so
reading delimited JSON or JSON from a file or ``stdin`` is not yet supported.  It
would be extra slick if this could take the output from ``fio cat``.
