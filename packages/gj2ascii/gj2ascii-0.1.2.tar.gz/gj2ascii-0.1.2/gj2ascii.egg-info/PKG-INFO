        ========
        
        Render GeoJSON as ASCII on the commandline.
        
        Inspired by `Twitter <https://twitter.com/vtcraghead/status/575370039701929984>`__, vtcraghead, and dnomadb.
        Needs a better name.

        Examples
        ========
        
        By default every geometry is rendered individually and the user paginates through
        them by pressing return:

           :target: https://github.com/geowurster/gj2ascii
        
        Use the ``--all`` flag to render the entire layer:

        Caveats
        =======
        
        The aspect ration of a character on the commandline is not equal so there is some
        vertical distortion.
        
        Relies on [Fiona](http://toblerity.org/fiona/) for reading vector data, so
        reading delimited JSON or JSON from a file or ``stdin`` is not yet supported.  It
        would be extra slick if this could take the output from ``fio cat``.
        
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        Via pip:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            pip install gj2ascii
        
        
        Developing
        ==========
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/geowurster/gj2ascii.git
            $ cd gj2ascii
            $ virtualenv venv
            $ source venv/bin/activate
            $ pip install -e .
