rsttst makes your reStructuredText documentation testable.

In fact, this README file is testable and is used to test rsttst.

Below is an example:

2 + 2 = 4
=========

The title "2 + 2 = 4" becomes the test name after being converted to a
Python friendly identifier (ie. 2_plus_2_equals_4).

The bash code in the below code block will be run...

.. code-block:: bash

   echo '2 + 2' | bc

...and the resulting stdout will be compared to the following code block:

.. code-block:: bash

   4

The test fails if stdout doesn't match the block above.

Dotted notation
===============

Sometimes you want to be flexible with the output you accept.

You can use "." and the ":class: dotted" rst directive option to support this.

.. code-block:: bash

   echo Date: $(date)
   echo '\ok'

The below code block uses the ":class: dotted" option.

.. code-block:: bash
   :class: dotted

   Date: ............................
   \ok

Three dots match in a similiar way to what you'd expect for a regex pattern of ".+" to work:

.. code-block:: bash

   echo '<NZ>'
   echo $(date "+DATE: %Y-%m-%d%nTIME: %H:%M:%S")

The below code block uses the ":class: dotted" option.

.. code-block:: bash
   :class: dotted

   <...>
   DATE: ... TIME: ...

Generating tests
================

Under the hood rsttst generates Python code which is executable with py.test.
Here's how we generate the Python test code:

.. code-block:: bash

   rsttst README.rst
   cat test_readme.py | head -n 28

The resulting test code looks like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
   from rsttst.core import run, Dotted
   
   def test_2_plus_2_equals_4():
       output = run(u"""echo '2 + 2' | bc""")
       assert output == u"""4"""
   
   def test_dotted_notation():
       output = run(u"""echo Date: $(date)
   echo '\\ok'""")
       expected = Dotted(u"""Date: ............................
   \\ok""")
       cmp(output, expected)
       expected = u"{0}".format(expected)
       assert output == expected
   
   def test_dotted_notation__2():
       output = run(u"""echo '<NZ>'
   echo $(date "+DATE: %Y-%m-%d%nTIME: %H:%M:%S")""")
       expected = Dotted(u"""<...>
   DATE: ... TIME: ...""")
       cmp(output, expected)
       expected = u"{0}".format(expected)
       assert output == expected
   
   def test_generating_tests():
       output = run(u"""rsttst README.rst
   cat test_readme.py | head -n 28""")

Windows new lines
=================

^M characters are automatically removed.

.. code-block:: bash

   printf 'supports\012\015windows new lines'

.. code-block:: bash

   supports
   windows new lines

Ignore code-blocks
==================

Sometimes you want to use a code-block without it being tested by rsttst.

You can use the ":class: ignore" directive to ignore this code-block:

.. code-block:: bash
   :class: ignore

   .. code-block:: bash
      :class: ignore

Running the tests
=================

You could probably use another test runner, but pytest works quite well:

.. code-block:: bash

   py.test -k 'not test_running_the_tests' | grep -v seconds

Note: we had to exclude 'test_running_the_tests', otherwise it's turtles all the way down.

.. code-block:: bash
   :class: dotted

   ============================= test session starts ==============================
   platform ...
   collected 6 items
           
   test_readme.py .....
           
   ============= 1 tests deselected by '-knot test_running_the_tests' =============


Functionality
=============

Right now rsttst only supports bash testing.

FAQ
===

*Why does pytest throw an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception for my JSON tests?*

Please upgrade to the latest version of pytest
