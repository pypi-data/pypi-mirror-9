Description: OPAL
        ====
        
        [Project Website](http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk)
        
        OPAL is designed to make writing transactional digital services for a clnical environment easy.
        
        It builds on established Open Source technologies with a track record of helping developers
        build easy to maintain, robust applications.
        
        Most notably, it makes use of [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) 
        and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
        
        From there, OPAL provides you with a common batteries-included architecture for writing healthcare
        applications, and a composable modular framework that takes advantage of generic, re-usable components.
        
        OPAL is an entirely Open ([Source](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal) & 
        [Governance](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal)issues) as are the wide library of plugins.
        
        OPAL was created by [Open Health Care UK](http://openhealthcare.org.uk), because it makes Healthcare IT Less Bad.
        
        We'd love you to get involved by using what we make, reporting bugs/suggesting improvements, and fixing bugs/making improvements.  Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING file.
