Pure Python OPC-UA Client (and maybe server later)

API is or will be the same as the python bindings of freeopcua c++ client

Most code is autogenerated from xml specification using same code as the one that is goind to be used for freeopcua C++ client and server

what works:
* connection to server, opening channel, session
* browsing and reading attributes value
* gettings nodes by path and nodeids
* creating subscriptions
* subscribing to items for data change

what is not implemented yet (but is trivial to implement):
* subscribing to events
* subscribing to status change
* adding all modify methods

what is not implemented or though about but should also be trivial
* certificate handling
* user and password 

in addition testing against more servers should be done

adding more functionnality shoud be trivial since most code is autogenerated
