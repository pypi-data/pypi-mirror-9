Description: # dot3k
        
        ## Hardware Requirements
        
        You'll need to enable spi.
        
        ```bash
        sudo raspi-config
        ```
        
        Then head into `Advanced Options -> SPI -> Yes`.
        
        And i2c.
        
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
        ```
        
        And comment out (place a `#` before):
        
        ```
        blacklist i2c-bcm2708
        ```
        
        And also:
        
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/modules
        ```
        
        Add the line:
           
        ```
        i2c-dev
        ```
        
        Reboot to make these changes take effect:
        
        ```bash
        sudo reboot
        ```
        
        ## Software Requirements
        
        Next you should install python-smbus and python-dev via apt:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install python-smbus python-dev
        ```
        
        And pip, if you don't have it:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install python-pip
        ```
        
        Then install st7036 and sn3218 using pip:
        
        ```bash
        sudo pip install st7036 sn3218
        ```
        
        You can run the `requirements.sh` file to do this for you!
