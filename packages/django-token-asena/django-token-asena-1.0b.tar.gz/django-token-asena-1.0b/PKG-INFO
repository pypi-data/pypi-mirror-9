        Django Token Asena
        ==================
        
        Another Token App?
        ==================
        
        Yes, and no. I was looking for an app that would generate a random string of
        text for a user, so that a user can view restircted information on a site
        without needing a session linked to his username. What I found on PyPI was
        good, but not what I needed for a few reasons.
        
        - The app usually was REST-based, meaning it was more for request
          authentication an not for session authentication.
        
        - The app relied to heavily on Django's authenticatino system. While that
          potentially could work the problem here is that if you log out of the user
          account, the token session dies with it.
        
        Thus, I have **Django Token Asena**, the app that can provide
        session-independent tokens. You can even generate *sets* of tokens. With each
        token and with each token set you can set a token expiration and a token
        timeout.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        As with most apps, the easiest way is through PIP::
        
            pip install -U django-token-asena
        
        Add ``asena`` to your list of ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                # ...
                'asena',
                # ...
            )

        Other Notes
        ===========
        
        Failed Tests
        ------------
        
        Some of the unit tests do fail, mainly ``test_get_time_remaining``
         and (consequently) ``test_get_session_dict`` (both from the
         ``asena.tests.test_models.TestToken.`` test case). This is because there is a
         clock cycle delay between the expected time and the result time, so the
         values are usually off by a second even if the test would normally pass. I'll
         work on a fix for this in the future.
