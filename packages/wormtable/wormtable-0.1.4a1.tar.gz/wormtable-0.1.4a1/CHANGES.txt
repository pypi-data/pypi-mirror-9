v0.1.2, 2014.11

    * Fixed file permission bug and confusing error message.

v0.1.1, 2014.08

    * Fixed index cache size bug in wtadmin.
    
v0.1.0, 2013.11

    * Fixed index.max_key() bug.

    * This release marks the point at which we try very hard not to 
      break backwards and forwards compatibility.

v0.1.0b5, 2013.11 

    * Changed the API so that missing values are always returned as None. 
      This required a minor change in the index file format; indexes from 
      previous releases must be rebuilt.

v0.1.0b4, 2013.08 
	
    * Changed index key format so that values can be reconstructed from keys
      and all types of column sort correctly.

    * Added address_size attribute to schema XML format for full forwards and 
      backwards compatibility with large rows.

v0.1.0b3, 2013.08 
	
    * Minor change in row format for forward compatability with large rows
      and columns.

v0.1.0b2, 2013.08 
    
    * This release is not backwards compatible with 0.1.0b1. Several changes
      were made which broke compatibility in the storage formats, and the 
      API also changed in significant ways. Hopefully this will be the last
      time this needs to happen.
    
    * Added support for half-precision floats based on NumPy's halffloat.[c,h].

v0.1.0b1, 2013.07 -- Initial release
