        Piano. Beginner friendly Plone development.
        
        .. warning:: This is very much ALPHA!. In the spirit of release early, here it is.
        
        Installation
        =================
        
        Quick Install
        -----------------------
        
        To install `piano` quickly, run the following commands::
        
            wget -qO- goo.gl/NmFSel | bash
            source ~/.bashrc
        
        This will use `pipsi` to install the relevant packages in user space.
        It also ensures that piano is using the most up-t-date version of
        setuptools.
        
        Longer Install
        -------------------
        
        We prefer and recommend `pipsi`. 
        (Here are installation instructions for pipsi https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi#readme.)
        
        Once you have pipsi run::
        
            pipsi install for-beginner-piano
            ~/.local/venvs/for-beginner-piano/bin/pip install -U setuptools
        
        .. note:: It is important to ensure that the latest version of setuptools is installed
                  for this reason we run the second command above.
        
        Usage
        =============
        
        To create a new Plone buildout project
        ------------------------------------------
        
        Use the subcommand `newbuildout` to create a buildout project.
        
        For example, if your project will be called `my-plone-site`::
        
            piano newbuildout my-plone-site
            
        .. note: A buildout is a folder which holds all the settings required to build
        and deploy a Plone site
        
        You'll see output similar to this::
        
            Creating virtualenv... (my-plone-site)
            Installing Buildout...
            Downloading installer (https://launchpad.net/plone/4.3/4.3.3/+download/Plone-4.3.3-UnifiedInstaller.tgz)
            Unpacking installer...
            Unpacking cache...
            Installing eggs...
            Installing cmmi & dist...
            Configuring cache...
            Running Buildout...
        
         
        Creating a Plone add-on
        -------------------------
        ::
        
            piano newaddon myaddon
            
        (coming soon, this command doesn't work yet)
