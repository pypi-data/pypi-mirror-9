        Piano. Beginner friendly Plone development.
        
        .. warning:: This is very much ALPHA!. In the spirit of release early, here it is.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        You should have the build tools and Plone dependencies installed.
        
        If you're on Debian or Ubuntu with sudo privileges, We've simplified this for you.
        Just run one of the commands below:
        
        For Debian::
        
            wget -qO- for-beginner-piano.github.io/debian | bash
        
        For Ubuntu::
        
            wget -qO- for-beginner-piano.github.io/ubuntu | bash
        
        
        Quick Install
        -------------
        
        To install `piano` quickly, run the following commands:
        
        ::
        
            wget -qO- for-beginner-piano.github.io | bash
            source ~/.bashrc
        
        This will use `pipsi` to install the relevant packages in user space.
        It also ensures that piano is using the most up-to-date version of
        setuptools.
        
        Longer Install
        --------------
        
        We prefer and recommend `pipsi`. 
        
        Once you have pipsi, run:
        
        ::
        
            pipsi install for-beginner-piano
            ~/.local/venvs/for-beginner-piano/bin/pip install -U setuptools
        
        .. note:: It is important to ensure that the latest version of setuptools is installed
                  for this reason we run the second command above.
        
        Installing non default versions
        ===============================
        Future version of piano will simplify the approach to installing non default
        versions of Plone, for now piano requires that you explicitly set special
        environment variables. 
        
        For example to install Plone 5 you would do the following::
        
            export PIANO_EXTENDS=https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/master/plone-5-0
            export PIANO_UNIFIEDINSTALLER_URL=https://launchpad.net/plone/5.0/5.0a2/+download/Plone-5.0a2-UnifiedInstaller.tgz
            export PIANO_UNIFIEDINSTALLER_DIR=Plone-5.0a2-UnifiedInstaller
        
        then run::
        
            piano newbuildout myplone5
            
        Usage
        =====
        
        To create a new Plone buildout project
        --------------------------------------
        
        Use the subcommand `newbuildout` to create a buildout project.
        
        For example, if your project will be called `my-plone-site`:
        
        ::
        
            piano newbuildout my-plone-site
            
        .. note:: A buildout is a folder which holds all the settings required to build
                  and deploy a Plone site
        
        You'll see output similar to this:
        
        ::
        
            Creating virtualenv... (my-plone-site)
            Installing Buildout...
            Downloading installer (https://launchpad.net/plone/4.3/4.3.3/+download/Plone-4.3.3-UnifiedInstaller.tgz)
            Unpacking installer...
            Unpacking cache...
            Installing eggs...
            Installing cmmi & dist...
            Configuring cache...
            Running Buildout...
        
         
        Creating a Plone add-on
        -----------------------
        
        This is not working yet, but:
        
        ::
        
            piano newaddon myaddon
            
        (coming soon, this command doesn't work yet)
