Description: TailorDev CMS
        =============
        
        A simple CMS for your django projects.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        For now, Django>=1.5 is required for this project to run on production,
        with python>=2.6. Currently, this application is not compatible with
        python 3.3. We are working on it.
        
        This CMS is a simple application that generously takes advantage of the
        following django packages:
        
        -  django-grappelli: sexy admin rendering with TinyMCE rich text editor
           (this should not be a dependency for further releases)
        -  django-reversion: track article edition history
        -  django-modeltranslation: articles internationalization
        -  django-mptt: article categories hierarchy
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install TailorDev CMS, use pip:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install django-tailordev-cms
        
        If you intend to test or improve this application, first clone this
        repository and install the local dependencies:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt
        
        Add ``td_cms`` and its dependencies to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:
        
        ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
                # CMS
                'grappelli',
                'reversion',
                'modeltranslation',
                'mptt',
                'td_cms',
            ...
            )
        
        Add ``td_cms`` urls to your project url patterns:
        
        ::
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                ...
                url(r'', include('td_cms.urls')),  # should be last
            )
        
            Note due to default url patterns ``/category-slug/page-slug/``, we
            strongly recommand to include td\_cms url patterns after all other
            patterns.
        
        And then update your database:
        
        ::
        
            $ python manage.py syncdb
            $ python manage.py migrate
        
        Create the filemanager upload directory (replace the {{ MEDIA\_ROOT }}
        by your setting value):
        
        ::
        
            $ mkdir -p {{ MEDIA_ROOT }}/uploads/images/pages
        
        Templates
        ---------
        
        Create a base template to inherit from. It should be visible as
        ``_layouts/base.html``
        
        NB: to load td\_cms styles, ensure your base template has a ``css``
        block.
        
        Running the Tests
        -----------------
        
        You can run the tests with via:
        
        ::
        
            $ python setup.py test
        
        or:
        
        ::
        
            $ python runtests.py
