Description: Argpext provides methods to quickly expose any required callable
        objects, such as function, or generator, to a 
        DOS/Linux command line hereby defining a task.
        
        Argpext provides method to organize multiple tasks conveniently into a tree structure.
        
        Each task of such tree can then be executed by passing the proper sequence
        of command line arguments that is necessary to identify the task to
        be executed; the remaining arguments, if any, specify the values of the arguments
        argument passed to the task (if any). 
        
        Help messages, which are mostly based on the docstrings, are
        automatically produced when the --help (or -h) flag is passed.
        
        The return values of the functions and the values yielded by the
        generators are treated differently.  Full-featured return value
        objects are available at the point of execution in
        Python. Customizable return value display option is available for
        execution under Linux/DOS command prompt.
        
        A thorough documentation (with numerous examples) is provided at the link above.
