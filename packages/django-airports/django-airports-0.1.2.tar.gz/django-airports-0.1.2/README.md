### Requirements

You must have *django-cities* installed and configured, see the [django-cities documentation](https://github.com/coderholic/django-cities) for details and setup instructions.

### Setup

Either clone this repository into your project, or install with ```pip install django-airports```

You'll need to add ```airports``` to ```INSTALLED_APPS``` in your project's ```settings.py``` file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'airports',
)
```

Then run ```./manage.py syncdb``` to create the required database tables, and ```./manage.py airports``` to import all of the airports data. **NOTE:** This can take some time.

Please see ``example`` application. This application is used to manually test the functionalities of this package. This also serves as a good example.

You need Django 1.4 or above to run that. It might run on older versions but that is not tested.

### Notes

The ```airports``` manage command has options, see ```airports --help``` output.  Verbosity is controlled through LOGGING.
