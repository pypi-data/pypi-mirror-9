        =====

        JMeter is a tool used to test the reponses for a given HTTP request.
        However, a typical webpage is comprised of dozens of such requests. To
        accurately test the performance of a webpage with JMeter, you would need
        to perform a great deal of manual entry.
        
        HTTP Archives are great for recording all of the requests made on a page
        - exactly the data one would need to replicate all the requests for a
        JMeter test.
        
        This reads in a HTTP Archive, spanning one or multiple pages, and
        generates a JMeter test plan to replicate the requests. This can then be
        directly used by JMeter to begin testing.
