Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides information about the host you are running buildout on.
        
        
        Exposed Parameters
        ==================
        
        hostname
            The hostname of the machine buildout is running on, as returned by ``socket.gethostname()``
        fqdn
            The fully qualified domain of the machine buildout is running on, as return by ``socket.getfqdn()``.
            If no fqdn is available, this will be the same as hostname.
        interface.X.address
            The IP address of the network interface ``X``.
        user.name
            The name of the account running buildout
        user.uid
            The uid running buildout. Numerical.
        user.gid
            The gid running buildout. Numerical.
        user.home
            The home directory of the user running buildout
        vcs.type
            The type of checkout that buildout is being run from. Supports Mercurial ('hg'), Git ('git') or Subversion ('svn'), otherwise will be 'unknown'.
        vcs.branch
            The branch or that that buildout is being run from. Will be 'unknown' for unsupported VCS.
        
        
        Using facts
        ===========
        
        This example uses the missingbits echo recipe to print information about the current machine::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = echo
        
            [facts]
            recipe = isotoma.recipe.facts
        
            [echo]
            recipe = missingbits:echo
            echo =
                The hostname is ${facts:hostname}
                The fdqn is ${facts:fdqn}
                The main IP address is ${facts:interface.eth0.address}
                The VCS type is ${facts:vcs.type} and branch is ${facts:vcs.branch}
                The user is ${facts:user.name} and their home dir is ${facts:user.home}
