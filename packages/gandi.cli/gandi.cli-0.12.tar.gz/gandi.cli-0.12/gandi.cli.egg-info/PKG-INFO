        ## Installation
        
        ### Install with pip and virtualenv
        
            $ virtualenv /some/directory/gandi.cli
            $ source /some/directory/gandi.cli/bin/activate
            $ pip install gandi.cli
        
        ### Build from source
        
            $ cd /path/to/the/repository
            $ python setup.py install --user
        
        ### From the Debian package
        
            $ ln -sf packages/debian debian && debuild -us -uc -b && echo "Bisou"
        
        ## Getting started
        
        1. To get started, you can create a [free Gandi account](https://www.gandi.net/contact/create) and get your Gandi Handle
        2. [Generate your Production API Token](https://www.gandi.net/admin/api_key) from the account admin section
        3. You may also want to [top-up your prepaid account](https://www.gandi.net/prepaid)
        4. To manipulate VM's, you also need to [purchase credits](https://www.gandi.net/credit/buy) (you can use funds from your prepaid account)
        
        Then run the setup
        
            $ gandi setup
            > API Key: x134z5x4c5c          # copy-paste your api key
            > Environment [production] :    # press enter for Production, the default
            > SSH key [~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub] : # your SSH public key for hosting instances and servers
        
        See the [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) section for more details on configuration.
        
        ## Use cases
        
          * [Registering a domain name](#registering-a-domain-name)
          * [Creating a virtual machine](#creating-a-virtual-machine)
          * [Deploying a web application](#deploying-a-web-application)
        
        ### Registering a Domain Name
        
        Gandi is a domain name registrar since 1999. The oldest in France and one of the world's leading, Gandi is recognized for its No Bullshitâ„¢ trademark and approach to domain names.
        
        You can now buy and manage domains in any of the 500+ TLD's that Gandi offers from the command line.
        
        [Know more about Gandi Domains on the website](https://www.gandi.net/domain).
        
        #### 1. Buy a domain using the interactive prompt
        
            $ gandi domain create
            > Domain: example.com      # enter the domain name here
            > example.com is available
            > Duration [1] : 1         # enter the duration in years
        
        This will create a domain and use your default information for Ownership, Admin, Technical and Billing info.
        
        
        #### 2. Buy a domain in one line
        
            $ gandi domain create --domain example.com --duration 1
        
        #### 3. Buy a domain with custom contacts
        
            $ gandi domain create --domain example.com --duration 1 --owner XYZ123-GANDI --admin XYZ123-GANDI --tech XYZ123-GANDI --bill XYZ123-GANDI
        
        You can use the information of Gandi handles associated to Contacts in your account to setup Owner, Admin, Technical and Billing info.
        
        #### 3. List your domains
        
            $ gandi domain list
        
        #### 4. Get information about a domain
        
            $ gandi domain info example.com
        
        #### 5. List NS records of a domain
            $ gandi record list example.com
        
        You can use `--output` to extract your zone records in a file, then edit it and use `gandi record update example.com -f file` to update it easily.
        
        ### Creating a Virtual Machine
        
        Gandi Server offers powerful Xen- and Linux-based virtual machines since 2007.
        
        Virtual machines can be configured and upgraded on the fly to your liking. For example, you can start with 1GB of RAM, and run a command to add 2GB of RAM and 2 CPUs without even having to restart it.
        
        Gandi Server measures consumption by the hour and uses a prepaid credit system. To learn more, [check out the Gandi Server website](https://www.gandi.net/hosting/server/).
        
        #### 1. Create and access a VM
        
            $ gandi vm create
            * root user will be created.
            * SSH key authorization will be used.
            * No password supplied for vm (required to enable emergency web console access).
            * Configuration used: 1 cores, 256Mb memory, ip v4+v6, image Debian 7, hostname: temp1415183684
        
        Create a virtual machine with the default configuration and a random hostname.
        
        #### 2. Upgrade a VM
        
            $ gandi vm update temp1415183684 --memory 2048 --cores 2
        
        Set the VM's RAM to 2GB and add a CPU core on the fly.
        
        #### 3. Create a custom VM
        
            $ gandi vm create --datacenter US --hostname docker --cores 2 --memory 3072 --size 10240 --image "Ubuntu 14.04 64 bits LTS (HVM)" --run "curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ubuntu/ | sh"
            * root user will be created.
            * SSH key authorization will be used.
            * No password supplied for vm (required to enable emergency web console access).
            * Configuration used: 2 cores, 3072Mb memory, ip v4+v6, image Ubuntu 14.04 64 bits LTS, hostname: docker
        
        This command will setup the above VM, and install docker by running `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ubuntu/ | sh` after creation.
        
        #### 4. View your ressources
        
            $ gandi vm list
        
        #### 5. Get all the details about a VM
        
            $ gandi vm info docker
        
        
        ### Deploying a Web Application
        
        Gandi Simple Hosting is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) offering fast code deployment and easy scaling, powering over 50,000 apps since its inception in 2012.
        
        Instances can run apps in 4 languages (PHP, Python, Node.js and Ruby) along with one of 3 popular databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB) and operate on a managed platform with built-in http caching.
        
        Plans cover all scales, from small to world-class projects. [Check out the website for more information](https://www.gandi.net/hosting/simple).
        
        #### 1. Create an instance for your app
        
        
            $ gandi paas create --name myapp --type phpmysql --size S --datacenter FR --duration 1
        
        
        #### 2. Update code and deploy
        
            $ cd myapp
            $ git init .
            $ git add .
            $ git commit -m 'first commit'
            $ git push gandi master
            $ gandi deploy
        
        
        ## Advanced Usage
        
        ### All Commands
        
        To list all available commands, type `$ gandi --help`
        
        For extended instructions, check out the `man` page.
        
        ### Build manpage
        
        Install python-docutils and run:
        
            $ rst2man --no-generator gandicli.man.rst > gandi.1.man
        
        Then to read the manpage:
        
            $ man ./gandi.1.man
        
        ### Configuration
        
        Run `$ gandi setup` to configure your settings (see [Getting started](#getting-started))
        
        Use `$ gandi config` to set and edit custom variables.
        The default variables are:
          * `sshkey`         # path to your public ssh key
          * `api.host`       # the URL of the API endpoint to use (i.e OTE or Production)
          * `api.key`        # the relevant API key for the chosen endpoint
        
        ### Development
        
        To add a new command to the CLI:
          * check if there's an existing namespace to either add a command or an option to an already existing one
          * each command is composed of 2 python files, located in the `commands/` and `modules/` directories
            * `commands/` contains everything that is related to shell arguments, parameter validation, default values
            * `modules/` contains code that uses the Gandi API and can be used by other python scripts, or in the python shell.
            * `packages/` contains packaging code (see `packages/README.rst`)
        
        Code must follow PEP8 recommendations: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
        
        Docstrings should follow PEP257 recommendations: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
