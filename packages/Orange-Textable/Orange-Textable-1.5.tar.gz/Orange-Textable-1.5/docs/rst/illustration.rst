Illustration: mining Humanist
=============================

The following example is meant to show *what* Orange Textable typically does,
without considering (for now) every detail of *how* it does it.

In a paper reflecting on terminology in the field of Digital Humanities
[#]_, Patrik Svensson compares the evolution of the frequency of expressions
*Humanities Computing* and *Digital Humanities* over 20 years of archives of
the `Humanist discussion group <http://dhhumanist.org/>`_. He uses these
figures to show that while the former denomination remains prevalent over
these two decades, the latter has been quickly gaining ground since the 2000s.

The same experiment can be run with Orange Textable, by building a "visual
program" like the one shown on :ref:`figure 1 <illustration_fig1>` below:

Such a program is called a *schema*. Its visible part consists of a network
of interconnected units called *widget instances*. Each instance belongs to a
type, e.g. :ref:`URLs`, :ref:`Recode`, :ref:`Segment`, and so on. Widgets
are the basic blocks with which a variety of text analysis applications can be
built. Each corresponds to a fundamental operation, such as "import data from
an online source" (:ref:`URLs`) or "replace specific text patterns with
others" (:ref:`Recode`) for example. Connections between instances determine
the flow of data in the schema, and thus the order in which operations are
carried on. Several parallel paths can be constructed, as demonstrated here
by the :ref:`Recode` instance, which sends data to :ref:`Segment` as well as
:ref:`Count`.

Widget instances can (and indeed must) be individually parameterized in order
to "fine-tune" their operation. For example, double-clicking on the
:ref:`Recode` instance of :ref:`figure 1 <illustration_fig1>` above displays
the interface shown on :ref:`figure 2 <illustration_fig2>` below. What this
particular configuration means is that every line beginning with symbol ``|``
or ``>`` (**Regex** field) should be replaced with an empty string
(**Replacement string**): in other words, remove those lines that are marked
as being part of a reply to another message. There is a fair amount of
variation between widget interfaces, but regular expressions play an important
role in many of them and Orange Textable's flexibility owes a lot to them.

After executing the schema of :ref:`figure 1 <illustration_fig1>` above, the
resulting frequencies can be viewed by double-clicking on the **Data Table**
instance, whose interface is shown on :ref:`figure 3 <illustration_fig3>`
below. On the whole, these figures lend themselves to the same interpretation
as that of Patrik Svensson, but they differ wildly from the frequencies he
reports. This might be explained by the fact that, in the present
illustration, we have used *preprocessed* data `made available on the Humanist
website <http://dhhumanist.org/text.html>`_, or it might be that we have not
processed the data exactly like Svensson did. The user can always refer to the
Orange Textable schema (including the parameters of each instance) to
understand exactly the operations that it performs. [#]_ In this sense, Orange
Textable does not only attempt to make the construction of text analysis
programs easier; it aims to make *communicating* and *understanding* such
programs easier.

.. [#] The schema can be downloaded from :download:`here
       <schemas/humanist_mining_example.ows>`. Note that two decades of
       Humanist archives weigh dozens of megabytes and that retrieving these
       data from the Internet can take a few minutes depending on bandwidth.
       Please be patient if Orange Textable appears to be stalled when the
       schema is being opened.
