Segmentation processing widgets
===============================

Widgets of this category take *Segmentation* data in input and emit data of
the same type. Some of them (:ref:`Preprocess` and :ref:`Recode`) generate
modified text data. Others (:ref:`Merge`, :ref:`Segment`, :ref:`Select`,
:ref:`Intersect` and :ref:`Extract XML`) do not generate new text data but
only new *Segmentation* data. :ref:`Display`, finally, is mainly used to
visualize (or export) the details of a given *Segmentation* object (content
and address of segments, as well as their possible annotations).
