Textable was designed and implemented by `LangTech Sàrl
<http://langtech.ch>`_ on behalf of the `department of language and
information sciences (SLI) <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`_ at the `University of
Lausanne (Unil) <http://www.unil.ch>`_.

The largest part of funding was initially provided by the Unil's Teaching
innovation fund (`Fonds d'innovation pédagogique - FIP
<http://www.unil.ch/fip>`_), and led to the release of Textable v1.0 in summer
2012.

Textable's development has continued between 2012 and 2013, still carried on
by `LangTech Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`_, while the program was being
gradually integrated to courses taught at Unil's department of `SLI
<http://www.unil.ch/sli>`_ (where most of the tutorials that would later
become the :doc:`Getting started <getting_started>` section of this
documentation have been created).
 
In automn 2013, Textable became a registered Orange Canvas add-on and was
renamed to Orange Textable (v1.3). This promotion has made it possible to
reach a much larger pool of users, as witnessed by a steadily increasing
number of downloads.

In early 2014, Unil's `FIP <http://www.unil.ch/fip>`_ has renewed its support
to Orange Textable by granting a maintenance funding. This has made it
possible for `LangTech Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`_ to collaborate with the
creators of Orange Canvas, `University of Ljubljana's Biolab
<http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/laboratories/biolab/>`_ for producing
version v1.4 of Orange Textable.

In the meantime, `Unil's Faculty of Arts <http://www.unil.ch/lettres>`_ has
granted additional funding for translating Orange Textable's User guide from
French to English, then converting it into the electronic form you're
currently reading.

Besides `LangTech Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`_ and `Aris Xanthos 
<http://www.unil.ch/unisciences/arisxanthos>`_ who have been involved at about
every step of Orange Textable's conception, implementation, documentation, and
so on, a special mention should be made to Benjamin Gay (specifications,
conception and implementation), people at `Biolab
<http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/laboratories/biolab/>`_ (in particular Blaž
Zupan and Aleš Erjavec for conception and implementation work), Corinne
Morey (French to English translation of the user guide, preparation of the
online version of the documentation, and creation of most cookbook recipes),
and many students (and a few scholars) mostly at `Unil <http://www.unil.ch>`_
for their indispensable feedback as users of Orange Textable.
