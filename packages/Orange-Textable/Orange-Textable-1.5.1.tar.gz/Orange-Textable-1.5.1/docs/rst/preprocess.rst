Basic text preprocessing.

Signals
-------

Inputs:

* ``Segmentation``

  Segmentation covering the text that should be preprocessed

Outputs:

* ``Text data``

  Segmentation covering the modified text

Description
-----------

This widget inputs a segmentation, creates a modified copy of the content of
the segmentation, and outputs a new segmentation corresponding to the modified
data. The possible modifications are on the case (lower case/upper case) and
the replacing of accentuated characters by their non-accentuated equivalents.

Note that **Preprocess** creates a copy of each modified segment, which
increases the program's memory footprint; moreover this widget can only work
on segmentations without any overlap, which means no part of the text is
covered by more than one segment.

In the **Preprocessing** section of its interface (see :ref:`figure 1
<preprocess_fig1>` above), the **Transform case** checkbox triggers the
systematic modification of the case: select **to lower** to convert every
character to lower case and **to upper** to convert them to upper case. The
**Remove accents** checkbox controls the replacement of accentuated character
by their non-accentuated equivalents (é -> e, ç -> c, etc.).

The **Options** section enables the user to define the label of the output
segmentation (**Output segmentation label**). The **Copy annotations** button
copies all the annotations of the input segmentation to the output
segmentation; it is only accessible when the **Advanced settings** checkbox is
selected (otherwise the annotations are by default copied).

The **Info** section indicates the number of segments present in the output
segmentation, or the reasons why no segmentation is emitted (no input data,
overlaps in the input segmentation, etc.).

The **Send** button triggers the emission of a segmentation to the output
connection(s). When it is selected, the **Send automatically** checkbox
disables the button and the widget attempts to automatically emit a
segmentation at every modification of its interface or when its input data are
modified (by deletion or addition of a connection, or because modified data is
received through an existing connection).

.. _anchor_to_caveat:

Caveat
------

As one of the rare widgets of Textable that do create new *strings* and not
only new *segmentations*, **Preprocess** is prone to a very specific and
possibly disconcerting type of error, which can be best understood by studying
an example.

Suppose that you wish to count word frequency in the content of two
:ref:`Text Field` instances--a scenario similar to that illustrated in section
:doc:`Counting in specific contexts <counting_specific_contexts>`. You could
use :ref:`Merge` to combine the :ref:`Text Field` instances' output in a
single segmentation (see :ref:`figure 2 <preprocess_fig2>` below), then
segment the latter into words with :ref:`Segment`. You would eventually
feed both the segmentation emitted by :ref:`Segment` (specifying units) and
by :ref:`Merge` (specifying contexts) to an instance of :ref:`Count` for
building the frequency table.

Moreover, suppose that you want to convert the input texts to lower case
before counting word frequency. An intuitive way of performing this is by
inserting a **Preprocess** instance between :ref:`Merge` and :ref:`Segment` as
on :ref:`figure 3 <preprocess_fig3>` below. However, because **Preprocess**
creates a *new* string for each input segment and emits a segmentation that
refers to these new strings, this raises a rather insidious issue.

To no effect, :ref:`Count` will attempt to find occurrences of the units
specified by the segmentation received from :ref:`Segment` in the contexts
specified by the segmentation received from :ref:`Merge`; since those actually
belong to distinct strings, none of these units occurs in any of these
contexts and the frequency table will remain hopelessly empty.

Luckily, a small wiring modification suffices to entirely solve the problem:
the connection between :ref:`Merge` and :ref:`Count` should simply be replaced
by a *direct* connection between **Preprocess** and :ref:`Count`, as on
:ref:`figure 4 <preprocess_fig4>` below. This way, units and contexts refer
to the same set of strings and occurrences of the ones can be properly counted
in the others.
