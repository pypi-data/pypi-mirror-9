Cookbook
========

This section describes how to get a number of basic tasks done with Orange
Textable. Each task is explained by means of a concise, illustrated recipe.
The goal is to provide the user with a set of elementary operations which,
once properly chained, may form the basic skeleton of various more ambitious
projects.
