Description: # django-transactional-cleanup
        
        django-transactional-cleanup automatically deletes old file for FileField,
        ImageField and subclasses, and it also deletes files on models instance
        deletion.
        
        **Warning**: It depends on django-transaction-hooks app and you need to
        configure your database backend to use a django-transactional-hooks backend or
        any that use the django-transactional-hooks backend mixin. See the
        documentation here: https://django-transaction-hooks.readthedocs.org/ .
        
        ## How does it work?
        
        django-transactional-cleanup connects pre_save and post_delete signals to
        special functions(these functions delete old files) for each model which app is
        listed in INSTALLED_APPS above than 'django_transactional_cleanup'.
        
        ## Installation
            
            pip install django-transactional-cleanup
        
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Add django_transactional_cleanup to settings.py
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'django_transactional_cleanup', # should go after your apps
            )
        
        **django_transactional_cleanup** should be placed after all your apps. (At
        least after those apps which need to remove files.)
