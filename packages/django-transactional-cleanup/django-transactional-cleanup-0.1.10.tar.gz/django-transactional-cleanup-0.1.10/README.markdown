# django-transactional-cleanup

django-transactional-cleanup automatically deletes old file for FileField,
ImageField and subclasses, and it also deletes files on models instance
deletion.

**Warning**: It depends on django-transaction-hooks app and you need to
configure your database backend to use a django-transactional-hooks backend or
any that use the django-transactional-hooks backend mixin. See the
documentation here: https://django-transaction-hooks.readthedocs.org/ .

## How does it work?

django-transactional-cleanup connects pre_save and post_delete signals to
special functions(these functions delete old files) for each model which app is
listed in INSTALLED_APPS above than 'django_transactional_cleanup'.

## Installation
    
    pip install django-transactional-cleanup


## Configuration

Add django_transactional_cleanup to settings.py

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_transactional_cleanup', # should go after your apps
    )

**django_transactional_cleanup** should be placed after all your apps. (At
least after those apps which need to remove files.)
