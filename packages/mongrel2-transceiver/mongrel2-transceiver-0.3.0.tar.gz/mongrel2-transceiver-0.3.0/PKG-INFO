Description: Mongrel2 Transceiver was built to solve 3 major hassles that
        come with trying to handle ZMQ and WebSockets.
        
        1. Handling WebSockets properly
        2. Dynamically adding more connections to a running handlers
        3. Reliably destroying ZMQ Contexts
        
        Transceiver solves all these issues with an intuitive and simplistic syntax.
        
        WARNING: Mongrel2 Transceiver was primarily designed to work with Docker containers.  Therefore the
        default options for all the classes are not expecting to have issues binding to the default ports.
        It is your job to configure custom ports if you will be running in a single network environment.
        Every class has options for overriding the default ports and have been tested in a single network
        environment.
