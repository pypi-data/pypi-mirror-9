Description: djinn_contenttypes
        ===================
        
        This module provides the content type framework for Djinn. Content
        types are the 'things' that a user of the system can create, delete,
        edit and view.
        
        
        Views
        -----
        
        Djinn uses generic views for content types. Views behave differently
        according to how they are called: when called Ajax style or when
        modal=1 is passed as parameter, the template rendered will be 'modal',
        otherwise a complete HTML page will be rendered. Successfull add and
        edit views will return a 'record' like snippet, assuming that they
        were called to return an inline template view of the object.
        
        The following views normally apply:
        
         - Creation:
           Creation can either use a temporary object, in case the add screen already
           provides some means of relating things to the new object, or simply use the
           standard add view, that doesn't create anything untill a commit.
           The default templates for creation are:
              <app label>/<content type name>_add.html
              <app label>/<content type name>_add_modal.html
              djinn_contenttypes/base_add.html
              djinn_contenttypes/base_add_modal.html
        
         - Update: either update or JSON update
              <app label>/<content type name>_edit.html
              <app label>/<content type name>_edit_modal.html
              djinn_contenttypes/base_edit.html
              djinn_contenttypes/base_edit_modal.html
        
         - Delete: delete or JSON delete
        
         - View: base view or modal view
             <content type module>/<content type name>_modal_detail.html
             <content type module>/<content type name>_detail.html
              djinn_contenttypes/base_detail.html
              djinn_contenttypes/base_detail_modal.html
