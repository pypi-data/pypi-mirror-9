Description: # ROS build farm based on Docker
        
        This repository contains the scripts and templates to generate Jenkins jobs or
        alternatively shell scripts to run jobs locally.
        Please look in the [doc](doc/index.rst) folder for more information about how
        to invoke the job generation and an explanation of the different job types.
        
        The ROS build farm is using [Docker](http://www.docker.com) for each step in
        the process.
        It is based on the ROS distro specification
        [REP 143](http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0143.html) and uses a separate repository
        to configure the jobs being generated (e.g.
        [https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm_config](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm_config)
        ).
