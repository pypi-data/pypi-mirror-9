Activity
========

Activities are self generated classes to which you can pass an identifier,
and a list of tasks to perform. The activities are in between the decider and
the task.

For ease, two types of task runners are available: SyncTasks and AsyncTasks. If
you need something more specific, you should either create your own runner, or
you should create a main task that will then split the work.
