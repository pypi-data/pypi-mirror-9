Task
====

Tasks are small discrete applications that are meant to perform a defined
action within an activity. An activity can have more than one task, they can
run in series or in parallel.

Tasks can add values to the context by returning a dictionary that contains
the informations to add (useful if you need to pass information from one
task – in an activity, to another activity's task.)

Note:
    If you need a task runner that is not covered by the two scenarios below,
    you may need to just have a main task, and have this task split the work
    the way you want.
