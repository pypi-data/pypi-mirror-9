<h3>Page setup, print preview and printing</h3>
<br>I'm sure many of you print documents straight from the browser.
Mozilla Firebird allows you to edit the printing options as well, as a
ordinary text editor would do. The Firebird application is truly a
multi-functional browser. :)<br><br>
First
of all, from the drop down menu in the top left corner of the browser,
you can chose "File". Go File &gt; Page setup...and you will get these
two options:<br><br>

<br>
In "Format &amp; Options" you can chose orientation, portrait or
landscape. You can scale or make it auto adjust. If you want background
printed out (usually that's not necessary) just check the box which says "Print background (colors
&amp; images)".<br>

"Margins &amp; Header/Footer" you can adjust margins, as well as choose
what you want or don't want in the headers and footers, really it's
only your imagination which is the limit. :)<br>
<br>Now, as you see you have many of the same options as a regular text editor program aka Open Office, Word and such.<br>I
can't tell you what your settings should be, that's your choice. :) For
the next function, go File &gt; Print Preview...an you will get the
following options:<br>

<br>

<br>
If you look at the top tool bar, you got all your options at one place.
:) You can really access most functions from Print Preview, and lay the
finishing touch on your printout. Enjoy.<br>
