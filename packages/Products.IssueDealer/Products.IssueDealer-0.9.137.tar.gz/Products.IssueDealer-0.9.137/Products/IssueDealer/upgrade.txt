When upgrading, remember to run the update_catalog method, for
example, http://localhost:8080/IssueDealer/update_catalog if your
Issue Dealer instance is called IssueDealer.  It might be necessary to
run it twice.  If you're having problems after an upgrade, see
problems.txt.

Always do a backup of the Data.fs file before upgrading!
