Installing the Issue Dealer
===========================

This product requires Zope 2.7+, Zope is available for a number
of platforms and can be downloaded from http://www.zope.org

When you have installed Zope, unzip the archive in the Products
directory and restart Zope.  On Windows, this is typically c:\program
files\website\lib\python\products\.  If you're on Linux/Mac OS X, make
sure that the unpacked files are readable by the same user that runs
Zope.

Then go to Zope's management interface (usually
http://localhost:8080/manage), select Issue Dealer from the drop-down
list, and add it.  It can be named anything except issues (since
that's a variable name used within the Issue Dealer).

Once that has been done you'll be able to start using the Issue
Dealer, it should be fairly straight-forward to use, and we'll have
documentation ready around the 1.0 release just in case there's a need
for it.  :)

Configuring the Issue Dealer
============================

There are a number of things that can be configured in the Issue
Dealer, most of which are related to the notification system.  To
change the settings, edit the id_config.py file to suit your needs,
and restart Zope.

Extra functionality
===================

It is a very good idea to install the mxTidy library when editing
issues as HTML, if you're wondering how to do that, have a look at the
mxTidyHowTo.txt file in IssueDealerEpoz.

If you want to use the XML export/import feature, make sure that the
elementtree package is installed; it can be found at
