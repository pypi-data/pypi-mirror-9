How to setup notifications

  To setup notifications, an external script/tool is needed
  which retrieves the check_notifications URL in an Issue
  Dealer instance.

  Such a script can look like what's included in this directory
  in the file notify-example-script.sh.  Copy that script, make
  it executable (chmod +x notify-example-script.sh) and call
  it either by hand, or by an entry in your crontab (crontab -e)
  that looks something like this:

    10 2,7,12,19 * * * /home/nidelven/bin/notify-example-script.sh

  Make sure that wget is installed, you might have to edit the
  notification script if wget is installed in a different location.
