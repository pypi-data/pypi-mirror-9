<h3>What is it?</h3>

  <p class="indent">The Issue Dealer is a tool for managing issues, currently
  it focuses on the information in, and structuring of, issues.</p>

<h3>Why have you created it?</h3>

  <p class="indent">We needed a tool that could help organize and share information.
  It started as a basic 'folder and document' archive on Morten's
  computer, now it's evolving into an advanced (but simple to
  use!) information management and distribution system.</p>

<h3>Why is it free?</h3>

  <p class="indent">We give it away for free because you get to try it out, and
  then if you need customizing or hosting of it, we (as creators
  and maintainers of the software) can offer you a service.</p>

  <p class="indent">There is also an Enterprise (commercial) version available
  with some extra features like WebDAV publishing and enhanced
  search, and in the future contact and process handling.</p>

<h3>How are you developing it?</h3>

  <p class="indent">We're developing this tool 'as we go' and will be adding to it as we
  figure out what's needed and what's simple; we're using elements of XP in
  the development process, a lightweight and practial approach to software
  development.</p>

<h3>What happens next?</h3>

  <p class="indent">The focus for the 1.0 release is to make the application manage
  information, the focus for the 2.0 release is (for now) to make the
  application handle contacts and processes.</p>
