If you experience Zope hanging and eating up all the resources when
you try to access an Issue Dealer instance, and you're on a *BSD or
Mac OS X machine, try compiling python with

  make OPT="-DNDEBUG -g -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -DTHREAD_STACK_SIZE=1000000"

If you're having problems importing large batches of issues - keep
cool, we're experiencing them as well and are working on a fix.  If
possible, export and import smaller batches of objects.

If you're having other problems, of any kind, try this procedure
before reporting the bug.  It assumes that your Zope is running on
port 8080, and the Issue Dealer instance has the ID IssueDealer.

  Run http://localhost:8080/IssueDealer/update_catalog?delete=1

  and then

  run http://localhost:8080/IssueDealer/update_catalog

If that doesn't help, send an email to morten@nidelven-it.no
explaining the problem.
