Description: What is it?
        
          The Issue Dealer is a tool for managing issues, currently
          it focuses on the information in, and structuring of, issues.
        
          It can be used as a generic issue tracker, a knowledge management
          tool, a weblog or an outliner.
        
          It also contains an experimental framework for creating content
          classes through the web.
        
          It has been tested to work with 2.13.22 but is believed to
          work with older versions of Zope as well.
        
        Why have you created it?
        
          Initially the company I work for (Nidelven IT) needed a tool that
          could help organize and share information.  It started as a basic
          'folder and document' archive on my computer, now it's evolving
          into an advanced (but simple to use!) information management and
          distribution system.
        
          Some years ago I took it over as a personal project, and since I've
          spent so much time on it already and it works well for its purpose
          and that the LAF system is interesting, I'm going to keep updating
          it. I don't know what the future for Zope 2 will be, but seeing how
          different systems can survive I wouldn't be surprised if Zope 2 is
          well maintained 5-10 years down the road.
        
        Why is it free?
        
          It started out free, and distributing it under the GPL version 2 is
          practical, as it is a well-known software license .
        
          I'd like to start a community around this application eventually, so
          if you think this is an interesting application, get in touch and
          maybe we can do something together.
        
        How are you developing it?
        
          The project has recently been moved to GitHub, and will be located
          there for the forseeable future.  Bug-tracking etc. hasn't been
          setup, but emails and patches are welcome, as are suggestions on
          where to manage the project from.
        
        What happens next?
        
          The focus for the 1.0 release is to make the application manage
          information, the focus for the 2.0 release is a complete LAF
          system.
        
        Is it secure?
        
          Yes and no.  It is has been built so that access can be restricted
          to different features and levels, but once someone has access to
          viewing, adding, editing or something else, you should assume that
          they can access any part of the system.
        
        Does it scale?
        
          Probably not.  This product is primarily focused on small groups of
          people, and hasn't been stress-tested with big groups of users.
        
        What are the main features?
        
          The main features of the Issue Dealer are:
