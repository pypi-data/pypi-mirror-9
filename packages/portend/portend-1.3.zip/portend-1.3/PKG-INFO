Description: portend
        =======
        
        por·tend
        pôrˈtend/
        verb
        
            be a sign or warning that (something, especially something momentous or calamitous) is likely to happen.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Use portend to monitor TCP ports for bound or unbound states.
        
        For example, to wait for a port to be occupied, timing out after 3 seconds::
        
            portend.occupied('www.google.com', 80, timeout=3)
        
        Or to wait for a port to be free, timing out after 5 seconds::
        
            portend.free('::1', 80, timeout=5)
        
        The portend may also be executed directly. If the function succeeds, it
        returns nothing and exits with a status of 0. If it fails, it prints a
        message and exits with a status of 1. For example::
        
            python -m portend localhost:31923 free
            (exits immediately)
        
            python -m portend -t 1 localhost:31923 occupied
            (one second passes)
            Port 31923 not bound on localhost.
        
        Portend also exposes a ``find_available_local_port`` for identifying
        a suitable port for binding locally::
        
            port = portend.find_available_local_port()
            print(port, "is available for binding")
        
        
        1.3
        ===
        
        Added ``find_available_local_port`` for identifying a local port
        available for binding.
        
        1.2
        ===
        
        Only require ``pytest-runner`` when pytest is invoked.
        
        1.1
        ===
        
        Renamed functions:
        
         - wait_for_occupied_port: occupied
         - wait_for_free_port: free
        
        The original names are kept as aliases for now.
        
        Added execution support for the portend module. Invoke with
        ``python -m portend``.
        
        1.0
        ===
        
        Initial release based on utilities in CherryPy 3.5.
