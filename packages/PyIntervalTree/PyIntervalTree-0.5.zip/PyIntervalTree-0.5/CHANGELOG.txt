Version 0.5
-------------

    - Fixed issue #5. This is the last version of this project.

Version 0.4
-------------

    - Turns out, the tree was not balancing itself at all, as the corresponding code was wrong.
      
Version 0.3
-------------

    - Support for Python 3
    - Interval now inherits from a namedtuple. Benefits: should be faster. 
      Drawbacks: slight behavioural change (intervals not mutable anymore).

-------------

    - Slight changes for inclusion in PyPI.
    - Some documentation changes
    - Added tests
    - Fixed the bug, where interval addition via [] would not work properly in Python 2.7
      (see http://bugs.python.org/issue21785)
    - Added intervaltree.bio subpackage, adding some utilities for use in bioinformatics
