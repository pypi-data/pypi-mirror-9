        CHANGES
        =======
        
        -----
        0.2.0
        -----
        
        * Adds vagrant-based integration test to test compactor against reference libprocess.
        
        * Fixes Python 3 support, pinning to protobof >= 2.6.1 < 2.7 which has correct support.
        
        -----
        0.1.3
        -----
        
        * ``Context.singleton()`` now calls ``Thread.start`` on construction.
        
        * Pins compactor to ``tornado==4.1.dev1`` which forces you to use a
          master-built tornado distribution.
        
        -----
        0.1.2
        -----
        
        * Temporarily removes local dispatch so that local sending works with protobuf processes.
        
        -----
        0.1.1
        -----
        
        * Initial functioning release.
