        Introduction
        ============
        
        A docutils script converting reStructuredText into Beamer-flavoured LaTeX.
        
        Beamer is a LaTeX document class for presentations. rst2beamer
        provides a docutils writer that transforms reStructuredText
        into Beamer-flavoured LaTeX and provides a command-line script for the
        same. Via this script, reStructuredText can therefore be used to prepare slides
        and presentations.
        
        This is an unofficial fork (of https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rst2beamer) that
        runs on both Python 2 and 3.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Using ``pip``::
        
            $ pip install --upgrade rst2beamer3k
        
        Beamer dependency
        -----------------
        
        On MacPorts::
        
            $ sudo port install texlive-latex -x11 texlive-fonts-recommended -x11
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        rst2beamer should interpret a reasonable subset of reStructuredText and
        produce reasonable LaTeX. Not all features of Beamer have been implemented,
        just a (large) subset that allows the quick production of good looking slides.
        These include:
        
        * Overlay lists (i.e. list items that appear point-by-point).
        * Beamer themes.
        * Automatic centering and resizing of figures.
        * Embedded notes and the output of note slides.
        * Arranging slide contents into columns.
        
        Some examples can be found in the ``docs/examples`` directory of the
        distribution. In practice, rst2beamer can be used with ``pdflatex`` to get PDF
        versions of a presentation.
        
        rst2beamer is called::
        
            $ rst2beamer [options] [<source> [<destination>]]
        
        For example::
        
            $ rst2beamer infile.txt outfile.tex
        
        ``infile.txt`` contains the reStructuredText and ``outfile.tex`` contains the
        produced Beamer LaTeX.
        
        It supports the usual docutils and LaTeX writer (``rst2latex``) options, save
        the ``documentclass`` option (which is fixed to ``beamer``) and ``hyperref``
        options (which are already set in Beamer). It also supports::
        
            --theme=THEME           Specify Beamer theme.
            --overlaybullets=OVERLAYBULLETS
                                    Overlay bulleted items. Put [<+-| alert@+>] at the
                                    end of \begin{itemize} so that Beamer creats an
                                    overlay for each bulleted item and the presentation
                                    reveals one bullet at a time
            --centerfigs=CENTERFIGS
                                    Center figures.  All includegraphics statements will
                                    be put inside center environments.
            --documentoptions=DOCUMENTOPTIONS
                                    Specify document options. Multiple options can be
                                    given, separated by commas.  Default is
                                    "10pt,a4paper".
            --shownotes=SHOWNOTES   Print embedded notes along with the slides. Possible
                                    arguments include 'false' (don't show), 'only' (show
                                    only notes), 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom' (show
                                    in relation to the annotated slide).
        
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        Earlier versions of rst2beamer did not work with docutils 0.4, seemingly due
        to changes in the LaTeX writer. While this has been fixed, most work has been
        done with docutils snapshots from version 0.5 and up. In balance, users are
        recommended to update docutils.
        
        More recently, changes in the LaTeX writer in docutils 0.6 broke rst2beamer
        again. We think all those bugs have been caught.
        
        Not all features of Beamer are supported, and some - that deal with with page
        layout or presentation - may never be. Introducing complex syntax to achieve
        complex and specific page effects defeats the point of reStructuredText's
        simple and easy-to-write format. If you need a complex presentation, use
        PowerPoint or Keynote.
        
        If the content for an individual slide is too large, it will simply overflow
        the edges of the slide and disappear. Arguably, this is a sign you should put
        less on each slide.

        History
        =======
        
        
        v0.8.6a0, ???
        -------------
        
        * Use better defaults. The default theme is now ``Ilmenau`` and the
          ``--overlaybullets`` is now disabled by default.
        
        
        v0.8.5, 2015-03-07
        ------------------
        
        * Respect ``--language`` in the context of admonition directives.
        
        
        v0.8.4, 2014-11-14
        ------------------
        
        * Fix width calculation in columns.
        
        
        v0.8.3, 2014-08-26
        ------------------
        
        * Improve scaling.
        
        
        v0.8.2, 2013-12-01
        ------------------
        
        * Enable syntax highlighting by default.
        
        
        v0.8, 2013-06-04
        ----------------
        
        * Added Python 3 support.
        
        
        v0.6.6, 2009-11-06
        ------------------
        
        * Added experimental support for codeblocks, which may be syntax-colored with
          Pygments.
        
        * Normalised all directive names to ``beamer-`` (as opposed to ``r2b_``) in
          line with general docutils style, although the old names are still silently
          supported.
        
        
        v0.6.4, 2009-10-22
        ------------------
        
        * The parsed-literal environment was losing indentation, and perhaps has been
          since docutils 0.4. It now works correctly.
        
        * Added "calling" information to examples. Also added bullet example.
        
        
        v0.6.2, 2009-10-20
        ------------------
        
        * It seems there have been some changes in the docutils LaTeX2e writer, which
          the Beamer writer is based upon. Hopefully they've all been caught.
        
        * Corrected url in header of source, as well as some misspellings.
        
        
        v0.6.1, 2009-09-14
        ------------------

        * Added manual
        
        
        v0.6, 2009-09-03
        ----------------
        
        * Introduced column environment
        
        
        v0.5.3, 2009-07-16
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed manifest so source included (facepalm)
        
        * Changed setup.py to get single-file module to install
        
        
        v0.5.1, 2009-05-08
        ------------------

        v0.5, 2009-05-07
        ----------------
        
        * Shift to setuptools distribution with script installation.
        
        
        v0.3, 2009-03-25
        ----------------
        
        * RK takes over. Sections and subsections are supported. Images default to
          being centered and having a height of 0.7\textheight.
        
        
        v0.2.1, 2008-08-30
        ------------------
        
        * Date approximate. Earlier versions of rst2beamer did not work with docutils
          0.4, seemingly due to changes in the LaTeX writer.
        
        
        v0.2.0, 2007-08-30
        ------------------
