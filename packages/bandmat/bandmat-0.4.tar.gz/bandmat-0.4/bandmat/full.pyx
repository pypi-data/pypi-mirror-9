"""Operations involving the bands of square matrices.

This module provides operations involving the bands of square matrices which
are stored as numpy arrays.
For example it provides functions to construct a square matrix with given band,
and to extract the band from an arbitrary square matrix.
Though this is closely related to the representation of square banded matrices
used by the `BandMat` class in the `core` module, it is logically distinct.
