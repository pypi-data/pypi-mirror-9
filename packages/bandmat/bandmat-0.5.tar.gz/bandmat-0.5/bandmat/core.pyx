class BandMat(object):
    """A memory-efficient representation of a square banded matrix.

    An N by N matrix with bandwidth D can be stored efficiently by storing its
    band as a rectangular D by N matrix.
    This class is a lightweight wrapper around a rectangular matrix being used
    in this way, and stores additional details needed to recover the square
    matrix such as the lower and upper bandwidths.

    The representation used for the rectangular matrix is the same one used by
    BLAS and LAPACK (and thus scipy): the columns of the rectangular matrix are
    (parts of) the columns of the square matrix being represented, and the
    successive rows of the rectangular matrix give the superdiagonals, diagonal
    and subdiagonals in order (starting with the outermost superdiagonal and
    ending with the outermost subdiagonal).
    See the "Band Storage" section of the LAPACK Users' Guide at
    http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/node124.html or the docstring for
    scipy.linalg.solve_banded for some examples.

    `l` is the number of subdiagonals stored and `u` is the number of
    superdiagonals stored.
    Thus `l` and `u` determine the band in which the entries of the represented
    matrix can be non-zero.
    `data` is the LAPACK-style banded matrix representation of the square
    matrix (or of the transpose of the square matrix if `transposed` is True)
    stored as a numpy array.
    Note that if `transposed` is True, `l` and `u` still refer to the square
    matrix being represented rather than to its transpose.
