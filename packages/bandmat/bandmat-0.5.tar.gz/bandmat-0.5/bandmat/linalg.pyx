"""Linear algebra operations for banded matrices.

Several of the functions in this module deal with symmetric banded matrices.
Symmetric banded matrices can in principle be stored even more efficiently than
general banded matrices, by not storing the superdiagonals (or subdiagonals).
However in bandmat the simpler, more explicit representation which stores the
whole band is used instead.
This is slightly less efficient in terms of memory and time, but results in a
more unified interface and simpler code in the author's limited experience.
Note that this is in line with the convention used by numpy and scipy for
symmetric "full" (i.e. non-banded) matrices, where both the upper and lower
triangles are represented in memory.

    Using lower == True is slightly more time and space efficient than using

    The default is False only for compatibility with the scipy implementation.

    (This simple implementation seems to be much faster than the scipy
    implementation, especially for small bandwidths.
    This is surprising since the scipy implementation wraps an LAPACK call
    which one would expect to be very fast.
    I am still unsure why this is, though I have checked it is not to do with
    Fortran-contiguous versus C-contiguous ordering.
    The scipy implementation performs a relatively expensive finite-value check
    which is arguably not necessary for our implementation, but this only
    accounts for part of the difference.)
