"""An example of using the bandmat package for a non-trivial application.

This script demonstrates how the bandmat package can be used to write a simple
but very efficient implementation of the maximum probability speech parameter
generation algorithm used in statistical speech synthesis.
(This algorithm is also sometimes known as maximum likelihood speech parameter
generation, but this is a misnomer since the quantity being maximized is not a
function of the model parameters and is therefore not a likelihood.)
Given a sequence of mean and variance parameters over time, the maximum
probability speech parameter generation algorithm computes the natural
parameters of a corresponding Gaussian distribution over trajectories, and then
computes the mean trajectory using a banded Cholesky decomposition.
The mean trajectory is also the most likely or maximum probability trajectory.
