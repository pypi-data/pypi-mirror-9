PowerApp
========

PowerApp is a tool to extend the functionality of your Todoist account by
integrating it with third-party applications. We have created a number of
built-in integrations with Google Calendar, GitHub, Evernote and HackerNews. We
plan to add more of them, and expect third-party developers to join the process!

If you just want to take advantage of the default functionality, start with
our guide :ref:`quickstart_heroku`.

If you are a developer and willing to create your own integration, consider
starting from :ref:`developer_guide`
