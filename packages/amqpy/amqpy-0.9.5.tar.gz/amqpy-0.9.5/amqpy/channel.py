        various properties that control the durability of the queue and its contents, and the level
        of sharing for the queue. A tuple containing the queue name, message count, and consumer
        count is returned, which is essential for declaring automatically named queues.

        * If `passive` is specified, the server state is not modified (a queue will not be
          declared), and the server only checks if the specified queue exists and returns its
          properties. If the queue does not exist, the server must raise a 404 NOT FOUND channel
          exception.
        * The server must create a default binding for a newly-created queue to the default
          exchange, which is an exchange of type 'direct'.
        * Queue names starting with 'amq.' are reserved for use by the server. If an attempt is
          made to declare a queue with such a name, and the `passive` flag is disabled, the server
          must raise a 403 ACCESS REFUSED connection exception.
        * The server must raise a 405 RESOURCE LOCKED channel exception if an attempt is made to
          access a queue declared as exclusive by another open connection.
        * The server must ignore the `auto_delete` flag if the queue already exists.

        RabbitMQ supports the following useful additional arguments:

        * x-max-length (int): maximum queue size
            * Queue length is a measure that takes into account ready messages, ignoring
              unacknowledged messages and message size. Messages will be dropped or dead-lettered
              from the front of the queue to make room for new messages once the limit is reached.

        method could in principle apply to both peers, it is currently meaningful only for the
        server.

          to be sent down the channel. Prefetching gives a performance improvement. This field

          more unacknowledged messages.
        * The `prefetch_count` specifies a prefetch window in terms of whole messages. This field
          may be used in combination with the prefetch-size field; a message will only be sent in
          advance if both prefetch windows (and those at the channel and connection level) allow
          it. The prefetch-count is ignored if the no-ack option is set.
