"""
This module's purpose is to provide compatibility for Python 3.2 and PyPy3 (which is based on Python
3.2).

The primary method of providing compatibility is by backporting Python 3.3+ features through
monkey-patching. However, this is only done when safe, i.e., when monkey-patching does not change
the behaviour of existing objects.
