#: The stack name.  Its value is used to tag servers and other cloud resources.
NAME = 'name'

#: The stack version.  Often, you need a global version of a stack in a
#: playbook.  E.g. when a web client wants to query a web service for API
#: compatibility, the playbooks could configure the web service to report this
#: stack version.
VERSION = 'version'

#: The ordered list of playbooks to run *after* provisioning the cloud
#: resources.
PLAYBOOKS = 'playbooks'

#: The resource provider (e.g. ``aws``, ``hpcloud``).  Values for the
#: ``provider`` attribute will be used to look up the appropriate
#: :class:`~bang.providers.bases.Provider` subclass to use when instantiating
#: the associated resource.
PROVIDER = 'provider'

#: A dict containing credentials for various cloud providers in which the keys
#: can be any valid provider.  E.g.  ``aws``, ``hpcloud``.
DEPLOYER_CREDS = 'deployer_credentials'

#: The directory in which to look for bang config files using their basenames.
#: E.g. if your config_dir is specified as ``$HOME/bang-configs``, the
#: following bang runs are equivalent::
#:
#:     bang my_web_app deploy
#:
#: And::
#:
#:     bang $HOME/bang-configs/my_web_app.yml $HOME/bang-configs/deploy.yml
CONFIG_DIR = 'config_dir'

#: The top-level key for logging-related configuration options.
LOGGING = 'logging'

#: A dict containing ansible tuning variables.
ANSIBLE = 'ansible'

#: Like chicken fried chicken... this is a way to configure the name of the tag
#: in which the combined stack-role (a.k.a. *name*) will be stored.  By
#: default, unless this is specified directly in ~/.bangrc, the *name* value
#: will be assigned to a tag named "Name" (this is the default tag displayed
#: in the AWS management console).  I.e. using Bang defaults, the server
#: named "bar" in the stack named "foo" will have the following tags::
#:
#:     stack:  foo
#:     role:   bar
#:     Name:   foo-bar
#:
#: In some cases, admins may have other purposes for the "Name" tag.  If
#: ~/.bangrc were to have ``name_tag_name`` set to ``descriptor``, then the
#: server described above would have the following tags::
#:
#:     stack:       foo
#:     role:        bar
#:     descriptor:  foo-bar
#:
#: To prevent Bang from assigning the *name* value to a tag, assign an empty
#: string to the ``name_tag_name`` attribute in ~/.bangrc.
NAME_TAG_NAME = 'name_tag_name'

#: This is a *derived* attribute that Bang provides for instance tagging, and
#: for Ansible playbooks to consume.  It's a combination of the :attr:`NAME`
#: and the :attr:`VERSION`.
STACK = 'stack'

KEY = 'key'

#: This is a *derived* attribute that Bang provides for instance tagging, and
#: for Ansible playbooks to consume.  It's a combination of the :attr:`NAME`
#: and the :attr:`VERSION`.
SERVER_CLASS = 'server_class'
