# This is an example configuration file for Bang.
#
# At its simplest, Bang is just an alternative to ``ansible-playbook`` behaving
# as a playbook runner whose config file is effectively the source for the
# ansible host inventory.  This configuration file merely describes a
# previously provisioned server and runs a simple playbook.
