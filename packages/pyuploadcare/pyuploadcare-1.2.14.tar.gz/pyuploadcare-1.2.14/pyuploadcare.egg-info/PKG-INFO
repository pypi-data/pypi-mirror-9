        PyUploadcare: a Python library for Uploadcare
        =============================================

        The most important thing for us at `Uploadcare`_ is to make file uploading on
        the web really easy. Everyone is used to the routine work, related to allowing
        users upload their userpics or attach resumes: from installing image processing
        libraries to creating folder with right permissions to ensuring the server
        never goes down or out of space to enabling CDN. Feature like ability to simply
        use a picture from Facebook or manual cropping are much more burdensome,
        hence rare. Uploadcare's goal is to change the status quo.
        
        This library consists of an API interface for `Uploadcare`_ and a couple
        of Django goodies.
        
        A simple Uploadcare ``ImageField`` can be added to an existing Django project
        in just a couple of `simple steps`_. As a result, your users
        are going to be able to see the progress of the upload, choose files from
        Google Drive or Instagram, and edit form while files are uploading
        asynchornously.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from django.db import models
        
            from pyuploadcare.dj import ImageField
        
        
            class Candidate(models.Model):
        
                photo = ImageField(blank=True, manual_crop="")

        Features
        --------
        
        - Django widget with useful manual crop and multiupload;
        - *ucare* console utility;
        - hosted assets (Kudos to `Sławek Ehlert`_!).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install it, just run:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install pyuploadcare
        
        or, if you're into vintage:

        Testing
        -------
        
        Besides the `Travis CI`_ we use tox. In order to run tests just:

            $ pip install tox
            $ tox

        1.2.1
        ~~~~~
        
        ``https://ucarecdn.com/`` URL was returned to serve widget's assets.
        
        
        1.2
        ~~~
        
        - CDN URL has been changed to ``http://www.ucarecdn.com/``. Previous URL
          ``https://ucarecdn.com/`` is depricated.
        - Widget was updated up to *0.10.1*.
        
        1.1
        ~~~
        
        - Widget was updated up to *0.10*.
        - Default API version was updated up to *0.3*.
        - Django settings were merged into UPLOADCARE dictionary.
        - Performance was improved by reusing requests' session.
        
        1.0.2
        ~~~~~
        
        ``UnicodeDecodeError`` was fixed. This bug appears when
        `request <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/>`_'s ``method``
        param is unicode and ``requests.request()`` got ``files`` argument, e.g.:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> requests.request(u'post', u'http://httpbin.org/post',
            ...                  files={u'file': open('README.rst', 'rb')})
            UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc5 ...
        
        1.0.1
        ~~~~~
        
        - Widget was updated up to *0.8.1.2*.
        - It was invoking ``File.store()``, ``FileGroup.store()`` methods on every
          model instance saving, e.g.:
        
          .. code-block:: python
        
              photo.title = 'new title'
              photo.save()
        
          Now it happens while saving by form, namely by calling
          ``your_model_form.is_valid()``. There is other thing that can trigger
          storing -- calling ``photo.full_clean()`` directly.
