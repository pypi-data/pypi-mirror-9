Extending SkoolKit
==================

Extension modules
-----------------
While creating a disassembly of a game, you may find that SkoolKit's suite of
:ref:`skool macros <skoolMacros>` is inadequate for certain tasks. For example,
the game might have large tile-based sprites that you want to create images of
for the HTML disassembly, and composing long :ref:`udgArray` macros for them
would be too tedious. Or you might want to insert a timestamp in the header of
the ASM disassembly so that you (or others) can keep track of when your ASM
files were written.

One way to solve these problems is to add custom methods that could be called
by a :ref:`call` macro. But where to add the methods? SkoolKit's core
HTML writer and ASM writer classes are skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter and
skoolkit.skoolasm.AsmWriter, so you could add the methods to those classes. But
a better way is to subclass HtmlWriter and AsmWriter in a separate extension
module, and add the methods there; then that extension module can be easily
used with different versions of SkoolKit, and shared with other people.

A minimal extension module would look like this::

  # Extension module in the skoolkit package directory
  from .skoolhtml import HtmlWriter
  from .skoolasm import AsmWriter

  class GameHtmlWriter(HtmlWriter):
      pass

  class GameAsmWriter(AsmWriter):
      pass

The next step is to get SkoolKit to use the extension module for your game.
First, place the extension module (let's call it `game.py`) in the `skoolkit`
package directory; to locate this directory, run :ref:`skool2html.py` with the
``-p`` option::

  $ skool2html.py -p
  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/skoolkit

(The package directory may be different on your system.) With `game.py` in
place, add the following line to the :ref:`ref-Config` section of your
disassembly's `ref` file::

  HtmlWriterClass=skoolkit.game.GameHtmlWriter

If you don't have a `ref` file yet, create one (ideally named `game.ref`,
assuming the `skool` file is `game.skool`); if the `ref` file doesn't have a
``[Config]`` section yet, add one.

Now whenever :ref:`skool2html.py` is run on your `skool` file (or `ref` file),
SkoolKit will use the GameHtmlWriter class instead of the core HtmlWriter
class.

To get :ref:`skool2asm.py` to use GameAsmWriter instead of the core AsmWriter
class when it's run on your `skool` file, add the following :ref:`writer` ASM
directive somewhere after the ``@start`` directive, and before the ``@end``
directive (if there is one)::

  @writer=skoolkit.game.GameAsmWriter

The `skoolkit` package directory is a reasonable place for an extension module,
but it could be placed in another package, or somewhere else as a standalone
module. For example, if you wanted to keep a standalone extension module in
`~/.skoolkit`, it should look like this::

  # Standalone extension module
  from skoolkit.skoolhtml import HtmlWriter
  from skoolkit.skoolasm import AsmWriter

  class GameHtmlWriter(HtmlWriter):
      pass

  class GameAsmWriter(AsmWriter):
      pass

Then, assuming the extension module is `game.py`, set the ``HtmlWriterClass``
parameter thus::

  HtmlWriterClass=~/.skoolkit:game.GameHtmlWriter

and the ``@writer`` directive thus::

  @writer=~/.skoolkit:game.GameAsmWriter

The HTML writer or ASM writer class can also be specified on the command line
by using the ``-W``/``--writer`` option of :ref:`skool2html.py` or
:ref:`skool2asm.py`. For example::

  $ skool2html.py -W ~/.skoolkit:game.GameHtmlWriter game.skool

Specifying the writer class this way will override any ``HtmlWriterClass``
parameter in the `ref` file or ``@writer`` directive in the `skool` file.

If you intend to distribute your extension module, and you want it to work
however it ends up being used - as a module in the `skoolkit` package
directory, or as a standalone module - you can use the following technique to
import AsmWriter and HtmlWriter::

  # Module that works both standalone and in the skoolkit package directory
  try:
      from .skoolhtml import HtmlWriter
      from .skoolasm import AsmWriter
  except (ValueError, SystemError, ImportError):
      from skoolkit.skoolhtml import HtmlWriter
      from skoolkit.skoolasm import AsmWriter

#CALL methods
-------------
Implementing a method that can be called by a :ref:`call` macro is done by
adding the method to the HtmlWriter or AsmWriter subclass in the extension
module.

One thing to be aware of when adding a ``#CALL`` method to a subclass of
HtmlWriter is that the method must accept an extra parameter in addition to
those passed from the ``#CALL`` macro itself: `cwd`. This parameter is set to
the current working directory of the file from which the ``#CALL`` macro is
executed, which may be useful if the method needs to provide a hyperlink to
some other part of the disassembly (as in the case where an image is being
created).

Let's say your sprite-image-creating method will accept two parameters (in
addition to `cwd`): `sprite_id` (the sprite identifier) and  `fname` (the image
filename). The method (let's call it `sprite`) would look something like this::

  from .skoolhtml import HtmlWriter

  class GameHtmlWriter(HtmlWriter):
      def sprite(self, cwd, sprite_id, fname):
          img_path = self.image_path(fname)
          if self.need_image(img_path):
              udgs = self.build_sprite(sprite_id)
              self.write_image(img_path, udgs)
          return self.img_element(cwd, img_path)

With this method (and an appropriate implementation of the `build_sprite`
method) in place, it's possible to use a ``#CALL`` macro like this::

  #UDGTABLE
  { #CALL:sprite(3,jumping) }
  { Sprite 3 (jumping) }
  TABLE#

Adding a ``#CALL`` method to the AsmWriter subclass is equally simple. The
timestamp-creating method (let's call it `timestamp`) would look something like
this::

  import time
  from .skoolasm import AsmWriter

  class GameAsmWriter(AsmWriter):
      def timestamp(self):
          return time.strftime("%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z")

With this method in place, it's possible to use a ``#CALL`` macro like this::

  ; This ASM file was generated on #CALL:timestamp()

Skool macros
------------
Another way to add a custom method is to implement it as a skool macro. The
main differences between a skool macro and a ``#CALL`` method are:

* a ``#CALL`` macro's parameters are automatically evaluated and passed to the
  ``#CALL`` method; a skool macro's parameters must be parsed and evaluated
  manually (typically by using one or more of the
  :ref:`macro-parsing utility functions <ext-MacroParsing>`)
* every optional parameter in a skool macro can be assigned a default value if
  omitted; in a ``#CALL`` method, only the optional arguments at the end can be
  assigned default values if omitted, whereas any others are set to `None`
* numeric parameters in a ``#CALL`` macro are automatically converted to
  numbers before being passed to the ``#CALL`` method; no automatic conversion
  is done on the parameters of a skool macro

In summary: a ``#CALL`` method is generally simpler to implement than a skool
macro, but skool macros are more flexible.

Implementing a skool macro is done by adding a method named `expand_macroname`
to the HtmlWriter or AsmWriter subclass in the extension module. So, to
implement a ``#SPRITE`` or ``#TIMESTAMP`` macro, we would add a method named
`expand_sprite` or `expand_timestamp`.

A skool macro method must accept either two or three parameters, depending on
whether it is implemented on a subclass of AsmWriter or HtmlWriter:

* ``text`` -  the text that contains the skool macro
* ``index`` - the index of the character after the last character of the macro
  name (that is, where to start looking for the macro's parameters)
* ``cwd`` - the current working directory of the file from which the macro is
  being executed; this parameter must be supported by skool macro methods on an
  HtmlWriter subclass

A skool macro method must return a 2-tuple of the form ``(end, string)``, where
``end`` is the index of the character after the last character of the macro's
parameter string, and ``string`` is the HTML or text to which the macro will be
expanded.

The `expand_sprite` method on GameHtmlWriter may therefore look something like
this::

  from .skoolhtml import HtmlWriter

  class GameHtmlWriter(HtmlWriter):
      # #SPRITEspriteId[{x,y,width,height}](fname)
      def expand_sprite(self, text, index, cwd):
          end, img_path, crop_rect, sprite_id = self.parse_image_params(text, index, 1)
          if self.need_image(img_path):
              udgs = self.build_sprite(sprite_id)
              self.write_image(img_path, udgs, crop_rect)
          return end, self.img_element(cwd, img_path)

With this method (and an appropriate implementation of the `build_sprite`
method) in place, the ``#SPRITE`` macro might be used like this::

  #UDGTABLE
  { #SPRITE3(jumping) }
  { Sprite 3 (jumping) }
  TABLE#

The `expand_timestamp` method on GameAsmWriter would look something like this::

  import time
  from .skoolasm import AsmWriter

  class GameAsmWriter(AsmWriter):
      def expand_timestamp(self, text, index):
          return index, time.strftime("%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z")

.. _ext-MacroParsing:

Parsing skool macros
--------------------
The skoolkit.skoolmacro module provides some utility functions that may be used
to parse the parameters of a skool macro.

.. autofunction:: skoolkit.skoolmacro.parse_ints

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0
      Added the *names* parameter and support for keyword arguments; *index*
      defaults to 0.

.. autofunction:: skoolkit.skoolmacro.parse_params

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      Added the *except_chars* and *only_chars* parameters.

HtmlWriter also provides a method for parsing the parameters of an
image-creating skool macro.

.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.parse_image_params

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      If *path_id* is blank or *None*, ``image_path`` is equal to ``fname``;
      added the *ints* parameter.

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0
      Added the *names* parameter and support for keyword arguments.

   .. versionchanged:: 4.2
      Added the *frame* and *alt* parameters.

Parsing ref files
-----------------
HtmlWriter provides some convenience methods for extracting text and data from
`ref` files. These methods are described below.

.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.get_section
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.get_sections
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.get_dictionary
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.get_dictionaries

Memory snapshots
----------------
The `snapshot` attribute on HtmlWriter and AsmWriter is a 65536-element list
that is populated with the contents of any ``DEFB``, ``DEFM``, ``DEFS`` and
``DEFW`` statements in the `skool` file.

A simple ``#PEEK`` macro that expands to the value of the byte at a given
address might be implemented by using `snapshot` like this::

  from .skoolhtml import HtmlWriter
  from .skoolasm import AsmWriter
  from .skoolmacro import parse_ints

  class GameHtmlWriter(HtmlWriter):
      # #PEEKaddress
      def expand_peek(self, text, index, cwd):
          end, address = parse_ints(text, index, 1)
          return end, str(self.snapshot[address])

  class GameAsmWriter(AsmWriter):
      # #PEEKaddress
      def expand_peek(self, text, index):
          end, address = parse_ints(text, index, 1)
          return end, str(self.snapshot[address])

HtmlWriter also provides some methods for saving and restoring memory
snapshots, which can be useful for temporarily changing graphic data or the
contents of data tables. These methods are described below.

.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.push_snapshot
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.pop_snapshot
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.get_snapshot_name

.. _ext-Graphics:

Graphics
--------
If you are going to implement custom image-creating ``#CALL`` methods or skool
macros, you will need to make use of the skoolkit.skoolhtml.Udg class.

The Udg class represents an 8x8 graphic (8 bytes) with a single attribute byte,
and an optional mask.

.. autoclass:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.Udg

A simple ``#INVERSE`` macro that creates an inverse image of a UDG might be
implemented like this::

  from .skoolhtml import HtmlWriter, Udg
  from .skoolmacro import parse_ints

  class GameHtmlWriter(HtmlWriter):
      # #INVERSEaddress,attr
      def expand_inverse(self, text, index, cwd):
          end, address, attr = parse_ints(text, index, 2)
          img_path = self.image_path('inverse{0}_{1}'.format(address, attr))
          if self.need_image(img_path):
              udg_data = [b ^ 255 for b in self.snapshot[address:address + 8]]
              udg = Udg(attr, udg_data)
              self.write_image(img_path, [[udg]])
          return end, self.img_element(cwd, img_path)

The Udg class provides two methods for manipulating an 8x8 graphic: `flip` and
`rotate`.

.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.Udg.flip
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.Udg.rotate

If you are going to implement ``#CALL`` methods or skool macros that create
animated images, you will need to make use of the skoolkit.skoolhtml.Frame
class.

The Frame class represents a single frame of an animated image.

.. autoclass:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.Frame

   .. versionadded:: 3.6

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0
      The *mask* parameter specifies the type of mask to apply (see
      :ref:`masks`).

HtmlWriter provides the following image-related convenience methods.

.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.image_path
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.need_image
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.write_image

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0
      The *mask* parameter specifies the type of mask to apply (see
      :ref:`masks`).

.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.write_animated_image

   .. versionadded:: 3.6

.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.img_element
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.screenshot
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.flip_udgs
.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.rotate_udgs

HtmlWriter initialisation
-------------------------
If your HtmlWriter subclass needs to perform some initialisation tasks, such as
creating instance variables, or parsing `ref` file sections, the place to do
that is the `init()` method.

.. automethod:: skoolkit.skoolhtml.HtmlWriter.init

For example::

  from .skoolhtml import HtmlWriter

  class GameHtmlWriter(HtmlWriter):
      def init(self):
          # Get character names from the ref file
          self.characters = self.get_dictionary('Characters')
