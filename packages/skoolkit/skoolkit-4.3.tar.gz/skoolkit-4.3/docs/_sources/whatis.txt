What is SkoolKit?
=================
SkoolKit is a collection of utilities that can be used to disassemble a
Spectrum_ game (or indeed any piece of Spectrum software written in machine
code) into a format known as a `skool` file. Then, from this `skool` file, you
can use SkoolKit to create a browsable disassembly in HTML format, or a
re-assemblable disassembly in ASM format. So the `skool` file is - from start
to finish as you develop it by organising and annotating the code - the common
'source' for both the reader-friendly HTML version of the disassembly, and the
developer- and assembler-friendly ASM version of the disassembly.

The latest stable release of SkoolKit can always be obtained from
`skoolkit.ca <http://skoolkit.ca/>`__; the latest development version can be
found on `GitHub <http://github.com/skoolkid/skoolkit>`__.

Features
--------
SkoolKit can:

* convert a TAP or TZX file into a 'pristine' snapshot (using
  :ref:`tap2sna.py`)
* disassemble SNA, Z80 and SZX snapshots as well as raw memory files
* distinguish code from data by using a code execution map produced by an
  emulator
* build still and animated PNG/GIF images from graphic data in the game
  snapshot (using the :ref:`UDG`, :ref:`UDGARRAY`, :ref:`FONT` and :ref:`SCR`
  macros)
* create hyperlinks between routines and data blocks that refer to each other
  (by use of the :ref:`R` macro in annotations, and automatically in the
  operands of ``CALL`` and ``JP`` instructions)
* neatly render lists of bugs, trivia and POKEs on separate pages (using
  :ref:`ref-Bug`, :ref:`ref-Fact` and :ref:`ref-Poke` sections in a `ref` file)
* produce ASM files that include bugfixes declared in the `skool` file (with
  :ref:`ofix`, :ref:`bfix` and other ASM directives)
* produce TAP files from assembled code (using :ref:`bin2tap.py`)

For a demonstration of SkoolKit's capabilities, take a look at the complete
disassemblies of `Skool Daze`_, `Back to Skool`_, `Contact Sam Cruise`_,
`Manic Miner`_ and `Jet Set Willy`_. The latest stable releases of the source
`skool` files for these disassemblies can always be obtained from
`skoolkit.ca <http://skoolkit.ca/>`__; the latest development versions can be
found on `GitHub <http://github.com/skoolkid/>`__.
