.. _controlFiles:

Control files
=============
A control file contains a list of start addresses of code and data blocks. This
information can be used by :ref:`sna2skool.py <sna2skool.py>` to organise a
`skool` file into corresponding code and data blocks.

Each block address in a control file is marked with a 'control directive',
which is a single letter that indicates what the block contains:

* ``b`` indicates a data block
* ``c`` indicates a code block
* ``g`` indicates a game status buffer entry
* ``i`` indicates a block that will be ignored
* ``s`` indicates a block containing bytes that are all the same value
  (typically unused zeroes)
* ``t`` indicates a block containing text
* ``u`` indicates an unused block of memory
* ``w`` indicates a block containing words (two-byte values)

(If these letters remind you of the valid characters that may appear in the
first column of each line of a :ref:`skool file <skoolFileFormat>`, that is no
coincidence.)

For example::

  c 24576 Do stuff
  b 24832 Important data
  t 25088 Interesting messages
  u 25344 Unused

This control file declares that:

* Everything before 24576 will be ignored
* There is a routine at 24576-24831 titled 'Do stuff'
* There is data at 24832-25087
* There is text at 25088-25343
* Everything from 25344 onwards is unused (but will still be disassembled as
  data)

Addresses may be written as hexadecimal numbers, too; the equivalent example
control file using hexadecimal notation would be::

  c $6000 Do stuff
  b $6100 Important data
  t $6200 Interesting messages
  u $6300 Unused

Besides the declaration of block types, addresses and titles, the control file
syntax also supports the declaration of the following things:

* Block descriptions
* Register values
* Block start comments
* Mid-block comments
* Block end comments
* Sub-block types and comments
* DEFB/DEFM/DEFW/DEFS statement lengths in data, text and unused sub-blocks
* ASM directives (except block directives)

The syntax for declaring these things is described in the following sections.

Block descriptions
------------------
To provide a description for a code block at 24576 (for example), use the ``D``
directive thus::

  c 24576 This is the title of the routine at 24576
  D 24576 This is the description of the routine at 24576.

If the description consists of two or more paragraphs, declare each one with a
separate ``D`` directive::

  D 24576 This is the first paragraph of the description of the routine at 24576.
  D 24576 This is the second paragraph of the description of the routine at 24576.

Register values
---------------
To declare the values of the registers upon entry to the routine at 24576, add
one line per register with the ``R`` directive thus::

  R 24576 A An important value in the accumulator
  R 24576 DE Display file address

Block start comments
--------------------
To declare a block start comment that will appear above the instruction at
24576, use the ``N`` directive thus::

  N 24576 And so this routine begins.

If the start comment consists of two or more paragraphs, declare each one with
a separate ``N`` directive::

  N 24576 This is the first paragraph of the start comment.
  N 24576 This is the second paragraph of the start comment.

Mid-block comments
------------------
To declare a mid-block comment that will appear above the instruction at 24592,
use the ``N`` directive thus::

  N 24592 The next section of code does something really important.

If the mid-block comment consists of two or more paragraphs, declare each one
with a separate ``N`` directive::

  N 24592 This is the first paragraph of the mid-block comment.
  N 24592 This is the second paragraph of the mid-block comment.

.. note::
   Using the ``D`` directive to declare mid-block comments is deprecated since
   version 4.3. The ``D`` directive should be used only for block descriptions.

Block end comments
------------------
To declare a comment that will appear at the end of the routine at 24576, use
the ``E`` directive thus::

  E 24576 And so the work of this routine is done.

If the block end comment consists of two or more paragraphs, declare each one
with a separate ``E`` directive::

  E 24576 This is the first paragraph of the end comment for the routine at 24576.
  E 24576 This is the second paragraph of the end comment for the routine at 24576.

Sub-block syntax
----------------
Sometimes a block marked as one type (code, data, text, or whatever) may
contain instructions or statements of another type. For example, a word (``w``)
block may contain the odd non-word here and there. To declare such sub-blocks
whose type does not match that of the containing block, use the following
syntax::

  w 32768 A block containing mostly words
  B 32800,3 But here's a sub-block of 3 bytes at 32800
  T 32809,8 And an 8-byte text string at 32809
  C 32821,10 And 10 bytes of code at 32821
  S 32831,17 Followed by 17 zeroes at 32831

The directives (``B``, ``T``, ``C`` and ``S``) used here to mark the sub-blocks
are the upper case equivalents of the directives used to mark top-level blocks
(``b``, ``t``, ``c`` and ``s``). The comments at the end of these sub-block
declarations are taken as instruction-level comments and will appear as such in
the resultant `skool` file.

If an instruction-level comment spans a group of two or more sub-blocks of
different types, it must be declared with an ``M`` directive::

  M 40000,21 This comment covers the following 3 sub-blocks
  B 40000,3
  W 40003,10
  T 40013,8

If the length parameter is omitted from an ``M`` directive, the comment is
assumed to cover all sub-blocks from the given start address to the end of the
top-level block.

Three bits of sub-block syntax left. First,  the blank sub-block directive::

  c 24576 A great routine
    24580,11 A great section of code at 24580

This is equivalent to::

  c 24576 A great routine
  C 24580,11 A great section of code at 24580

That is, the the type of a blank sub-block directive is taken to be the same as
that of the parent block.

Next, the address range::

  c 24576 A great routine
    24580-24590 A great section of code at 24580

This is equivalent to::

  c 24576 A great routine
    24580,11 A great section of code at 24580

That is, you can specify the extent of a sub-block using either an address
range, or an address and a length.

Finally, the implicit sub-block extent::

  c 24576 A great routine
    24580 A great section of code at 24580
    24588,10 Another great section of code at 24590

This is equivalent to::

  c 24576 A great routine
    24580,8 A great section of code at 24580
    24588,10 Another great section of code at 24588

But the declaration of the length (8) of the sub-block at 24580 is redundant,
because the sub-block is implicitly terminated by the declaration of the
sub-block at 24588 that follows. This is exactly how top-level block
declarations work: each top-level block is implicitly terminated by the
declaration of the next one.

Sub-block lengths
-----------------
Normally, a ``B`` sub-block declared thus::

  B 24580,12 Interesting data

would result in something like this in the corresponding skool file::

  24580 DEFB 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 ; {Interesting data
  24588 DEFB 9,10,11,12      ; }

But what if you wanted to split the data in this sub-block into groups of 3
bytes each? That can be achieved with::

  B 24580,12,3 Interesting data

which would give::

  24580 DEFB 1,2,3    ; {Interesting data
  24583 DEFB 4,5,6
  24586 DEFB 7,8,9
  24589 DEFB 10,11,12 ; }

That is, in a ``B`` directive, the desired DEFB statement lengths may be given
as a comma-separated list of numbers following the sub-block length parameter,
and the final number in the list is used for all remaining data in the block.
So, for example::

  B 24580,12,1,2,3 Interesting data

would give::

  24580 DEFB 1        ; {Interesting data
  24581 DEFB 2,3
  24583 DEFB 4,5,6
  24586 DEFB 7,8,9
  24589 DEFB 10,11,12 ; }

If the statement length list contains sequences of two or more identical
lengths, as in::

  B 24580,21,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,3

then it may be abbreviated thus::

  B 24580,21,2*6,1*3,3

The same syntax can be used for ``S``, ``T``, ``W`` sub-blocks too. For
example::

  S 32768,100,25 Four 25-byte chunks of zeroes

would give::

  32768 DEFS 25 ; {Four 25-byte chunks of zeroes
  32793 DEFS 25
  32818 DEFS 25
  32843 DEFS 25 ; }

DEFB and DEFM statements may contain both bytes and strings; for example::

  40000 DEFM "Hi ",5
  40004 DEFB 4,"go"

Such statements can be encoded in a control file thus::

  T 40000,4,3:B1
  B 40004,3,1:T2

That is, the length of a string in a DEFB statement is prefixed by ``T``, the
length of a sequence of bytes in a DEFM statement is prefixed by ``B``, and the
lengths of all strings and byte sequences are separated by colons. This
notation can also be combined with the '*' notation; for example::

  T 50000,8,2:B2*2

which is equivalent to::

  T 50000,8,2:B2,2:B2

DEFS statements may specify a byte value other than zero; for example::

  60000 DEFS 20,170
  60020 DEFS 40,85

These statements can be encoded in a control file thus::

  S 60000,60,20:170,40:85

.. _ctlLoops:

Loops
-----
Sometimes the instructions and statements in a code or data block follow a
repeating pattern. For example::

  b 30000 Two bytes and one word, times ten
  B 30000,2
  W 30002
  B 30004,2
  W 30004
  ...
  B 30036,2
  W 30038

Repeating patterns like this can be expressed more succinctly as a loop by
using the ``L`` directive, which has the following format::

  L start,length,count[,blocks]

where:

* ``start`` is the loop start address
* ``length`` is the length of the loop (the size of the address range to
  repeat)
* ``count`` is the number of times to repeat the loop (only values of 2 or more
  make sense)
* ``blocks`` is ``1`` to repeat block-level elements, or ``0`` to repeat only
  sub-block elements (default: ``0``)

So using the ``L`` directive, the body of the data block above can be expressed
in three lines instead of 20::

  b 30000 Two bytes and one word, times ten
  B 30000,2
  W 30002
  L 30000,4,10

The ``L`` directive can also be used to repeat entire blocks, by setting the
``blocks`` argument to ``1``. For example::

  b 40000 A block of five pairs of bytes
  B 40000,10,2
  L 40000,10,3,1

is equivalent to::

  b 40000 A block of five pairs of bytes
  B 40000,10,2
  b 40010 A block of five pairs of bytes
  B 40010,10,2
  b 40020 A block of five pairs of bytes
  B 40020,10,2

Note that ASM directives in the address range of an ``L`` directive loop are
*not* repeated.

Number bases
------------
Numeric values in DEFB, DEFM, DEFS and DEFW statements are normally rendered in
either decimal or hexadecimal, depending on the options passed to
:ref:`sna2skool.py`. To force a numeric value to be rendered in a specific
base, attach a ``b`` (binary), ``d`` (decimal) or ``h`` (hexadecimal) prefix to
the statement length.

For example::

  B 40000,8,b1:d2:h1,d1,b1,h2

will result in something like this in the corresponding skool file::

  40000 DEFB %10101010,23,43,$5F
  40004 DEFB 56
  40005 DEFB %11110000
  40006 DEFB $2B,$80

ASM directives
--------------
To declare an ASM directive for a block or an individual instruction, use the
``@`` directive thus::

  @ address directive[=value]

where:

* ``directive`` is the directive name
* ``address`` is the address of the block or instruction to which the directive
  applies
* ``value`` is the value of the directive (if it requires one)

For example, to declare a :ref:`label` directive for the instruction at 32768::

  @ 32768 label=LOOP

When declaring an :ref:`ignoreua` directive for anything other than an
instruction-level comment, a suffix must be appended to the directive to
specify the type of comment it applies to::

  @ address ignoreua:X

where ``X`` is one of:

* ``d`` - entry description
* ``e`` - block end comment
* ``i`` - instruction-level comment (default)
* ``m`` - block start comment or mid-block comment
* ``r`` - register description section
* ``t`` - entry title

For example, to declare an :ref:`ignoreua` directive for the description of the
routine at 49152::

  @ 49152 ignoreua:d
  D 49152 This is the description of the routine at 49152.

Note that neither ASM block directives (such as the :ref:`bfixBlockDirectives`)
nor the exact location of :ref:`org`, :ref:`writer`, :ref:`start`, :ref:`end`
and :ref:`set` directives can be preserved in a control file.

.. note::
   The old style of declaring ASM directives (``; @directive:address[=value]``)
   is deprecated since version 4.3.

Instruction-level comments
--------------------------
One limitation of storing instruction-level comments as shown so far is that
there is no way to distinguish between a blank comment that spans two or more
instructions and no comment at all. For example, both::

  30000 DEFB 0 ; {
  30001 DEFB 0 ; }

and::

  30000 DEFB 0 ;
  30001 DEFB 0 ;

would be preserved thus::

  B 30000,2,1

To solve this problem, a special syntax is used to preserve blank
multi-instruction comments::

  B 30000,2,1 .

When restored, this comment is reduced to an empty string.

But how then to preserve a multi-instruction comment consisting of a single dot
(``.``), or a sequence of two or more dots? In that case, another dot is
prefixed to the comment. So::

  30000 DEFB 0 ; {...
  30001 DEFB 0 ; }

is preserved thus::

  B 30000,2,1 ....

Note that this scheme does not apply to multi-instruction comments that contain
at least one character other than a dot; such comments are preserved verbatim
(that is, without a dot prefix).

Control file comments
---------------------
A comment may be added to a control file by starting a line with a hash
character (``#``), a per cent sign (``%``), or a semicolon - so long as the
next non-whitespace character is not ``@``, because ``; @`` is the deprecated
(but still valid) way to declare an ASM directive. For example::

  # This is a comment
  % This is another comment
  ; This is yet another comment

Limitations
-----------
A control file can be useful in the early stages of developing a `skool` file
for reorganising code and data blocks, but it cannot preserve the following:

* ASM block directives
* the exact locations of :ref:`org`, :ref:`writer`, :ref:`start`, :ref:`end`
  and :ref:`set` directives
* :ref:`data definition entries <dEntry>` ('d' blocks) and
  :ref:`remote entries <rEntry>` ('r' blocks)
* comments that are not part of a code or data block

:ref:`skoolFileTemplates`, however, can preserve all of these elements, and so
may be a better choice for `skool` files that contain any of them.
