        PyParadox is a nix launcher for Paradox titles.
        
        * Free software: GPLv3+
        * Documentation: https://pyparadox.readthedocs.org.
        * Source code: https://gitlab.com/carmenbbakker/pyparadox
        * PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyparadox
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Cross-platform: Linux, OS X and Windows.
        * Supports Python 3.3+ with PyQt5.
        * Games: PyParadox supports all cross-platform grand strategy titles of
          Paradox Interactive that use the Clausewitz engine. To date, these include:
          - Crusader Kings II
          - Europa Universalis IV
        * Steam: PyParadox can be launched from Steam when starting the title from the
          Steam interface. All Steam integration should work just fine. A small
          configuration inside Steam is required to make sure that PyParadox is used
          instead of the stock launcher. See the documentatation on how to set this up.
        * PyParadox separates the expansion DLCs from the regular DLCs. This should
          make it easier to start up your game with the exact expansions you want.
        * PyParadox fixes an anomaly under Linux that causes the game to mess with
          the screen resolution when alt+tabbing. This anomaly was introduced when
          Paradox released their (new) stock launcher for Linux. By bypassing this
          launcher, PyParadox also bypasses the anomaly.
        
        
        
        
        History
        -------
        
        0.2.1 (2015-04-11)
        --------------------
        
        * Minor patches to documentation because apparently I can't release anything
          without messing that stuff up.
        
        0.2.0 (2015-04-11)
        ---------------------
        
        * Complete rewrite of the project, with reuse of some code.
        * Now no longer supports Python 2.7 and Qt 4. This program will only work with
          Python 3.3+ and PyQt5.
        * Configuration files relocated to a different location. Old configuration
          files no longer valid.
        * Graphical user interface makes use of Qt .ui files, rather than hardcoded
          QtGui/QtWidgets code.
        * A lot of functionality has been decoupled from the user interface. While the
          UI code performs *some* glue logic, it should be relatively trivial to cook
          up a user interface in a different framework. An experimental QML front-end
          is under consideration.
        * Unit tests are a lot leaner, using fewer mocks and patches, instead relying
          much more on dependency injection.
        * Documentation rewritten.
        
        0.1.3 (2015-01-31)
        ---------------------
        
        * Added --pyqt4 argument to force the usage of PyQt4.
        * Fixed PyQt4 compatibility issues.
        
        0.1.2 (2014-07-20)
        ---------------------
        
        * Fixed typo that caused README to display incorrectly.
        
        0.1.1 (2014-07-20)
        ---------------------
        
        * Sweetened up the README with images of the program.
        
        0.1.0 (2014-07-20)
        ---------------------
        
        * Added descriptive error message when game fails to run.
        * Added experimental PyQt4 support.
        * Detailed installation instructions per platform added.
        * A logo of each game is now displayed.
        * Mods and DLCs are now sorted.
        * The application now has an icon.
        
        0.0.2 (2014-07-13)
        ---------------------
        
        * Windows compatibility added.
        * Window titles set correctly.
        * Small UI tweaks (alt-shortcuts).
        * Better game process management.
        * Better unit testing, though incomplete.
        * Just general code refactoring.
        * Tested on Kubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8.1.  Still not sure about OS X.
        
        0.0.1 (2014-07-10)
        ---------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
        * Basic functionality.  No polish yet.
        * Only tested on Kubuntu 14.04.
