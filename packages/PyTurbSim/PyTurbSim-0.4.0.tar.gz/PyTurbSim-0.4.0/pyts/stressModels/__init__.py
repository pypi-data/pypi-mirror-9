This is the PyTurbSim 'stress models' package.

For more information or to use this package import the stressModels.api
package, e.g.:

>>> import pyts.stressModels.api as rm

**Currently the stress package does not function properly, unless no coherence is used.  Fixing this is near the top of the list of things to repair in PyTurbSim.**
