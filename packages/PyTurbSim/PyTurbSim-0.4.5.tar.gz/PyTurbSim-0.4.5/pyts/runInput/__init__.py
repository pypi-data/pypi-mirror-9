This is the PyTurbSim package that provides tools for emulating
O-TurbSim functionality. In particular it contains functions for
taking a TurbSim 'input' file (.inp) and performing a TurbSim run that
matches that file.

Example usage
-------------
See either:
 1) the `pyTurbSim.py` executable script in the PyTurbSim root directory
 2) The :mod:`pyts.runInput.main` docstring for example usage.
