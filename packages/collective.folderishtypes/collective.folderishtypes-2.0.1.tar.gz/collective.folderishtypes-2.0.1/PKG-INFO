Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Provides the types "Folderish Event", "Folderish News Item" and
        "Folderish Document" as replacements for their ATContentTypes equivalents.
        Those types are able to hold any other content, like a Folder.
        
        There is a "portlet" profile, which installs a portlet to show the contents of
        an folderish type.
        
        You can limit the types, which can be added to FolderishTypes by providing
        a Generic Setup import type configuration.
        
        The reason for this package is, that in my experience it's easier to group
        related content together at one place. An article about something fancy might
        have an image gallery associated with it as well as some pdf-downloads. With
        this package you can put everyting inside the article.
        Another use case is that you can structure content hierarchically and don't need
        to define "default pages" - a concept hard to understand and handle (see:
        http://www.sixfeetup.com/blog/plone-vs.-drupal-core-features-comparison )
        
        Alexander Limi also wished folderish content back in 2008:
        "#10: Content re-use is overrated â€” people like folderish"
        http://limi.net/articles/18-things-i-wish-were-true-about-plone/
        
        To use ``collective.folderishtypes`` with Archetypes, depend on the
        ``dexterity`` ``extras_require`` in setup.py or buildout like so::
        
            collective.folderishtypes [archetypes]
        
        For the dexterity version, like so::
        
            collective.folderishtypes [dexterity]
        
        
        How to migrate Products.PloneArticle documents to Folderish Document
        ====================================================================
        
        A upgrade step "PloneArticle to Folderish Document"	in the
        collective.folderishtypes default profile for migrating PloneArticle objects to
        Folderish Document objects is provided. Note, this does not cover
        PloneArticleMultiPage at the moment.
        
        
        How to migrate non-folderishtypes to folderish ones
        ===================================================
        
        Non-folderish content types are missing some btree attributes, which folderish
        content types have (See ``Products.BtreeFolder2.BTreeFolder2Base._initBtrees``
        ).
        
        plone.app.folder provides an upgrade view to migrate pre-plone.app.folder (or
        non-folderish) types to the new Btree based implementation (defined in:
        ``plone.app.folder.migration.BTreeMigrationView``).
        
        To upgrade your non-folderish content types to folderish ones, just call
        ``@@migrate-btrees`` on your Plone site root, and you're done.
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        - Depend on z3c.jbot, so that overriding folder_listing and folder_summary_view
          might also work at IPloneSite root.
        - Write tests
        - See, if this portlet is useful:

        Changes
        =======
        
        2.0.1 (2015-04-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix redirection to parent context after editing for Archetypes. We cannot
          import something from Acquisition in a Filesystem script.
          [thet]
        
        
        2.0 (2015-03-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Plone 5 + 4 safe call of the ``@@folder_listing`` ``listing_macro``.
          [thet]
        
        - Provide a ``redirectparent.zcml`` file. When loading it the user is
          redirected to the parent folder after adding or editing. This avoids
          confusing behavior of creating nested content structures, while one might add
          multiple content items to one folder. For consistency reasons, this is done
          for all types.
          For Archetypes, this behavior is enabled by default.
          [thet]
        
        - Add a browserlayer for collective.folderishtypes including the .at and .dx
          sub packages together with upgrade steps. Bind relevant browser views to
          these browser layers.
          [thet]
        
        - Allow "Site Administrator" to add ATContentTypes based Folderish Content
          Types.
          [thet]
        
        - Better PloneArticle migration: Set content_type and filename for files and
          images. Plus: migrate contentleadimage, if available.
          [thet]
        
        - Update unsintall profiles.
          [thet]
        
        
        2.0b2 (2014-10-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix broken release
          [rnix]
        
        
        2.0b1 (2014-10-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Add ISelectableConstrainTypes to behaviors of Dexterity folderish types.
          [agitator]
        
        - Add content listing viewlet.
          [agitator]
        
        - Add migration step for Products.PloneArticle objects to Archetypes based
          foldersh document objects.
          [thet]
        
        - Initialize permissions and roles for Archetypes foldersh types.
          [thet]
        
        - Dexterity support.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.8 (2013-11-23)
        ----------------
        
        - In folder_summary_view do a more sane check, if an image is available.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.7 (2013-08-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Remove bobo_traverse in Foldersh News Item, since plone.app.imaging does the
          traversing.
          [thet]
        
        - Remove vCalendar action entry from FTI config of Folderish Event.
          [thet]
        
        - More documentation: How To create own content types based on
          collective.folderishtypes, How to migrate non-folderishtypes to folderish
          ones.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.6 (2013-04-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Update translations and translate folder_listing.
          [thet]
        
        - Add z3c.autoinclude.plugin entry point.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.5 (2012-11-30)
        ----------------
        
        - Let the folderish types derive from Products.ATContentTypes ATFolder instead
          of plone.app.folder's implementation. It inherits some i18n classes. This
          fixes the issue that on translation of folderish types LinguaPlone's
          translation view wasn't shown.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.4 (2012-11-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Give the original, non-folderish types another title, so that they can be
          easily kept apart from the folderish ones.
          [thet]
        
        - For folderish events, move the location field back to the main schemata.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.3 (2012-11-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Allow discussions from plone.app.discussion on Folderish Types.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.2.1 (2012-09-06)
        ------------------
        
        - CSS fix
          [rnix]
        
        
        1.2 (2012-09-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed folderish=True when finalizing the schema, which prevented
          relateditems from being displayed. Updated import to plone.app.folder.
          [agitator]
        
        - Fix meta types in FTI to follow consistent conventions.
          [rnixx]
        
        - For Folderish Event, use plone.app.event's ATEvent implementation if
          available.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.1.1 (2012-02-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Add a custom style class for the contextual contents portlet based on the
          portlet's name.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.1 (2012-02-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Add a contextual contents portlet, which shows the contents of folderish
          types in a portlet.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.0 (2012-02-02)

        - Add HistroyAwareMixin and configure types to be versionable.
          [thet]
        
        - Remove folderish_listing_viewlet, since there is already a portlet which can
          be used.
          [thet]
        
        - Include CSS via link instead of import, which can then be better processed by
          XML manipulation tools like Deliverance or Diazo.
          [thet]
        
        - More explicit content-icons background styles which don't override
          background-color.
          [thet]
        
        - Use plone.app.imaging scales - apply a schema patch to FolderishNewsItem.
          [thet]
        
        - Fixed traversing to image scales for FolderishNewsItem. Subclasses should
          implement __bobo_traverse__ too.
