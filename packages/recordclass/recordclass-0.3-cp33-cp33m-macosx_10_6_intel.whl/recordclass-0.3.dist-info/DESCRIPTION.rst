===========

**recordclass** is an `MIT Licensed <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ python library.
It implements the type ``mutabletuple`` and factory function ``recordclass`` 
in order to create record-like classes. 

* ``mutabletuple`` is specialization of the ``tuple`` type that make it "mutable". 
* ``recordclass`` is a factory function that create subclass of ``mutabletuple``. 
  It's the analog of ``collection.namedtuple`` factory function.

This library actually is a "proof of concept" for the problem of "mutable" 
alternative of ``namedtuple``.

Main repository for ``recordclass`` 
is on `bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/intellimath/recordclass>`_.
