        ==========================
        
        *Get version from version control instead of hardcoding it into setup.py*
        
        introduction
        ------------
        
        Instead of hardcoding the version in setup.py like this:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            setup(
                name='some-dist-name',
                version='1.0',
                ...)
        
        This package allows specifying a VCS command like this:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            setup(
                name='some-dist-name',
                version_command='git describe',
                ...)
        
        ...Which will then update the version into some-dist-name.egg-info/version.txt,
        so that the version can also be found if setup.py is being run from a sdist
        or something.
        
        When it can find the version from either some-dist-name.egg-info/version.txt
        or the output of the version_command, it will update the version key that is
        normally used for the version, such as what's used in the sdist filename and
        so on.
        
        setup keyword
        -------------
        
        Instead of specifying the ``version`` keyword argument, specify the ``version_command``
        keyword argument. It can either be a str or a tuple. If it's a str, it's interpreted
        as just the command to execute, for example ``git describe``. If it's a tuple, it must
        have two elements, the first must be the command, and the second specifies how to
        adapt the version string to PEP440 and must one have one of the following values:
        
        ``None``
            Do nothing, ignore PEP440 and accept that pip/setuptools will throw warnings
        ``pep440-git-local``
            Change ``"1.2.3-10-abc1234"``  to ``"1.2.3+git-10-abc1234"``
        ``pep440-git-dev`` or ``pep440-git``
            Change ``"1.2.3-10-abc1234"`` to ``"1.2.3.dev10"``
        
        installation
        ------------
        
        To use it, just do this::
        
            pip install setuptools-version-command
        
        With the pip of the global python. (Or use ``--user``.)
        
        testing
        -------
        
        To test it, run ``./setup.py --version``.
        
        developing
        ----------
        
        Within a checkout of this repo:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            virtualenv env
            env/bin/pip install --editable .
            env/bin/python setup.py --version
        
        Make sure that you change the setup.py so that it actually makes use of setuptools-version-command.
