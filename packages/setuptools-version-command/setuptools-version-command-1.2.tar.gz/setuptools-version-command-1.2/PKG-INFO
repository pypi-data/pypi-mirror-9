Description: setuptools-version-command -- get version from VCS
        
        Instead of hardcoding the version in setup.py like this:
        
            setup(
                name='some-dist-name',
                version='1.0',
                ...)
        
        This package allows specifying a VCS command like this:
        
            setup(
                name='some-dist-name',
                version_command='git describe')
        
        Which will then update the version into some-dist-name.egg-info/version.txt,
        so that the version can also be found if setup.py is being run from a sdist
        or something.
        
        When it can find the version from either some-dist-name.egg-info/version.txt
        or the output of the version_command, it will update the version key that is
        normally used for the version, such as what's used in the sdist filename and
        so on.
        
        SETUP KEYWORDS
        
        version_command: the command to execute to obtain a version.
            example: 'git describe'
        
        version_command_pep440: whether to make output compliant with PEP 440
            (instead of the other way around...)
            valid values:
                'git' or 
                'git-local' : transform '1.2-3-abc1234' to '1.2+git-3-abc1234'
                'git-dev'   : transform '1.2-3-abc1234' to '1.2.dev3'
            default is None, which means do nothing.
        
        INSTALLATION
        
        To use it, just do this:
        
            pip install setuptools-version-command
