This exporter can be used to backup the collection of an Rdio user. It
includes a command-line utility script and a library for bundling into
your own applications.

Requirements
------------

- requests
- requests_oauthlib

Installing
----------

::

    $ pip install python-rdio-export

You can (optionally) provide your Rdio credentials via a global config
file located in `~/.rdioconfig` with the format:

::

    [Rdio]
    rdioConsumerKey=your_api_key
    rdioConsumerSecret=your_api_secret

Alternatively, you can provide your Rdio credentials via two environment
variables:

::

    $ export RDIO_CONSUMER_KEY=your_api_key
    $ export RDIO_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_api_secret

..

    Note: These environment variables will only be consumed by the rdio-export
    script and can be overridden through the use of the script flags
    :code:`--key` and :code:`--secret`.

Export by username:

::

    $ rdio-export --user twaddington

Export by email:
