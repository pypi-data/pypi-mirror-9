        allows your editors to easily collaborate on a Plone document by adding
        annotations (inline comments) on it.

        Install
        =======
        
        - Add eea.annotator to your eggs section in your buildout and re-run buildout.
          You can download a sample buildout from
          https://github.com/eea/eea.annotator/tree/master/buildouts/plone4
        - Install eea.annotator within Site Setup > Add-ons
        
        .. warning ::
        
          Once you'll install this add-on via Site Setup > Add-ons, it will
          overrides Publish Traversal for Archetypes base object
          (plone.app.imaging.interfaces.IBaseObject) and Dexterity Base Content
          (plone.dexterity.interfaces.IDexterityContent) in order to handle custom
          annotator URLs. Still, it preserves old functionality from plone.app.imaging
          and plone.dexterity (also eea.depiction) but if you have custom traversals
          registered for these interfaces, try to use custom browser layers when
          registering them (see: eea.annotator.browser.app.traverse).
        
        **Plone version dependency**
        
        eea.annotator does not have a hard dependency on Plone 4.3, however, it has
        been built around plone.app.jquery version 1.7.2 which is shipped by default
        with Plone 4.3. If you wish to use the product on an older version of Plone,
        you could pin the plone.app.jquery version to 1.7.2.
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        1. Go to Plone Site Setup > EEA Annotator Settings and enable inline comments
           for your content-types (default enabled for Page);
        2. Go to your work-space within Plone Site and add a new object (Page) or user
           an existing one;
        3. In view mode select text you want to comment on and add an inline comment;
        4. Within edit form > Settings Tab you can contextually disable inline comments.
        5. You can also add an "Inline comments" portlet in order to overview
           all inline comments on this page.
        
        Moderate inline comments
        ========================
        .. warning ::
        
           You'll have to be logged-in ad Manager or have the
           **eea.annotator: Manage** permission
        
        1. Click on the title of the **Inline comments portlet** if any or just access
           **@@moderate-inline-comments**
        
        Dexterity
        ---------
        Dexterity content-types are supported by EEA Annotator.
        
        1. In order to be able to contextually disable inline comments you need to add
           a boolean field called disableAnnotator within your Dexterity content-type
           schema fields.
        2. In order to be able to contextually make inline comments read-only
           you need to add a boolean field called readOnlyAnnotator within your
           Dexterity content-type schema fields.
           (Plone Site Setup > Dexterity Content Types > MyCustomType > Fields)
