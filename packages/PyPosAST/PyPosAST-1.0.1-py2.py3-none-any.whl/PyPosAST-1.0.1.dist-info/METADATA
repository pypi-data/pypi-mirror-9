PyPosAST
========

This project extends Python ast nodes with positional informations, such
as where the ast node starts and finishes in the code. This allows us to
skip using the Python inconsistent lineno and col\_offset

I (João Felipe Pimentel) started this library to help me with ast
analysis on `noWorkflow <https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow>`__

Installing and using PyPosAST is simple and easy. Please check our
installation and basic usage guidelines below.

Quick Installation
------------------

To install PyPosAST, you should follow these basic instructions:

If you have pip, just run:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pyposast

If you do not have pip, but already have Git (to clone our repository)
and Python:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:JoaoFelipe/pyposast.git
    $ cd pyposast
    $ ./setup.py install

This installs PyPosAST on your system.

Usage
-----

Just use the 'parse' from pyposast it instead of ast.parse:

.. code:: python

    import pyposast
    code = ("variable = 1234\n"
            "if variable:\n"
            "    result = 2 + 2\n"
            "else:\n"
            "    result = 1")
    tree = pyposast.parse(code, filename='__main__', mode='exec')

This will add the fields first\_line, first\_col, last\_line, last\_col,
uid, op\_pos to the nodes as following:

::

    Module -> first_line=1, first_col=0, last_line=5, last_col=14, uid=(5, 14)
      body[0]=Assign: firts_line=1, first_col=0, last_line=1, last_col=15, uid=(1, 15)
        targets[0]=Name: id='variable', first_line=1, firts_col=0, last_line=1, last_col=8, uid=(1, 8)
        op_pos[0]=Node: first_line=1, first_col=9, last_line=1, last_col=10, uid=(1, 10)
        value=Num: n=1234, first_line=1, first_col=11, last_line=1, last_col=15, uid=(1, 15)
      body[1]=If: first_line=2, first_col=0, last_line=5, last_col=14, uid=(2, 2)
        test=Name: id='variable', first_line=2, first_col=3, last_line=2, last_col=11, uid=(2, 11)
        body[0]=Assign: first_line=3, first_col=4, last_line=3, last_col=20, uid=(3, 20)
          targets[0]=Name: id='result', first_line=3, first_col=4, last_line=3, last_col=10, uid=(3, 10)
          op_pos[0]=Node: first_line=3, first_col=11, last_line=3, last_col=12, uid=(3, 12)
          value=BinOp: first_line=3, first_col=13, last_line=3, last_col=18, uid=(3, 18)
            op=Add()
            left=Num: n=2, first_line=3, first_col=13, last_line=3, last_col=14, uid=(3, 14)
            right=Num: n=2, first_line=3, first_col=17, last_line=3, last_col=18, uid=(3, 18)
            op_pos=Node: first_line=3, first_col=15, last_line=3, last_col=16, uid=(3, 16)
        orelse[0]=Assign: first_line=5, first_col=4, last_line=5, last_col=14, uid=(5, 14)
          targets[0]=Name: id='result', first_line=5, first_col=4, last_line=5, last_col=10, uid=(5, 10)
          op_pos[0]=Node: first_line=5, first_col=11, last_line=5, last_col=12, uid=(5, 12)
          value=Num: n=1, first_line=5, first_col=13, last_line=5, last_col=14, uid=(5, 14)

The resulting tree can be used as usual with any AST visitor
