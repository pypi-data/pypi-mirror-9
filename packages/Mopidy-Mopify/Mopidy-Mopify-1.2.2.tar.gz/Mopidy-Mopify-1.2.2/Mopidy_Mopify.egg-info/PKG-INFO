        Mopify is a web client for [Mopidy](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy). Instead
        of most other Mopidy web clients, Mopify aims to provide a complete music
        experience.
        
        Some of the features that are included in Mopify:
        
        - Discover the newest releases and featured playlists.
        - Get music recommendations based on the music you've listened to.
        - **Manage your Spotify Library (playlists, artists, albums, songs)**
        - Start music stations from artists, albums, tracks, playlists or your personal
          taste profile.
        
        At the moment, Mopify only works with
        [mopidy-spotify](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify). This may change in
        the future depending on how popular Mopify becomes!

        ## Installation
        
        Installing Mopify is easy. Make sure you have installed Mopidy 0.19 and
        Mopidy-Spotify 1.2 (or higher) and enabled the [HTTP
        Extension](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/ext/http/).
        
        Install using PIP:
        
        ```bash
        sudo pip install Mopidy-Mopify
        ```
        
        After installing Mopify, you can enable it by adding the following options to
        your Mopidy config file (optional):
        
        ```
        [mopify]
        enabled = true
        ```
        
        ### Updating
        
        Mopify will notify you when a new version is available. To update Mopify to its
        new version you can use the following command:
        
        ```bash
        sudo pip install --upgrade Mopidy-Mopify
        ```
        
        ## Getting started
        
        To get started with Mopify, check out the
        [Wiki](https://github.com/dirkgroenen/mopidy-mopify/wiki).
        
        After installing the Mopidy client, you can use a modern browser (like Firefox
        or Chrome) to access it using your server IP and Mopidy web port. For example:
        `http://192.168.1.2:6680/mopify/`.

        ## Developing
        
        Nodejs, Grunt and Bower are development dependencies of Mopify. You'll need to
        install these programs in order to build and contribute to Mopify.
        
        ### How to Develop
        
        Before you can start developing, you'll have to install some programs and clone
        the repo to your local machine.
        
        1. Install Nodejs
        2. Install grunt-cli and bower: `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
        3. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:dirkgroenen/mopidy-mopify.git`
        4. Install dependencies: `npm install && bower install`
        
        You're now ready to start developing. To start the build, watch process and a
        web server run:
        
        ```bash
        grunt watch
        ```
        
        This will start a web server running on port `8000`.
        
        When you change the files in the `/src/` directory, grunt will automatically
        rebuild and lint the project.
        
        ### Deploy
        
        When you want to deploy your changed version, you have to run `grunt package`.
        This will create a new `Mopidy-Mopify` web extension package.
