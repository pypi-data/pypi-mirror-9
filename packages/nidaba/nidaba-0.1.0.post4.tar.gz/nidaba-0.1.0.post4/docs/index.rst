Welcome
=======

Iris is an open source distributed optical character recognition pipeline that
makes it easy to preprocess and OCR scans of text documents in a multitude of
ways. Iris builds upon the celery distributed task queue to provide a
lightweight task queue that performs reasonably well across a wide spectrum of
use cases.

To get started with iris, first read :ref:`The Iris Architecture
<understanding_iris>` then use :ref:`Installing Iris <installing_iris>` to
start provisioning your pipeline. :ref:`Using Iris <using_iris>` describes
different ways to use the pipeline.

The full documentation tree can be seen :ref:`here <toctree>`.
