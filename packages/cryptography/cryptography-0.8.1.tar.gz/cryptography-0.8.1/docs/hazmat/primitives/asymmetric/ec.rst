Elliptic Curves
---------------

Elliptic curves provide equivalent security at much smaller key sizes than
asymmetric cryptography systems such as RSA or DSA. For some operations they
can also provide higher performance at every security level. According to NIST
they can have as much as a `64x lower computational cost than DH`_.

.. note::
    Curves with a size of `less than 224 bits`_ should not be used. You should
    strongly consider using curves of at least 224 bits.

Generally the NIST prime field ("P") curves are significantly faster than the
other types suggested by NIST at both signing and verifying with ECDSA.

Prime fields also `minimize the number of security concerns for elliptic-curve
cryptography`_. However there is `some concern`_ that both the prime field and
binary field ("B") NIST curves may have been weakened during their generation.

Currently `cryptography` only supports NIST curves, none of which are
considered "safe" by the `SafeCurves`_ project run by Daniel J. Bernstein and
Tanja Lange.

All named curves are providers of :class:`EllipticCurve`.
