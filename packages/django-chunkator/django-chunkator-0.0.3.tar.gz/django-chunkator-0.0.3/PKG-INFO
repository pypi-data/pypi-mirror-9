        ================
        
        
        Chunk large querysetsinto small chunks, and iterate over them without killing
        your RAM.
        
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/novafloss/django-chunkator.svg
        
        Usage::
        
            from chunkator import chunkator
            for item in chunkator(LargeModel.objects.all(), 200):
                do_something(item)
        
        This tool is intended to work on Django querysets.
        Your model **must** define a pk field (this is done by default, but sometimes
        it can be overridden) and this pk has to be unique. ``django-chunkator`` has
        been tested with Postgresql and SQLite, using regular PKs and UUIDs as primary
        keys.
        
        Warning:
        
        * This will not **accelerate** your process. Instead of having one BIG query,
          you'll have several small queries. This will save your RAM instead, because
          you'll not load a huge queryset result before looping on it.
