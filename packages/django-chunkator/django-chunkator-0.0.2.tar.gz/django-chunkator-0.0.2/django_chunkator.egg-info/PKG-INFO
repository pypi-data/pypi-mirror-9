        Chunk large querysetsinto small chunks, and iterate over them without killing
        your RAM.

        Usage::
        
            from chunkator import chunkator
            for item in chunkator(LargeModel.objects.all(), 200):
                do_something(item)
        
        This tool is intended to work on Django querysets.
        
        Warnings:
        
        * This toolkit will only work if your models use "pk" as their primary key
          **and** that this primary key is an integer (no UUID, or such),
        * This will not **accelerate** your process. Instead of having one BIG query,
          you'll have several small queries. This will save your RAM instead, because
          you'll not load a huge queryset result before looping on it.
