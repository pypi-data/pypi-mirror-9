The Python3 Package Creator.

Pypc generates standard scaffolding and environment for a Python package.

* Populates the directory structure show in `Usage`
* --strict Installs virtualenv + creates venv directory
* Installs pyflakes, pep8 to venv

Installation
============

    $ pip install pypc

Usage
=====
Pypc can be used to create the basic structure of your python
package. It uses the conventions and file structure outlined in
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html. Options also
exist to setup virtualenv, pip install dependencies and linters, such
as pyflakes and pep8, and generate a pip freeze as requirements.txt.

    $ pypc project && ls

    CHANGES  docs/  examples/  LICENSE  MANIFEST.in  project/  README.md  setup.py  tox.in

Alternatively, you can run in minimal mode with -m or --minimal. This
only creates a README and setup.py and does not require network access
(after pypc is installed).

    # Minimal install

    $ pypc -m project && ls

    project/  MANIFEST.in  README.rst  setup.py setup.cfg

In both cases, a project/ subdirectory is populated with an __init__.py.

Finally, pypc provides a strict mode which installs and configures
virtualenv and specified linters as dependencies. This may be combined
with minimal mode:

    $ pypc -sm project

Options
=======

    usage: pypc [-h] [-v] [-m] [-s] [--venv VENV] [--path PATH] [--author AUTHOR]
                [--email EMAIL] [-V VERSION] [--desc DESC] [--url URL]
                [--rm README] [--fs FS]
                pkgname

If you only want to create a package with a setup.py (no virtual env,
etc), use the -m or --minimal flag.

Note: -v outputs the version of pypc whereas -V or --version is used to
 specify the initial version of the package you are creating. This is
 slightly confusion, and improvements are welcome.

Library
=======
Pypc can be imported and used as library.

    >>> from pypc.create import Package
    >>> p = Package("pkgname", path="~/optional") # defaults to os.getcwd()
    >>> p.new(**{'readme': 'README.md'}) # see pypc.settings.DEFAULTS for a list of default options (key,vals)

Philosopy
=========
* KISS. Small and simple enough (i.e. Flask/webpy, not django) that it can be integrated into pip,
* Defaults. a default modus of operandi which works offline,
* PEP 20. "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." In this respect, the general file structure should remain static and accept overrides/overloading of templates and if specific modules/packages (like flask) require specific (additional) file structure, a builder can import/bootstrap using pypc (as it would pip)

Questions for you
=================
1) Does the file structure pypc generates break any conventions?
2) Is the code for pypc readable/accessible?
3) Feature suggestions? (would love to auto-init venv)

Disclaimer
==========
Pypc is a pre-alpha proof of concept. It's slow as it installs pyflakes, pep8, virtualenv sets up a virtualenv, and then generates a freeze list of requirements).
Right now there is little to no test-coverage; being it is a proof of concept, I'll try to continue as TDD.
