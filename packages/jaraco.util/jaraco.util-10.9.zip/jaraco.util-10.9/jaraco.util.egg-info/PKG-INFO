        ===========
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        ``jaraco.util`` contains a number of nominally useful, reusable classes
        and functions. Each is designed to be intuitively named and
        self-documenting (many with extensive doctests), though
        the project is also `documented with runnable tests
        <https://pythonhosted.org/jaraco.util>`_.
        
        Deprecation
        -----------
        
        In general, this grab-bag of routines is deprecated, with much of the
        functionality moved or pending move to another, more appropriate home.
        
        Highlights
        ----------
        
        Some of the more interesting modules include:
        
         - ``.dictlib`` contains RangeMap, a dictionary-like object that maps a
           range of values to a given value.
