jaraco.util
===========

Overview
--------

``jaraco.util`` contains a number of nominally useful, reusable classes
and functions. Each is designed to be intuitively named and
self-documenting (many with extensive doctests), though
the project is also `documented with runnable tests
<https://pythonhosted.org/jaraco.util>`_.

Deprecation
-----------

In general, this grab-bag of routines is deprecated, with much of the
functionality moved or pending move to another, more appropriate home.

Highlights
----------

Some of the more interesting modules include:

 - ``.dictlib`` contains RangeMap, a dictionary-like object that maps a
   range of values to a given value.
