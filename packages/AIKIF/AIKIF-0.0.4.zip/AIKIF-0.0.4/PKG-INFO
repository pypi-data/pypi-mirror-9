Description: #AIKIF
        #####Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Information Framework
        
        ##Overview
        This is an example framework to capture the flow of information initially for personal data management, but ultimately useful for AI applications.<br />
        
        The intent is to allow any type of raw data to be machine understandable using data collectors, ontologies, business mapping rules and embedded tags in programs.
        
        ###Progress
        Area | status
         --- | --- |
        | Code base version            | Pre-Alpha    |
        | Public package version | 0.0.4        |
        | Date notes updated     | 25/02/2015   |
        
        
        ###Quick Start
        This github repository [https://github.com/acutesoftware/AIKIF](https://github.com/acutesoftware/AIKIF) contains the latest code, but the current public release is available via
        
        `pip install aikif`
        
        There are some basic examples shown in the aikif/examples folder:<br />
        	Project Management<br/>
            Code Management<br/>
            Personal Information Management<br/>
        
        To start the web interface use `aikif/web_app/web_aikif.py` or the batch file `aikif\go_web_aikif`

        ##Data Structures
        Data type | description |
         --- | ---                
        | events     | any time or date based subset of information gets logged here  |
        | facts      | the text of the information |
        | contacts   | person details extracted and linked from text or column in table |
        | locations  | physical location in world, or virtual location on network / computer disk |
         
         
        ##Programs
        ###Main Programs
        |Filename | description |
         --- | ---      
        |go_web_aikif.bat | starts the web server for the AIKIF admin interface|
        |index.py		| creates text indexes of all the files|
        |search.py		| searches, using both indexes and ontologies|
        |mapper.py       | applies business rules to map raw input to aikif data structures|
        |context.py      | determines user context|
        |bias.py         | user defined ranking of raw data by source / type / person / date|
        
        ###Toolbox
        Various modules which contain generic functions
        
        This section is where developers add their own programs to be logged and mapped.
        
        
        ###DataTools
        collection of modules to manage data transformations
        
        ###Standard Library Programs
        AIKIF_utils.py	- standard utils for the filelists<br />
        file_mapping.py	- main routine that decides what the output files will be called<br />
        security.py		- manages security, which will allow users to have private data (not the norm for this)<br />
        
        
        
        ###Agents
        Most processes are run via the `agent.py` class to allow for the logging and management.
        
        These programs are used to load a specific dataset, the code used to parse each file is in a separate load procedure<br />
        processRawData.py			- this calls all data load programs and logs results<br />
        create_word_lists.py		- loads a list of nouns, verbs, adjectives from web into local structures<br />
        loadCountry_Gdeltproject.py	- loads a country reference file<br />
        loadPIM_Filelist.py			- loads a list of local files into objects, events, photos<br />
        loadPIM_shopping.py			- sample to show how a personal shopping list is loaded<br />
