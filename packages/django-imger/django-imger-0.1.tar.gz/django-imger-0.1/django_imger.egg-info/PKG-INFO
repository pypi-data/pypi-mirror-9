        =====
        
        Imger is a client side resizing and placement tool for images.
        Images are stored in the settings.MEDIA_ROOT so settings.py needs to include:
        MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL to settings.py. something like::
        
        	MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
        	MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
        
        2. Make sure imger static files are in your static directory::
        
        	/static/imger
        
        3. Add "imger" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'imger',
            )
        
        4. Import ImgerField into your model and create an ImgerField a model class::
        
            from imger.fields import ImgerField
        
        	...
        	image_path = ImgerField(upload_to='testing', width=400, height=300, mime='image/jpg', quality=80)
        
        	All parameters are optional and default as follows:
        
        	upload_to: settings.MEDIA_ROOT
        	width: 300
        	height: 200
        	mime: image/jpg
        	quality: 100
        
        5. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           Navigate to your model with the imger field and upolad an image
           (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
