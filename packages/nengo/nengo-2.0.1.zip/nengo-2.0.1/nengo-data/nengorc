### NENGORC FORMAT

# Nengo RC settings will be read from the following files.
# Files listed first have higher precendence.
#
# 1. nengorc in the current directory.
#    This is useful for settings specific to a single project.
# 2. A operating system specific file in the user's home directory.
#    This is useful for settings you want to apply to all Nengo projects.
#    - Windows: %userprofile%\nengo\nengorc
#    - Other (OS X, Linux): ~/.config/nengo/nengorc
# 3. INSTALL/nengo-data/nengorc (where INSTALL is the installation directory
#    of the Nengo package; this is usually something like
#    /usr/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages or C:\PythonXX\Lib\site-packages).
#
# This example file lists the settings supported by core Nengo with
# a description, the accepted data type and an example line setting the option
# to its default value (commented out).
#
# The RC file is divided into sections by lines containing the section name
# in square brackets. Blanks lines, or lines starting with # or, are ignored,
# as are trailing comments. A setting is set by giving the name followed by
# a : or = and the value.
#
# [example_section]
# setting: value  # optional comment
