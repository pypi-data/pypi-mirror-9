Read Naming Format
==================

Read Naming Format (RNF) is a standard for naming simulated reads.
It is designed to be robust, easy to adopt by existing tools, extendable,
and it provides human-readable read names.

The RNF specification is available on http://github.com/karel-brinda/rnf-spec/.
