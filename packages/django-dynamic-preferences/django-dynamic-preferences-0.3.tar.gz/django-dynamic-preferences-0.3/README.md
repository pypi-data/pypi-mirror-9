# What is dynamic-preferences ?

Dynamic-preferences is a Django app designed to manage your project settings. While most of the time,
a `settings.py` file is sufficient, there are some situations where you need something more flexible,
such as per-user settings and per-site settings.

For per-user settings, you could actually store them in `UserProfile`. However, it means that every time you want to add a new setting, you need to add a new column to the `UserProfile` DB table. Not very efficient.

Dynamic-preferences allow you to register settings (a.k.a. preferences) in a declarative way, for users,
sites and your whole project. Preferences values are serialized before storage in database,
and automatically deserialized when you want to access them.

With dynamic-preferences, you can update settings on the fly, through django's admin or custom forms, without restarting your application.
