Description: pycalphad, a library for the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams
        ==========================================================
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/richardotis/pycalphad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/richardotis/pycalphad)
        **Note**: Unsolicited pull requests are _happily_ accepted!
        
        pycalphad is a free and open-source Python library for 
        designing thermodynamic models, calculating phase diagrams and 
        investigating phase equilibria within the CALPHAD method. It 
        provides routines for reading Thermo-Calc TDB files and for
        solving the multi-component, multi-phase Gibbs energy
        minimization problem.
        
        The purpose of this project is to provide any interested people
        the ability to tinker with and improve the nuts and bolts of 
        CALPHAD modeling without having to be a computer scientist or 
        expert programmer.
