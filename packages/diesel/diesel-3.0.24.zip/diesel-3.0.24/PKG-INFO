Description: 
        diesel is a framework for easily writing reliable and scalable network
        applications in Python.  It uses the greenlet library layered atop
        asynchronous socket I/O in Python to achieve benefits of both
        the threaded-style (linear, blocking-ish code flow) and evented-style
        (no locking, low overhead per connection) concurrency paradigms.  It's
        design is heavily inspired by the Erlang/OTP platform.
        
        It contains high-quality buffering, queuing and synchronization primitives,
        procedure supervision and supervision trees, connection pools, seamless
        thread integration, and more.
        
        An HTTP/1.1+WSGI+WebSockets implementation is included, as well as tight
        integration with the Flask web framework.
        
        Other bundled protocols include MongoDB, Riak, and Redis client libraries.
