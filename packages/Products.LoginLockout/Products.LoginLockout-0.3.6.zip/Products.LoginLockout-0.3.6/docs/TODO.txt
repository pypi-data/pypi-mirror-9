Things that could be done on the LoginLockout product:

- Check security; can the tool or the script or the template be misused to gain
  access to the plugin?

- Allow setting the number of allowed attempts from the configlet.

- Allow setting the timeout value on the configlet (is it implemented at all?)
  Note: It's implemented again, but you change value in ZMI.
