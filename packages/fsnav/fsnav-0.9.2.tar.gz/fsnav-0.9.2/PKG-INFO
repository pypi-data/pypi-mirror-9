        File System Navigation shortcuts for the commandline
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        In short, `FS Nav` allows users to navigate to directories by typing in a
        single word and pressing return.
        
        Learning to use the commandline can be daunting but required in order to use
        specific tools.  The goal of `FS Nav` is to make navigating to common locations
        easier and slightly more intuitive both for new users and those that find
        themselves navigating complex file systems.  
        
        When set up `FS Nav` allows the user to navigate to the `desktop` like so:
        
            $ pwd
            /Users/geowurster
            $ desktop
            $ pwd
            /Users/geowurster/Desktop
        
        NOTE: The above functionality does not yet support the `Windows` commandline
        but works with [cygwin](http://cygwin.org).
        
        
        Commandline Utilities
        ---------------------
        
        #### nav ####
        
        The `nav` utility is responsible for driving the file system navigation.  There
        are several sub-commands, the most important of which is `nav get`, which
        prints out an alias's path.
        
            $ nav get home
            /Users/geowurster
        
        In order to see a list of all currently recognized aliases, use `nav aliases`.
            
            $ nav aliases
            {'applications': '/Applications',
            'desk': '/Users/geowurster/Desktop',
            'desktop': '/Users/geowurster/Desktop',
            ...}
            
        User defined aliases can be added with `nav config addalias`.  New aliases can
        be added and default aliases can be re-defined but default aliases can not be
        fully deleted.
            
            $ nav config addalias fsnav=~/github/FS-Nav desk=~/github
            $ nav get fsnav
            /Users/geowurster/github/FS-Nav
            
            # Re-assign a default alias
            $ nav get desk
            /Users/geowurster/github
            
            # Deleting a re-assigned default alias makes it revert to its original value
            $ nav config deletealias desk
            $ nav get desk
            /Users/geowurster/Desktop
        
        See `nav config --help` for additional commands.
        
        
        #### count ####
        
        A bonus utility of sorts - quickly count items on the file system.  Handles
        wildcard expansion and only counts paths that actually exist.
        
            $ cd github/FS-Nav
            $ count *
            9
            $ count * fsnav/*
            19
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Via pip:
        
            $ pip install fsnav
        
        Master branch:
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/geowurster/FS-Nav
            $ cd FS-Nav
            $ python setup.py install
        
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        Once installed, `FS Nav` requires the user to add a startup command to their
        profile.  In order to just try `FS-Hav`, do `eval $(nav startup generate)`.
        
        Mac, Linux, Cygwin, etc.
            
            $ nav startup profile >> ~/.bash_profile
            $ source ~/.bash_profile
        
        Windows commandline "one-word navigation" is not yet supported.
        
        Verify that everything is working properly with:
            
            $ cd ~/
            $ pwd
            /Users/geowurster
            $ desktop
            $ pwd
            /Users/geowurster/Desktop
        
        
        Python API
        ----------
        
        For detailed information about a given object, do `help(<object>)`.
        
        #### Loading aliases ####
        
        Load only the default aliases `FS-Nav` defines on import.
        
            from pprint import pprint
            
            import fsnav
            
            aliases = fsnav.Aliases(fsnav.DEFAULT_ALIASES)
        
        #### Working with the configfile ####
        
        The configfile is `JSON` encoded and currently only contains user-defined
        aliases in a section called `aliases`.  The path to the configfile is stored
        in `fsnav.CONFIGFILE` and the name of the section containing the aliases is
        stored in `fsnav.CONFIGFILE_ALIAS_SECTION`.
            
            {
                'aliases': {
                    'fsnav': '/Users/geowurster/github/FS-Nav/'
                }
            }
        
        Load the aliases in the configfile:
        
            import json
            
            import fsnav
            
            with open(fsnav.CONFIGFILE) as f:
                cfg_aliases = json.load(f)[fsnav.CONFIGFILE_ALIAS_SECTION]
            
            aliases = fsnav.Aliases(cfg_aliases)
        
        #### Loading multiple sets of aliases ####
        
        Note that the `list()` call is required for Python 3.  Note that the aliases
        from the configfile are loaded last in order to overwrite any default aliases
        with the same name.
        
            import fsnav
            
            all_aliases = list(fsnav.DEFAULT_ALIASES.items()) + list(cfg_aliases.items()) 
            aliases = fsnav.Aliases(all_aliases.copy())
        
        #### The `Aliases()` class ####
        
        `Aliases()` subclasses `dict()` but overrides a few methods for `alias` and
        `path` validation.  A handful of `FS Nav` specific methods are also present.
        Generally, an instance of `Aliases()` acts just like an instance of `dict()`.
        
            import fsnav
            
            aliases = fsnav.Aliases()
            new_aliases = {'desk': '~/Desktop', 'home': '~/'}
            
            for a, p in new_aliases.items():
                aliases[a] = p
            assert sorted(new_aliases.keys()) == sorted(aliases.keys())
            
            del aliases['desk']
            assert 'desk' not in aliases
            
            aliases.update({'desk': '~/Desktop')
            assert aliases['desk'] == new_aliases['desk']
        
        For more information see `help(fsnav.Aliases)`
        
        #### Counting items on the file system ####
        
        The `count` utility directly calls this function.
            
            import fsnav
            
            num_files = fsnav.count('/Users/geowurster/github/FS-Nav/*')
