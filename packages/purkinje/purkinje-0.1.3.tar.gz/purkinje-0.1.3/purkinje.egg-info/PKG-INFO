        ========
        
        
        Test runner for py.test test framework with web GUI
        
        `Live Demo <http://vsrv14679.customer.xenway.de:5000/#/dashboard/>`_
        
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        pukinje is a browser application intended to run on a spare monitor. It shows results of automated
        tests in realtime. Currently, the only supported test framework is `py.test <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_.
        
        To use purkinje:
        
        Create a virtual environment for purkinje and activate it::
        
            mkvirtualenv purkinje
            workon purkinje
        
        Install purkinje::
        
            pip install purkinje
        
        Optionally, create a configuration file ``purkinje.yml`` with the
        following contents:
        
            global:
                logLevel: debug
                debugMode: yes
                serverPort: 5000
                serverHost: localhost
        
        Launch it::
        
            purkinje -f purkinje.yml
        
        or, without configuration file::
        
            purkinje
        
        Open it in a browser::
        
            google-chrome http://localhost:5000/
        
        Prepare your Python/py.test project for reporting to purkinje. In your project's virtualenv,
        install the py.test plugin for purkinje::
        
            pip install pytest-purkinje
        
        Run your tests. The results should be visible in the browser::
        
            py.test
        
        Alternatively, you may run ``purkinje_runner`` in your project directory. It will
        automatically detect changes the the sources and execute py.test::
        
            purkinje_runner
        
        
        Known Limitations
        =================
        
        - Security: There is **no access restriction**; for now, use only on the local machine
        
          - Anyone can use the web application
        
          - Anyone can send test results to the purkinje server
        
          By default, the server is running on localhost and not accessible from
          other machines.
        
        - Only a single test suite
        
          If you run multiple purkinje-enabled test suites simultaneously, test results
          will get mixed up. This might change in a future version.

        System Requirements
        ===================
        
        - Currently, only Python 2.7.x is supported because of gevent. In the future, if gevent should support Python 3, purkinje should also support it. Alternatively, gevent
          might get replaced e.g. by `guv <https://github.com/veegee/guv>`_.
        - tested on Ubuntu 14.04
        - needs a modern browser that supports WebSockets
        
        
        Supported Python versions
        =========================
        
        - Currently, only 2.7.x is supported. Python 3 support is blocked by the following packages:
        
          cssmin
          gevent (which is blocking gevent-websocket)
          inotifyx (which is blocking gevent_inotifyx)
        
        
        Supported Operating Systems
        ===========================
        
        - The server part has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 64 bit
        - The web application should work on any operating system using a modern browser
          (tested with Chrome 40 and Firefox 35)
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        - uses `semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_
        - uses `git-flow git workflow <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_
        - `GitHub page <https://github.com/bbiskup/purkinje/>`_
