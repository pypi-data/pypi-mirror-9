        ``kids.cmd`` is a Python library providing helpers when writing command
        line utilities in python.
        
        It's part of 'Kids' (for Keep It Dead Simple) library.
        
        
        Maturity
        ========
        
        This code is in alpha stage. It wasn't tested on Windows. API may change.
        This is more a draft for an ongoing reflection.
        
        And I should add this is probably not ready to show. Although, a lot of these
        function are used everyday in my projects and I got sick rewritting them for
        every project.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        using ``kids.cmd``:
        
        - Leverage `docopt`_ library to let you write once your help and usage
          doc, and the parsing will be done automatically from this same
          description.
        - Uses kids.ansi to provide nice colored output.
        - Nice user input, one key press or more, with built-in menus.
        
        These assumptions are in the code:
        
        - You don't wan't to mess with parsing the command line and will use
          standard command line compatible with docopt command line.
        - You like having a very simple paradigm with default behavior that
          you can learn after.

        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Tis code is python2 and python3 ready. It wasn't tested on windows.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You don't need to download the GIT version of the code as ``kids.cmd`` is
        available on the PyPI. So you should be able to run::
        
            pip install kids.cmd
        
        If you have downloaded the GIT sources, then you could add install
        the current version via traditional::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        And if you don't have the GIT sources but would like to get the latest
        master or branch from github, you could also::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/0k/kids.cmd
        
        Or even select a specific revision (branch/tag/commit)::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/0k/kids.cmd@master

        Push Request Guidelines
        -----------------------
        
        You can send any code. I'll look at it and will integrate it myself in
        the code base and leave you as the author. This process can take time and
        it'll take less time if you follow the following guidelines:
        
        - check your code with PEP8 or pylint. Try to stick to 80 columns wide.
        - separate your commits per smallest concern.
        - each commit should pass the tests (to allow easy bisect)
        - each functionality/bugfix commit should contain the code, tests,
          and doc.
        - prior minor commit with typographic or code cosmetic changes are
          very welcome. These should be tagged in their commit summary with
          ``!minor``.
        - the commit message should follow gitchangelog rules (check the git
          log to get examples)
        - if the commit fixes an issue or finished the implementation of a
          feature, please mention it in the summary.
        
        If you have some questions about guidelines which is not answered here,
        please check the current ``git log``, you might find previous commit that
        would show you how to deal with your issue.
