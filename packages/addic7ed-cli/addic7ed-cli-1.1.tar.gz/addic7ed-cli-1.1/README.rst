Configuration file
==================

You can store frequently used options in a configuration file. Create a
file at :code:`~/.config/addic7ed` (Linux, OSX) or :code:`%APPDATA%/config` (Windows),
and it will be parsed using the Python ConfigParser (see example below).
It can contain three sections:

* [flags], to set a flag (verbose, hearing-impaired, overwrite, ignore,
  batch or brute-batch)

* [languages], to list prefered languages

* [session], the session to use for authentification

Example::

    [flags]
    hearing-impaired = no
    batch

    [languages]
    french
    english

    [session]
    abcdef

Video organizer
===============

video-organizer_ format is supported. If a "filelist" file is next to an
episode, it will use it to extract its real name and forge the good
query.
