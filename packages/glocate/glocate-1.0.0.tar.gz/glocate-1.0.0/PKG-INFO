Description: This program accepts any text and searchs inside every IP address. With
        each of those IP addresses, geolocate queries Maxmind GeoIP database (http://www.maxmind.com)_
        to look for the city and country where IP address or URL is located.
        
        Geolocate is designed to be used in console with pipes and redirections along
        with applications like traceroute, etc. Geolocate's output is the same text
        than input but IP addresses are going to have appended its country and city and long-lat
        coordinates (depending on verbosity level).
