    """
    Reverse HTTP proxy implementation based on the more generalized
    infra-structure of proxy server.

    Supports multiple scheduling strategies, being the "smart" one
    the most efficient for most of the possible scenarios.

    Conditional re-usage of connections based on boolean flag is possible,
    but care should be taken when using re-usage so that no multiple
    rules are applied for the same connection (eg: https://host.com/hive,
    https://host.com/colony as different rules), this would pose serious
    problems if the back-end servers are different for each rule or if
    the way the final back-end url is created is different for each rule.
