        =====
        
        `SPRING <http://www.sachse.embl.de/emspring/>`_ (**S** \ingle **P** \article **R** \econstruction from **I** \mages \
        of k\ **N** \own **G** \eometry) is a single-particle based helical reconstruction package for electron \
        cryo-micrographs and has been used to determine 3D structures of a variety of highly ordered and less ordered \
        specimens. Spring provides the entire single-particle based work-flow required for helical reconstruction including:
        
        * Classification
        
        * Helical symmetry determination and refinement tools
        
        * High-resolution structure refinement 
        
        * Multi-symmetry structure refinement
        
        Spring is currently developed in the `Sachse <http://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/sachse/index.html>`_ lab at 
        `EMBL <http://www.embl.de>`_ for the Unix operating systems of MacOSX and Linux.

        Spring is released under the modified BSD lisence and integrates several different electron-microscopy specific and \
        other open-source packages. Spring is entirely written in `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ and is based on the EM \
        functions and libraries of:
        
        #. `EMAN2 <http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2>`_

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.83.1447 (2015-1-26)
        ---------------------
        * Fixes in SEGMENTREFINE3D procedure, now also works for non-zero out-of-plane tilts.
        
        0.83.1432 (2014-12-30)
        ----------------------
        
        * Fixes and improvements
        
        1. Installation procedures
                                  
        * Updated dependencies GCC, Numpy, Scipy, Openmpi including build procedures.
        
        2. SEGMENTREFINE3D
                          
        * Computation of persistence length at the end of each refinement run. Can be used now as a selection criterion for discarding less straight helices in the next refinement run.
        * Selection criteria: Straight helices, Layer-line correlation and Projection matching cross-correlation are now selected in percent range of the distribution instead of cutoff values, e.g. upper 20 % --> 80 - 100 %.
        * 'Continue refinement option' - in case no reference structure is given a 3D reconstruction based on the provided parameters is now created for further refinement.
        * Improved segment-based motion correction, now accepts mrcs-stacks.
        * Computation of structure-masked FSC with mask deconvolution according to Ultramicroscopy Chen et al. 2013 (Scheres and Henderson) for resolutions better than 12 Angstrom.
        * Added error estimates for forward x-shift, forward out-of-plane tilt and in-plane rotation angles according to Sachse et al, 2007 J Mol Biol.
        * Overhaul in symmetrization of volumes to make them perfectly even.
        * Diagnostic power spectra are now always written out as EMAN2 image files in addition to diagnostic summary.
        
        3. High-performance computing cluster 
        
        * Added support for SLURM. 
        
        4. SEGMENTCLASS, SEGLAYERLATTICE
                                        
        * Many minor fixes.
        
        Note: old refinement.dbs and grid.dbs need to be upgraded to be readable by the latest Spring version.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           % spring -udb='grid.db' -inp grid.db -out grid_upd.db
           % spring -udb=refinement.db -inp=refinement024.db -out=refinement024_up.db
        
        
        
        0.82.1339 (2014-09-15)
        ----------------------
        
        * Improved installation procedures including build and binary install scripts.
        
        
        
        0.82.1339 (2014-04-25)
        ----------------------
        
        * General fixes, optimizations and enhancements
        
        1. SEGMENTREFINE3D
                          
        
        * Fixes for data sets with large number of asymmetric units
        * Fix/workaround for occasional database lock problems on cluster mounted nodes
        * Fix in 'Absolute limit of x and y-shifts' handling. Now properly respects this.
        * Declared some options as experimental: support remains limited.
        * Occasional over-estimation of FSC fixed due to densities at upper and lower ends of filament
        * Implementation of 'independent half-set' refinement (a.k.a. gold-standard refinement)
        
        Note: the update will break reading your previous refinement.db files
        Database files can be updated as follows:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           % spring -udb=refinement.db -inp=refinement024.db -out=refinement024_up.db
        
        2. SEGREFINE3DINSPECT
                             
        * Additional option of signal-to-noise weighting using FSC file.
        
        3. SEGLAYER2LATTICE
                           
        * Simulation of layer-line pattern takes rotational symmetry into account
        
        
        
        0.81.1282 (2014-01-26)
        ----------------------
        
        * Fixes, enhancements and optimization
        
        1.  SEGMENTREFINE3D
                           
        
        * Disk requirements for temporary directories revised.
        * Improved handling of selected segments. Spring processes helices as one entity and discards them later for 3D reconstruction.
        * FSC only computed with cylinder mask.
        * Improved experimental power spectra for high/maximum resolution analysis.
        
        2. SEGMENT
                  
        * Fix in frame processing.
        * Rotated stack only written if requested.
        
        3. SEGMENTEXAM
                      
        * Addition of selection options from spring.db.
        
        4. SEGCLASSEXAM
                       
        * Addition of mpi option.
        
        5. SEGLAYER2LATTICE
                           
        * Addition of tooltips of predicted Bessel orders.
        
        6. SEGCLASSLAYER
                        
        * Accepts also power spectra as input.
        * Added tooltips on Bessel look up table.
        
        7. General
                  
        * Parameter input from prompt now works using Tab auto completion including file search.
