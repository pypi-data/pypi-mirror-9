This is a python package for using the DHL webservice.
It allows developers to easily connect to DHL services and make requests.
The package creates SOAP requests using the suds-jurko package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/suds-jurko/0.6)
to create shipments, to schedule a pickup and possibly to delete a created shipment.
It also provides the ability to save the shipping labels.
