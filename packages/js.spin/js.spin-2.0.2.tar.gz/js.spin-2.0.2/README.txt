js.spin
=======

Introduction
------------

This library packages `spin.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`spin.js`: http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.spin``) are published to some URL.
