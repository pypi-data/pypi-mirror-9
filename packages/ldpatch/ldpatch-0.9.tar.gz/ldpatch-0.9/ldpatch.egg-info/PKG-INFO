Description: ===========
         LD-PATCH
        ===========
        
        This project aims at implementing patch format for Linked Data,
        as specified at http://www.w3.org/TR/ldpatch .
        
        It was first inspired by the RDF-Patch_ proposal,
        but it aims at being able to cope with most RDF graph
        without relying on bnode identifiers.
