INSTALLATION
============

For Unix like systems it is possible to install from source. For Windows this is
overly complicated, and you are recommended to use the binary installation files.
There are two things that are needed by this package: the igraph c core library
and the python-igraph python package. For both, please see http://igraph.org.

There are basically two installation modes, similar to the python-igraph package
itself (from which most of the setup.py comes).

1) No C core library is installed yet. The packages will be compiled and linked
   statically to an automatically downloaded version of the C core library of
   igraph.
2) A C core library is already installed. In this case, the package will link
   dynamically to the already installed version. This is probably also the
   version that is used by the igraph package, but you may want to double check
   this.

In short: sudo pip install louvain

In case the python-igraph package is already installed before, make sure that
both use the **same versions**.

The cleanest setup it to install and compile the C core library yourself (make
sure that the header files are also included, e.g. install also the development
package from igraph). Then both the python-igraph package, as well as this
package are compiled and (dynamically) linked to the same C core library.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

In case of any problems, best to start over with a clean environment. Make sure
you remove the python-igraph package completely, remove the C core library and
remove the louvain package. Then, do a complete reinstall starting from ``pip
install louvain``. In case you want a dynamic library be sure to then install
the C core library from source before. Make sure you **install the same
versions**.
