This package implements the louvain algorithm in C++ and exposes it to
python. It relies on (python-)igraph for it to function. Besides the relative
flexibility of the implementation, it also scales well, and can be run on graphs
of millions of nodes (as long as they can fit in memory). The core function is
``find_partition`` which finds the optimal partition using the louvain algorithm for
a number of different methods. The methods currently implemented are:

Modularity
  This method compares the actual graph to the expected graph, taking into
  account the degree of the nodes [1]. The expected graph is based on a
  configuration null-model.

RBConfiguration
  This is an extension of modularity which includes a resolution parameter [2].
  In general, a higher resolution parameter will lead to smaller communities.

RBER
  A variant of the previous method that instead of a configuration null-model
  uses a Erdös-Rényi null-model in which each edge has the same probability of
  appearing [2].

CPM
  This method compares to a fixed resolution parameter, so that it finds
  communities that have an internal density higher than the resolution
  parameter, and is separated from other communities with a density lowerer than
  the resolution parameter [3].

Significance
  This is a probabilistic method based on the idea of assessing the probability
  of finding such dense subgraphs in an (ER) random graph [4].

Surprise
  Another probabilistic method, but rather than the probability of finding dense
  subgraphs, it focuses on the probability of so many edges within communities
  [5, 6].
