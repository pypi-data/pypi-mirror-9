EDXML SDK
=========

EDXML_ is a versatile, simple and semantic data representation that facilitates
complex data integration projects.

This repository contains the **EDXML Software Development Kit (SDK)**. The
SDK features the edxml Python_ package as well as a number of example Python
applications, which demonstrate inspecting and validating EDXML data.

For developing EDXML processing scripts based on the Python classes offered by
the edxml package, all you need to do is install the edxml package into the
Python library path of your development system. Symlinking the edxml subdirectory
to the location of your Python script will also work. Or just use 
`Pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/edxml/>`_.
