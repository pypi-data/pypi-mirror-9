        Parameters
        ----------
        phase : OpenPNM Phase object
            The phase to be injected into the Network.  The Phase must have the

        throat_prop : string
            The name of the throat property containing the capillary entry
            pressure.  The default is 'throat.capillary_pressure'.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pores and throats : array_like

            on the inlet locations.  All inlets are invaded at step 0.  It is
