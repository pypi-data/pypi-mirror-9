def perlin_noise(geometry,freq=1,octaves=4,mode='classic',**kwargs):
    r'''
    Generate pore seed values using the Perlin noise algorithm.  This approach
    imparts some spatial clumpiness to the pore seeds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq, octaves : int
        Parameters that control the qualities of the noise.  Lower frequency
        results in more smaller clumps.  Higher octaves gives a more textured
        noise.
    mode : {'classic','simplex'}
        The algorithm to use when generating the noise.

        * 'classic' : (default) The original algorithm developed by Perlin
        * 'simplex' : A newer algorithm that is supposedly faster and results
        in a more natural texture.

    Returns
    -------
    A list of pore seeds values between 0:1 that are spatially correlated (i.e.
    similar values are clumped together)

    Notes
    -----
    - This method uses image analysis type tools, so only works on Cubic
    networks
    - This method requires the 'noise' module is installed

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import OpenPNM
    >>> pn = OpenPNM.Network.Cubic(shape=[50,50,50])
    >>> geom = OpenPNM.Geometry.GenericGeometry(network=pn,pores=pn.Ps,throats=pn.Ts)
    >>> geom.add_model(propname='pore.seed',model=OpenPNM.Geometry.models.pore_seed.perlin_noise)
    >>> im = pn.asarray(geom['pore.seed'])

    Visualizing the end result can be done with:

    ``matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(im[:,25,:],interpolation='none')``

def distance_from_inclusion(geometry,p,**kwargs):
    r'''
    Genrate spatially correlated pore seeds by calculating distance from random
    locations (inclusions) in the domain

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : float
        The fraction of pores in the domain that are set as 'seeds' for the
        distance calculation

    Returns
    -------
    A list of distance values (in voxels) between each pore and it nearest
    seed pore.  A list of voxel distances is returned rather than normalized
    seeds between 0:1 so that the user can manipulate the map as desired, by
    applying desired thresholds and/or scaling to get 0:1 seeds.

    Notes
    -----
    - This method uses image analysis tools, so only works on Cubic networks
    - At present the result contains edge artifacts since no inclusions are present beyond the image boundary

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import OpenPNM
    >>> pn = OpenPNM.Network.Cubic(shape=[50,50,50])
    >>> geom = OpenPNM.Geometry.GenericGeometry(network=pn,pores=pn.Ps,throats=pn.Ts)

def spatially_correlated(geometry,network,weights=None,strel=None,**kwargs):
    r'''
    Generates pore seeds that are spatailly correlated with their neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights : list of ints, optional
        The [Nx,Ny,Nz] distances (in number of pores) in each direction that
        should be correlated.

    strel : array_like, optional (in place of weights)
        The option allows full control over the spatial correlation pattern by
        specifying the structuring element to be used in the convolution.

        The array should be a 3D array containing the strength of correlations
        in each direction.  Nonzero values indicate the strength, direction
        and extent of correlations.  The following would achieve a basic
        correlation in the z-direction:

        strel = sp.array([[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],\
                            [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]],\
                            [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]])

    Notes
    -----
    This approach uses image convolution to replace each pore seed in the
    geoemtry with a weighted average of those around it.  It then converts the
    new seeds back to a random distribution by assuming they new seeds are
    normally distributed.

    Because is uses image analysis tools, it only works on Cubic networks.

    This is the appproached used by Gostick et al [2]_ to create an anistropic
    gas diffusion layer for fuel cell electrodes.
