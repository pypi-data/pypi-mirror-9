                and the fall back both fail to produce a binary distribution

        This method uses the following command to build binary distributions:

        .. code-block:: sh

           $ python setup.py bdist_dumb --format=tar

        This command can fail for two main reasons:

        1. The package is missing binary dependencies.
        2. The ``setup.py`` script doesn't (properly) implement ``bdist_dumb``
           binary distribution format support.

        The first case is dealt with in :py:func:`get_binary_dist()`. To deal
        with the second case this method falls back to the following command:

        .. code-block:: sh

           $ python setup.py bdist

        This fall back is almost never needed, but there are Python packages
        out there which require this fall back (this method was added because
        the installation of ``Paver==1.2.3`` failed, see `issue 37`_ for
