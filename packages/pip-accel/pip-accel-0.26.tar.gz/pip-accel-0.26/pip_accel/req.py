:py:mod:`pip_accel.req` - Requirement objects
=============================================

After downloading the specified requirement(s) pip reports a "requirement set"
to pip-accel. In the past pip-accel would summarize this requirement set into a
list of tuples, where each tuple would contain a requirement's project name,
version and source directory (basically only the information required by
pip-accel remained).

Recently I've started using pip-accel as a library in another project I'm
working on (not yet public) and in that project I am very interested in whether
a given requirement is a direct or transitive requirement. Unfortunately
pip-accel did not preserve this information.

That's when I decided that next to pip's :py:class:`pip.req.InstallRequirement`
and setuptools' :py:class:`pkg_resources.Requirement` I would introduce yet
another type of requirement object... It's basically just a summary of the
other two types of requirement objects and it also provides access to the
original requirement objects (for those who are interested; the interfaces are
basically undocumented AFAIK).
