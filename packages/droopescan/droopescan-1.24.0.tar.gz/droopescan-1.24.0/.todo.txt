Version 1.x:

    - More DOCS. 
    - Make plugins.txt and stuff static.
    - Handle 301 sites such as http://u.acquia.com/sites/?
        Done. Add precision for sites which do have reliable 301. There are two
        types of 301 that I can think of:
            - 301 on folders only. /sites/ -> 301 /fake/ -> 404
            - 301 on everything that looks like a folder. /sites/ -> 301 /fake/ -> 301
            This is very common on Drupal installations because of some redirect
            plugin.
    - Ensure droopescan runs in kali.
        - Add better error for old requests library?
        - Increase --timeout-host
    - install.php
