    - timepickerfield
    - minify
    - dms

# others get extracted according to configuration in composer.json (in particular extra.installer-name) :@

others like this:
    silverstripe/event-calendar -> event_calendar

    https://packagist.org/p/silverstripe/translatable.json

    from there, you can get the installer_name


Further; even though it seems that the SS addon store has two categories, it
has a third one (uncategorized)

    Themes: 26
    Modules: 447
    Without filtering by type: 778

    Total uncategorized: 305

Process for getting all modules is, then
    - Get all, 
    - Get themes,
    - get modules by grep -v -x -f wordlists/composer_themes wordlists/composer_all
    - convert modules using convert-to-folder.py.
