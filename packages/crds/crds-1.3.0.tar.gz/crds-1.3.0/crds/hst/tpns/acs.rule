# DON'T FORGET THAT the "expload tags" (e.g. ABCDALL) MUST NOT APPEAR
#   in the LD file TPN for the affected reference file type FOR ANY 
#   FILE SELECTION FIELDS.  It is this
#   omission that will allow certify to detect an "expload tag", and
#   to indicate to the operator that action is needed (i.e. expload should
#   be run).  These expload tag values are ALLOWED for ROW SELECTION FIELDS.
#
# ALSO if you ADD A NEW EXPLOAD TAG, you must also put it into the 
# cdbs/inc/config.h file so that certify and mkload can be built to know 
# about it.
#
# AND to use a keyword value in an expansion rule, the keyword MUST
# be either a "file select" or "row select" keyword in cdbs_mode for this
# reference file type.  If not, the expansion rule won't have access to
# the keyword value when evaluating the rule, and the rule will not trigger.
#
# History:
# 03/08/12  MSwam   added CCDGAIN=-999 rule to allow pre-SM4 expansion of
#                   gain values for WFC
# 09/06/12  72157   MSwam  added APERTURE expansions  
# 02/20/14  77246   MSwam  add APERTURE=NONE to ANY_FULL expansion
