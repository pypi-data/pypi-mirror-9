        CRDS is a package used for working with astronomical reference files for the
        HST and JWST telescopes.  CRDS is useful for performing various operations on
        reference files or reference file assignment rules.  CRDS is used to assign,
        check, and compare reference files and rules, and also to predict those
        datasets which should potentially be reprocessed due to changes in reference
        files or assignment rules.  CRDS has versioned rules which define the
        assignment of references for each type and instrument configuration.  CRDS has
        web sites corresponding to each project (http://hst-crds.stsci.edu or
        https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/) which record information about reference files
        and provide related services.
