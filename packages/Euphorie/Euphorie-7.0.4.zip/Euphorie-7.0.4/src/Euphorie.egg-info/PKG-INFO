        Introduction
        ============
        
        The Euphorie risk assessment tool is based on hierarchical questionnaires. A
        questionnaire (or survey) covers all possible risks for a specific sector of
        industry.
        
        Each sector organisation can have one or more surveys published simultaneously.
        In order to facilitate development and testing of surveys the system supports
        multiple versions for a survey. Only a single version of a survey can be public
        at any point in time.
