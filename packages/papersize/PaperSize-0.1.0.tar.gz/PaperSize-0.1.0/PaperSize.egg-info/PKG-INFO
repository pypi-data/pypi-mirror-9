Description: Paper size related tools
        
        This module provides tools to manipulate paper sizes, that is:
        
        - a dictionary of several named standard names (e.g. A4, letter) , with their
          respective sizes (with and height);
        - functions to convert sizes between units;
        - functions to manipulate paper orientation (portrait or landscape);
        - tools to parse paper sizes, so that you do not have to worry about the format
          of paper sizes provided by your user, it being `a4` or `21cm x 29.7cm`.
