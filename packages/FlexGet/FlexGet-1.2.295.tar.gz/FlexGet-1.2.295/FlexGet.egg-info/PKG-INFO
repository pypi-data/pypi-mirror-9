        How to use GIT checkout
        -----------------------
        
        Check that you have Python 2.6 - 2.7 available with command ``python -V``.
        
        In some environments newer (or older, if your distro is on python 3,) python
        might be available under another name like 'python26' or 'python2.7' in which
        case you need to use that one instead of plain 'python'.
        
        To start using FlexGet from this directory:
        
        Prerequisites for bootstrap.py:
         - Either put the wheels for `setuptools`_ and `pip`_ in the directory bootstrap.py resides.
         - Or install (a recent version of) the `virtualenv`_ package to your system.
        
        .. _setuptools: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
        .. _pip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        .. _virtualenv: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
        
        After the prerequisites for bootstrap.py are finished, run the following commands::
        
            python bootstrap.py
        
        This will initialize python virtualenv and install all required dependencies
        in it.
        
        If you need deluge or transmission libraries from system wide python use::
        
            python bootstrap.py --system-site-packages
        
        After that FlexGet is usable via ``<checkout directory>/bin/flexget``. Verify
        installation by running::
        
            bin/flexget -V
        
        You may also place the configuration files in ``~/.flexget`` (Unix, Mac OS X)
        or ``C:\Documents and Setting\<username>\flexget`` (Windows).
        
        If you don't want to use virtualenv there's ``flexget_vanilla.py`` file which
        can be used to run FlexGet without bootstrapping, note that you will need to
        install all required dependencies yourself.
        
        Custom Virtualenv
        -----------------
        
        If you want to hack on flexget, but don't want to use paver bootstrap because
        you want to keep your virtualenv outside the repo. You can setup your own virtualenv
        and easily install flexget with in that virtualenv.
        
            # Create virtualenv and source active it.
            pip install paver
        
            pip install -e . # with in the repo.
        
        This will install all the flexget dependencies. Now ``flexget`` should work just fine.
        
        Happy Hacking.
