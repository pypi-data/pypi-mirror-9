This product, ``eke.study``, provides display and RDF ingest of participating
studies and medical protocols that are being executed, will be executed, or
have been executed by the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN_).  Studies
and protocols are the major research efforts (and therefore funded entities)
that EDRN researchers pursue, and therefore are a vital component of the EDRN
Knowledge Environment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to make it easy to discover,
share, search for, and retrieve all of EDRN's collective knowledge, including
cancers and other diseases, biomarkers, specimens, participants, staff, and-as
in the case of this product-studies and protocols.

Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any
Plone_ compatible site.

This software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,
operated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.

*Note for Developers*: Tests for this package do not work correctly under the
RoadRunner.  Use the standard instance test runner instead.  (It's not the
fault of the RoadRunner; it has to do with co-dependency of this project with
eke.biomarker).
