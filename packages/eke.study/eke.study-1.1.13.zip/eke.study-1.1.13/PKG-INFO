Description: *********
        eke.study
        *********
        
        This product, ``eke.study``, provides display and RDF ingest of participating
        studies and medical protocols that are being executed, will be executed, or
        have been executed by the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN_).  Studies
        and protocols are the major research efforts (and therefore funded entities)
        that EDRN researchers pursue, and therefore are a vital component of the EDRN
        Knowledge Environment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to make it easy to discover,
        share, search for, and retrieve all of EDRN's collective knowledge, including
        cancers and other diseases, biomarkers, specimens, participants, staff, and-as
        in the case of this product-studies and protocols.
        
        Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any
        Plone_ compatible site.
        
        This software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,
        operated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.
        
        *Note for Developers*: Tests for this package do not work correctly under the
        RoadRunner.  Use the standard instance test runner instead.  (It's not the
        fault of the RoadRunner; it has to do with co-dependency of this project with
        eke.biomarker).

        Installation
        ============
        
        Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.
        
        • Add ``eke.study`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
         
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                eke.study
                
        • Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
          
            % ./bin/buildout
                
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.

        1.1.4 — Permanently adds 15 resilience to a shoulder slot item

        -----------------------
         
        This release updates the GenericSetup profile to 4, provides upgrade steps to
        that profile, and makes the testing and development harness depend on "trunk"
        level of other eggs instead of on released versions of those eggs.  Also, it
        removes in incompatible profile dependency.

        This release addresses a number of issues 
        that make this component (and some of its
        selected counterparts) "prime time" for
        the operational NCI portal. 
        
        This release addresses the following issues:

        This release addresses the following issues:
        
        * https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-551 - Add lock icon to biomarkers
          and science data that are "secure" to protocol pages
        * https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-523 - Create search indexes; in
          particular, searches are enabled for abbreviated protocol name, biomarker
          names, PI names, collaborative group text, dataset names (courtesy of
          updates to ``eke.ecas``), and involved investigator sites.
        
        
        0.0.1 — HTML Formatting
        -----------------------
        
        The following issue is the sole issue addressed in this release:
