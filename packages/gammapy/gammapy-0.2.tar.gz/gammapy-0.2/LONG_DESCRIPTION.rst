**Gammapy** is an open source (BSD licensed) gamma-ray astronomy Python package.

It is an in-development `affiliated package <http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`__ of `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__ 
that builds on the core `scientific Python stack <http://www.scipy.org/about.html>`__ to provide tools to simulate and analyse
the gamma-ray sky for telescopes such as `Fermi <http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`__, `H.E.S.S. <http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/>`__
and `CTA <https://www.cta-observatory.org/>`__.

Currently the functionality is limited and geared towards Galactic plane survey studies,
but the idea is that Gammapy is a place to share and collaborate for gamma-ray astronomy Pythonistas
