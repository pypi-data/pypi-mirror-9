Introduction
============

Currently the `gammapy.scripts` sub-package contains the Gammapy command line tools.

This might change though ... see the notes here:
https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pull/230

To be able to use them you have to install Gammapy:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install --user .


For Gammapy development we recommend you run this command so that you can edit
Gammapy and the tools and don't have to re-install after every change.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install --user --editable .
