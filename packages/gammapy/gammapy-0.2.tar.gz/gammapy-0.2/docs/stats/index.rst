Introduction
============

`gammapy.stats` holds statistical estimators,
fit statistics and algorithms commonly used in gamma-ray astronomy.

It is mostly concerned with the evaluation of one or several observations
that count events in a given region and time window, i.e. with
Poisson-distributed counts measurements.

For on-off methods we will use the following variable names
following the notation in [Cousins2007]_:

================= ====================================================
Variable          Definition
================= ====================================================
``n_on``          Total observed counts in the on region
``n_off``         Total observed counts in the off region
``mu_on``         Total expected counts in the on region
``mu_off``        Total expected counts in the off region
``mu_signal``     Signal expected counts in the on region
``mu_background`` Background expected counts in the on region
``a_on``          Relative background efficiency in the on region
``a_off``         Relative background efficiency in the off region
``alpha``         Background efficiency ratio ``a_on`` / ``a_off``
================= ====================================================

The following formulae show how an on-off measurement :math:`(n_{on}, n_{off})`
is related to the quantities in the above table:

.. math::

    n_{on} \sim Pois(\mu_{on})\text{ with }\mu_{on} = \mu_s + \mu_b

    n_{off} \sim Pois(\mu_{off})\text{ with }\mu_{off} = \mu_b / \alpha\text{ with }\alpha = a_{on} / a_{off}

The maximum likelihood estimate of a signal excess is

.. math::
   n_{excess} = n_{on} - \alpha\ n_{off}.

When the background is known and there is only an "on" region (sometimes also called "source region"),
we use the variable names ``n_observed``, ``mu_observed``, ``mu_signal`` and ``mu_background``.

================= ====================================================
Variable          Definition
================= ====================================================
``n_observed``    Observed counts
``mu_observed``   Expected counts (signal + background)
================= ====================================================

Here's some references describing the available methods:
[LiMa1983]_, [Cash1979]_, [Stewart2009]_, [Rolke2005]_, [Feldman1998]_, [Cousins2007]_.

Getting Started
===============

As an example, assume you have measured :math:`n_{on} = 18` counts in a
region where you suspect a source might be present and :math:`n_{off} = 97`
counts in a background control region where you assume no source is present
and that is :math:`a_{off}/a_{on}=10` times larger than the on-region.

Here's how you compute the statistical significance of your detection 
with the Li \& Ma formula:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from gammapy.stats import significance_on_off
   >>> significance_on_off(n_on=18, n_off=97, alpha=1. / 10, method='lima')
