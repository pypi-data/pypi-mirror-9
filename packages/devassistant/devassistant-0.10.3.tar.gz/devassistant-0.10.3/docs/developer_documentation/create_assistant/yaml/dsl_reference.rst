Yaml DSL Reference
==================

*Note: The Yaml DSL has changed significantly in 0.9.0 in backwards incompatible manner.
This documentation is only for version 0.9.0 and later.*

This is a reference manual to writing yaml assistants. Yaml assistants
use a special DSL defined on this page. For real examples, have a look
at `assistants in our Github repo`_.

*Why the hell another DSL?*
  When we started creating DevAssistant and we were asking people who
  work in various languages whether they'd consider contributing assistants
  for those languages, we hit the "I'm not touching Python" barrier. Since
  we wanted to keep the assistants consistent (centralized logging, sharing
  common functionality, same backtraces, etc...), we created a new DSL. This DSL
  is very well suited for what it's supposed to do, but we understand that some
  people don't want to learn it for various reasons. That is why, in 0.10.0, we
  introduced a concept called :ref:`DevAssistant PingPong <create_pingpong_assistant>`.
  Using PingPong, you can write assistants in scripting languages, while still
  utilizing DevAssistant as a "library of functions".

Assistant Roles
---------------

For list and description of assistant roles see :ref:`assistant_roles_devel`.

The role is implied by assistant location in one of the load path directories,
as mentioned in :ref:`assistants_loading_mechanism`.

All the rules mentioned in this document apply to all types of assistants,
with exception of sections :ref:`tweak_assistants_ref`, :ref:`preparer_assistants_ref` and
:ref:`extras_assistants_ref` that talk about specifics of Tweak, resp. Preparer, resp. Extras
assistants.

Assistant Name
--------------

Assistant name is a short name used on command line, e.g. ``python``. Historically,
it had to be the only top-level yaml mapping in the file, e.g.::

   python:
     fullname: Python
     description: Some verbose description

Since DevAssistant 0.9.0, it is preferred to omit it and just provide the assistant
attributes as the top level mapping::

   fullname: Python
   description: Some verbose description

Assistant name is derived from the filename by stripping the ``.yaml`` extension,
e.g. assistant ``python.yaml`` file is named ``python``.

Assistant Attributes
--------------------

Assistant attributes form the top level mapping in Yaml file::

   fullname: Python

   run:
   - cl: mkdir -p $name
   - log_i: I'm in $name

List of allowed attributes follows (all of them are optional, and have some
sort of reasonable default, it's up to your consideration which of them to use):

``fullname``
  a verbose name that will be displayed to user (``Python Assistant``)
``description``
  a (verbose) description to show to user (``Bla bla create project bla bla``)
``dependencies`` (and ``dependencies_*``)
  specification of dependencies, see below `Dependencies`_
``args``
  specification of arguments, see below `Arguments`_
``files``
  specification of used files, see below `Files`_
``project_type``
  type of the project, see :ref:`project_types_ref`
``run`` (and ``run_*``)
  specification of actual operations, see :ref:`run_sections_ref`
``pre_run`` and ``post_run``
  specification of operations to carry out before/after running main ``run`` section,
  see below `Assistants Invocation`_; follow the rules specified in :ref:`run_sections_ref`
``files_dir``
  directory where to take files (templates, helper scripts, ...) from. Defaults
  to base directory from where this assistant is taken + ``files``. E.g. if
  this assistant is ``~/.devassistant/assistants/crt/path/and/more.yaml``,
  files will be taken from ``~/.devassistant/files/crt/path/and/more`` by default.
``icon_path``
  absolute or relative path to icon of this assistant (will be used by GUI).
  If not present, a default path will be used - this is derived from absolute
  assistant path by replacing ``assistants`` by ``icons`` and ``.yaml`` by
  ``.svg`` - e.g. for ``~/.devassistant/assistants/crt/foo/bar.yaml``,
  the default icon path is ``~/.devassistant/icons/crt/foo/bar.svg``

.. _assistants_invocation_ref:

Assistants Invocation
---------------------

When you invoke DevAssistant with it will run following assistants sections in following order:

- ``pre_run``
- ``dependencies``
- ``run`` (possibly different section for `Tweak Assistants`_)
- ``post_run``

If any of the first three sections fails in any step, DevAssistant will immediately skip to
``post_run`` and the whole invocation will be considered as failed (will return non-zero code
on command line and show "Failed" in GUI).

.. _dependencies_ref:

Dependencies
------------

Yaml assistants can express their dependencies in multiple sections.

- Packages from section ``dependencies`` are **always** installed.
- If there is a section named ``dependencies_foo``, then dependencies from this section are installed
  **iff** ``foo`` argument is used (either via commandline or via gui). For example::

   $ da python --foo

- These rules differ for `Tweak Assistants`_

Each section contains a list of mappings ``dependency type: [list, of, deps]``.
If you provide more mappings like this::

   dependencies:
   - rpm: [foo]
   - rpm: ["@bar"]

they will be traversed and installed one by one. Supported dependency types: 

``rpm``
  the dependency list can contain RPM packages or YUM groups
  (groups must begin with ``@`` and be quoted, e.g. ``"@Group name"``)
``use`` / ``call`` (these two do completely same, ``call`` is obsolete and will be removed in 0.9.0)
  installs dependencies from snippet/another dependency section of this assistant/dependency
  section of superassistant. For example::

   dependencies:
   - use: foo.dependencies
   - use: foo.dependencies_bar # will install dependencies from snippet "foo", section "bar"
   - use: self.dependencies_baz # will install dependencies from section "dependencies_baz" of this assistant
   - use: super.dependencies # will install dependencies from "dependencies" section of first superassistant that has such section

``if``, ``else``
  conditional dependency installation. For more info on conditions see :ref:`run_sections_ref`.
  A very simple example::

   dependencies:
   - if $foo:
     - rpm: [bar]
   - else:
     - rpm: [spam]

Full example::

   dependencies: - rpm: [foo, "@bar"]

   dependencies_spam:
   - rpm: [beans, eggs]
   - if $with_spam:
     - use: spam.spamspam
   - rpm: ["ham${more_ham}"]

Sometimes your dependencies may get terribly complex - they depend on many
parameters, you need to use them dynamically during ``run``, etc. In these
cases, consider using :ref:`dependencies_command_ref` in ``run`` section.

Arguments
---------

Arguments are used for specifying commandline arguments or GUI inputs.
Every assistant can have zero to multiple arguments.

The ``args`` section of each yaml assistant is a mapping of arguments to
their attributes::

   args:
     name:
       flags:
         - -n
         - --name
       help: Name of the project to create.

Alternatively, the arguments can be provided in a list, which is useful when
you want multiple positional arguments, i. e. their order is important to you::

   args:
     - from:
         flags: [from]
         help: Source destination
     - to:
         flags: [to]
         help: Target destination

Available argument attributes:

``flags``
  specifies commandline flags to use for this argument. The longer flag
  (without the ``--``, e.g. ``name`` from ``--name``) will hold the specified
  commandline/gui value during ``run`` section, e.g. will be accessible as ``$name``.
``help``
  a help string
``required``
  one of ``{true,false}`` - is this argument required?
``nargs``
  how many parameters this argument accepts, one of ``{0, ?,*,+}``
  (e.g. {0, 0 or 1, 0 or more, 1 or more})
``default``
  a default value (this will cause the default value to be
  set even if the parameter wasn't used by user)
``action``
  one of ``{store_true, [default_iff_used, value]}`` - the ``store_true`` value
  will create a switch from the argument, so it won't accept any
  parameters; the ``[default_iff_used, value]`` will cause the argument to
  be set to default value ``value`` **iff** it was used without parameters
  (if it wasn't used, it won't be defined at all)
``metavar``
  a name of variable to show in help on command line, e.g. with ``metavar: META``, you'll
  get a help line ``--some-arg META <help>``.
``use``
  name of the snippet to load this argument from; any other specified attributes
  will override those from the snippet By convention, some arguments
  should be common to all or most of the assistants.
  See :ref:`common_assistant_behaviour`
``preserved``
  if set, the value of this argument will be saved and will reappear in the next launch
  of devassistant GUI. The attribute string is a key under which the argument value
  will be stored. The key should be of the form "scope.argname" so that you can 
  either share the value across more assistants or avoid collisions if any other 
  assistant uses an argument with same name but different meaning.
  The argument values are stored in "~/.devassistant/.config".
  It is ignored in command-line interface.

Gui Hints
~~~~~~~~~

GUI needs to work with arguments dynamically, choose proper widgets and offer
sensible default values to user. These are not always automatically
retrieveable from arguments that suffice for commandline. For example, GUI
cannot meaningfully prefill argument that says it "defaults to current working
directory". Also, it cannot tell whether to choose a widget for path (with the
"Browse ..." button) or just a plain text field.

Because of that, each argument can have ``gui_hints`` attribute.
This can specify that this argument is of certain type (path/str/bool) and
has a certain default. If not specified in ``gui_hints``, the default is
taken from the argument itself, if not even there, a sensible "empty" default
value is used (home directory/empty string/false). For example::

   args:
     path:
       flags:
       - [-p, --path]
       gui_hints:
         type: path
         default: $(pwd)/foo

If you want your assistant to work properly with GUI, it is good to use
``gui_hints`` (currently, it only makes sense to use it for ``path``
attributes, as ``str`` and ``bool`` get proper widgets and default values
automatically).

Files
-----

This section serves as a list of aliases of files stored in one of the
``files`` dirs of DevAssistant. E.g. if your assistant is
``assistants/crt/foo/bar.yaml``, then files are taken relative to
``files/crt/foo/bar/`` directory. So if you have a file
``files/crt/foo/bar/spam.foo``, you can use::

   files:
     spam: &spam
       source: spam.foo

This will allow you to reference the ``spam.foo`` file in ``run`` section as
``*spam`` without having to know where exactly it is located in your
installation of DevAssistant. Note, that the Yaml anchor name should be
the same as mapping name, e.g. the two ``spam`` in ``spam: &spam`` should
match. This is because of `issue 74 <https://github.com/devassistant/devassistant/issues/74>`_,
that can't really be reasonably fixed.

Run
---

Reference for run sections has a separate page: :ref:`run_sections_ref`.

.. _creator_assistants_ref:

Creator Assistants
------------------

Creator assistants are assistants that *create* something, be it a source file,
a configuration file template or a whole new project. They must be placed under
``assistants/crt`` subdirectory or one of the load paths, as mentioned in
:ref:`assistants_loading_mechanism`.

They usually create ``.devassistant`` file (see :ref:`dot_devassistant_ref`).

.. _tweak_assistants_ref:

Tweak Assistants
----------------

Tweak assistants are assistants that are supposed to work with
already created project. They must be placed under ``assistants/twk``
subdirectory of one of the load paths, as mentioned in
:ref:`assistants_loading_mechanism`.

There are few special things about tweak assistants:

- They usually utilize ``dda_r`` to read the whole ``.devassistant`` file (usually from directory
  specified by ``path`` variable or from current directory). *Since version 0.8.0, every tweak
  assistant has to do this on its own, be it in pre_run or run section*. This also allows you
  to work non-devassistant projects - just don't use ``dda_r``.

The special rules below *only apply if you use dda_t in pre_run section*.

- They use dependency sections according to the normal rules + they use *all*
  the sections that are named according to ``project_type`` loaded from ``.devassistant``,
  e.g. if ``project_type`` is ``[foo, bar]``, dependency sections
  ``dependencies``, ``dependencies_foo`` and ``dependencies_foo_bar`` will
  be used as well as any sections that would get installed according to
  specified parameters. The rationale behind this is, that if you have e.g.
  ``eclipse`` tweak assistant that should work for both ``python django`` and
  ``python flask`` projects, chance is that they have some common dependencies,
  e.g. ``eclipse-pydev``. So you can just place these common dependencies in
  ``dependencies_python`` and you're done (you can possibly place special
  per-framework dependencies into e.g. ``dependencies_python_django``).
- By default, they don't use ``run`` section. Assuming that ``project_type``
  is ``[foo, bar]``, they first try to find ``run_foo_bar``, then ``run_foo``
  and then just ``run``. The first found is used. If you however use cli/gui
  parameter ``spam`` and section ``run_spam`` is present, then this is run instead.

.. _preparer_assistants_ref:

Preparer Assistants
-------------------

Preparer assistants are assistants that are supposed to checkout sources of upstream
projects and set up environment for them (possibly utilizing their ``.devassistant`` file,
if they have one). Preparers must be placed under ``assistants/prep`` subdirectory of one
of the load paths, as mentioned in :ref:`assistants_loading_mechanism`.

Preparer assistants commonly utilize the ``dda_dependencies`` and ``dda_run``
commands in ``run`` section.

.. _extras_assistants_ref:

Extras Assistants
-----------------

Extras assistants are supposed to carry out arbitrary task that are not related to a specific
project. They must be placed under ``assistants/extra`` subdirectory of one of the load paths,
as mentioned in :ref:`assistants_loading_mechanism`. Otherwise, there is nothing special about
extras assistants in terms of execution by DevAssistant.
