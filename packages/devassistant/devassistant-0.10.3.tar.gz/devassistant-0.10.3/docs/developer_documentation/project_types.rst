Project Types
=============

This is a list of official project types that projects should use in their
``.devassistant`` file and Creator assistants should state. If you choose one
of the official project types, there is a good chance that Tweak and Preparer
assistants written by others will work well with projects created by your Creator.

The project type is given as a list of strings - these describe the project from
the most general type to the most specific. E.g::

   project_type: [python, django]

If you don't use ``project_type`` in your Creator assistant, it will be automatically
generated: If your assistant is ``crt/footest/foobar.yaml``, project
type in ``.devassistant`` will be ``[footest, foobar]``. This means that Tweak and
Preparer assistants written by others may not work well with your project, but otherwise
it does no harm.

**Note: the list is currently not very thorough and it is meant to grow
as we get requested by assistant developers.**
