There are two basic ways to create your own assistants. You can either learn
our Yaml DSL and :ref:`write pure Yaml assistants <create_yaml_assistant>` or you can
use an approach called :ref:`"DevAssistant PingPong" <create_pingpong_assistant>`.
PingPong let's you write assistants in scripting languages, while still utilizing
DevAssistant functionality, so you don't have to learn the DSL (to be precise, you only
need to learn a very small portion of it).
