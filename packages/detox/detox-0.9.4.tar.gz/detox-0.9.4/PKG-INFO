Description: 
        What is detox?
        ==========================
        
        detox is the distributed version of "tox".  It makes efficient use of multiple
        CPUs by running all possible activities in parallel.  It has the same options
        and configuration that tox has so after installation can just run::
        
            detox
        
        in the same way and with the same options with which you would run
        ``tox``, see the `tox home page`_ for more info.
        
        Please file issues as "tox" issues using the "detox" component:

        .. note::
        
            detox runs only on python2.6 and python2.7 (but supports creation of
            python3 and all environments supported of the underlying "tox" command)
