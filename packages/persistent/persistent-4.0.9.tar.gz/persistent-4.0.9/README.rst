``persistent``:  automatic persistence for Python objects
=========================================================

This package contains a generic persistence implementation for Python. It
forms the core protocol for making objects interact "transparently" with
a database such as the ZODB.

Please see the Sphinx documentation (``docs/index.rst``) for further
information.

.. note::

   Use of this standalone ``persistent`` release is not recommended or
   supported with ZODB < 3.11.  ZODB 3.10 and earlier bundle their own
   version of  the ``persistent`` package.
