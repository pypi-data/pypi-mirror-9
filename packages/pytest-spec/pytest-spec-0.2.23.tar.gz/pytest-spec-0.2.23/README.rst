pytest-spec
===========
pytest plugin to display test execution output like a SPECIFICATION.


Available features
==================
* Format output to look like specification.
* Group tests by classes.
* Failed, passed and skipped are marked and colored.
* Remove test\_ and underscores for every test.
* Method under test may be highlighted (method) like in example.

Output example
==============

::

    py.test --spec

    test/test_example.py::TestWhenExamplePassed
        [PASS]  Execute returns positive return code

    test/test_example.py::TestWhenExampleFailed
        [FAIL]  Execute returns negative return code

    test/test_example.py::TestWhenExampleIsSkipped
        [SKIP]  Execute returns something

    test/test_example.py::TestExamplesWhenMethodUnderTestIsHighlighted
        [FAIL]  The (execute_command) returns negative return code
        [PASS]  The (execute_command) returns positive return code
        [SKIP]  The (execute_command) returns something

Highlight method under test
===========================
Simple test definition is required (double '__' characters before and after method)
to put method under test between '<>' characters e.g.
::

    def test__execute_method__returns_something(self):

may be displayed as:
::

    [PASS]  The (execute_command) returns something
    [FAIL]  The (execute_command) returns something
    [SKIP]  The (execute_command) returns something

This type of format provides clear information:

* which method is under test
* what kind of result should be expected
