Introduction
------------

AnuGA is a python package with some C extensions (and an optional fortran 
extension). At present AnuGA has not been transported to python 3. 
We recommend using python 2.7. 

If you have a python 2.7 environment with gcc and gfortran support, 
then you can use easy_install to install the latest release 
version of AnuGA. 


Python Environment
------------------

A safe way to install AnuGA is to use a separate python environment 
to isolate it from the rest of your system. Miniconda provides such 
an environment.
