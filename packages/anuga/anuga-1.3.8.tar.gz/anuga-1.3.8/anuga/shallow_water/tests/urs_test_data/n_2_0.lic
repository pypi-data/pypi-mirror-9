    <source>Generated by Chris Thomas as part of tsunami risk modelling team July 2008
    to develop a series of datasets to test urs2sts functionality. 
    Problem is to use three sources (defined in mux2 files, source 1, 2 and 3) 
    at 5 stations (0,1,2,3,4) and to compare output from urs2sts to these csv files.
    The comparison will be done on an individual source basis and the combined with
    the weighting of 1 for source 1, 2 for source 2 and 3 for source 3.
    This file provides the velocity in northing direction timeseries 
    for source 2 and station 0.</source>
