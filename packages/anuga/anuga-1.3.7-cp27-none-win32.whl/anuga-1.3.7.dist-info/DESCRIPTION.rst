What is AnuGA?
--------------

AnuGA (pronounced "AHnooGAH") is open-source software for the simulation of
the shallow water equation, in particular it can be used to model tsunamis
and floods.

AnuGA is a python package with some C extensions (and an optional 
fortran extension). At present AnuGA has not been ported to python 3. 
We recommend using python 2.7  

Developed at the Risk Assessment Methods Project at Geoscience
Australia and Mathematical Sciences Institute at the Australian
National University.
