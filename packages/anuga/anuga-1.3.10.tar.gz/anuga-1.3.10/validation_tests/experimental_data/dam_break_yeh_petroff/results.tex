\section{The Yeh--Petroff dam break problem}
Yeh and Petroff of the University of Washington conducted experimental dam break with an obstruction column, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:YP}.
The Yeh--Petroff dam break problem was further simulated by Gomez-Gesteira and Dalrymple~\cite{GD2004} and Silvester and Cleary~\cite{SC2006}. A similar problem was studied by Arnason et al.~\cite{APY2009}.
We shall compare our \anuga{} solution to the experimental data of Yeh and Petroff.

\subsection{Results}

We should see broad agreement between the experimental data and the numerical solution. Some disagreement is expected because the flows in this experimental situation show fairly rapid spatial and temporal variations, which are to some extent outside the domain of the shallow water approximation.
