        =======================
        MysqlSimpleQueryBuilder
        =======================
        
        Following the rule *simple easy, complex possible*, the package provides API for simple queries,
        nested transactions and aid for complex query building and profiling. It's a small wrapper
        around a Python MySQL driver.
        
        The package is written on the following assumptions:
        
        #. SQL is feasible and representative DSL
        #. Simple SQL is simple but tedious to write by hand
        #. Complex SQL is possible and should be written by hand or constructed elaborately
        #. Unit/integration testing of domain logic against database is necessary
        #. Database abstraction in the age of SaaS is a waste
