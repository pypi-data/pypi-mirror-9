Contributing to django-internationalflavor
==========================================
Since django-internationalflavor is an open source project, contributions of many forms are welcomed. Examples of
possible contributions include:

* Bug patches
* Data corrections
* New features
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and reviews of pull requests

We use GitHub to keep track of issues and pull requests. You can always
`submit an issue <https://github.com/ralphje/django-internationalflavor/issues>`_ when you encounter something out of
the ordinary.

Development
===========
For some of the management commands below, we use ``invoke``, amongst other tools. To set up your development
environment, you probably want to install the requirements in the ``tests/requirements.txt`` file::

    $ git clone https://github.com/ralphje/django-internationalflavor
    $ virtualenv venvs/django-internationalflavor
    $ . venvs/django-internationalflavor/bin/activate
    $ cd django-internationalflavor
    $ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

The documentation is built using Spinx. Additional requirements to build the documentation can be found in
``docs/requirements.txt``

Tests
=====
We use Tox to test this project in different environments. Running tests is therefore as simple as
`installing Tox <http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`_ and running it in the root checkout directory::

    $ git clone https://github.com/ralphje/django-internationalflavor
    $ cd django-internationalflavor
    $ tox
    [...]
      congratulations :)

If you only want to test in a specific environment, you can do so by using::

    tox -e py34-1.7

You can list all available environments with ``tox -l``.

Common Locale Data Repository
=============================
We use the CLDR for several pieces of international data. The following command can be ran to update the repository
data with the latest CLDR (download the full JSON zip)::

    invoke pull_cldr cldr.zip

This will generate (or update) two types of files: all ``_cldr_data.py`` files, with dicts containing translatable
strings, and ``cldr.po`` files, that contain the translations of all CLDR strings.

Translations
============
If you wish to contribute translations, please do so
`online at Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/django-internationalflavor/>`_.

If some translations from the CLDR are incorrect or incomplete, please contribute these online to
`the CLDR repository <http://cldr.unicode.org/index/survey-tool>`_.

Since we use the CLDR as an additional source of translations, we need to merge different files together. Instead of
running ``django-admin.py makemessages`` and ``django-admin.py compilemessages`` after changing any translation
strings, you should run::

    invoke make_translations

This will automatically find the translation strings (just as ``makemessages`` would), but additionally merges and
compiles the correct files. This should result in the following files in the repository:

* ``django.po`` and ``django.mo``, fully merged and compiled translation file which will be used by Django;
* ``django_only.po``, file solely containing the strings that are not translated by the CLDR - this file is kept in
  sync with Transifex. Newly discovered strings are automatically added in the same way as ``makemessages`` updates the
  ``django.po`` file;
* and ``cldr.po``, which is already created by ``pull_cldr``

Modifications in the ``django.po`` file will be lost when ``make_translations`` is ran: translated strings in
``django_only.po`` and ``cldr.po`` take precedence. Also note that the ``cldr.po`` file is automatically overwritten
when running ``pull_cldr``.

Transifex sync
--------------
This section only applies to those having maintainer access to the Transifex repository.

You can synchronize the translations with Transifex by running::

    invoke pull_translations

After new translations have been added, please run::

    invoke push_translations
