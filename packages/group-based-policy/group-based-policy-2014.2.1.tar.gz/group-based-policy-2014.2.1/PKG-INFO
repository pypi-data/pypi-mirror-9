Description: Group Based Policy (GBP) provides declarative abstractions for achieving
        scalable intent-based infrastructure automation.
        
        GBP complements the OpenStack networking model with the notion of policies
        that can be applied between groups of network endpoints. As users look beyond
        basic connectivity, richer network services with diverse implementations and
        network properties are naturally expressed as policies. Examples include
        service chaining, QoS, path properties, access control, etc.
        
        GBP allows application administrators to express their networking requirements
        using a Group and a Policy Rules-Set abstraction. The specifics of policy
        rendering are left to the underlying pluggable policy driver.
        
        GBP model also supports a redirect operation that makes it easy to abstract
        and consume complex network service chains and graphs.
