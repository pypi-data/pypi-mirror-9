Description: AsyncSSH Overview
        =================
        
        AsyncSSH is a Python package which provides an asynchronous client and
        server implementation of the SSHv2 protocol on top of the Python asyncio
        framework. It requires Python 3.4 or later and either the PyCA library or
        the PyCrypto library for some cryptographic functions.

        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        To use ``asyncssh``, you need the following:
        
        * Python 3.4 or later
        * PyCrypto 2.6 or later and/or PyCA 0.6.1 or later
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        #. Install Python 3.4 or later from http://www.python.org or your
           favorite packaging system.
        
        #. Install PyCrypto 2.6 or later from http://www.pycrypto.org and/or
           PyCA 0.6.1 or later from https://cryptography.io to provide basic
           crypto support.
        
        #. Optionally install libsodium from https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium
           and libnacl from https://github.com/saltstack/libnacl if you want
           support for Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Ed25519 keys,
           and the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher.
        
        #. Optionally install bcrypt from https://code.google.com/p/py-bcrypt
           if you want support for OpenSSH private key encryption.
        
        #. Install AsyncSSH by running::
        
           % pip install asyncssh
