Description: Python utilities for working with active subspaces. 
        
        WARNING: Development is very active right now, so the interfaces are far from
        stable. It should settle down soon. Feel free to follow development.
        
        Right now I'm using Enthought's Python Distribution and Canopy for development.
        You'll need numpy and scipy for these tools. 
        
        You also need a linear program and quadratic program solver. I'm using Gurobi;
        you can see the gurobi_wrapper.py that solves the problems I need. To get
        Gurobi's Python interface working with Enthought/Canopy, take a look at this
