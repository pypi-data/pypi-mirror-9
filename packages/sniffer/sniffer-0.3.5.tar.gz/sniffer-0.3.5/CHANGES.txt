   change in files (tmp files?) causes exceptions to be thrown every now and then.

        See README for usage.

 - Psyco is optional, and will be used if present.

 - Got a macbook pro, so I can test the OSX-specific implementation.
 - In OSX, fixed bug where you cannot keyboard interrupt when using the MacFSEvents library.
