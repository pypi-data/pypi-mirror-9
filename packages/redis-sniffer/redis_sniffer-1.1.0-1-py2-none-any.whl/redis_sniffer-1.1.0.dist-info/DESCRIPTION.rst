# Redis Sniffer v1.1.0

## About

This tool will monitor a specific port and interface for redis traffic and captures the commands being sent to Redis and/or formatted full TCP dump data.  This can be used for analysis for debugging or for replaying the transactions as a way of doing real load/performance testing.

Redis Hound must be run locally on a Redis server or a server that is sending commands to Redis.
