Description: # Redis Sniffer v1.0.0
        
        ## About
        
        This sniffer is based on http://github.com/xupeng/redis-sa
        
        This tool will monitor a specific port and interface for redis traffic and captures the commands being sent to Redis and/or formatted full TCP dump data.  This can be used for analysis for debugging or for replaying the transactions as a way of doing real load/performance testing.
        
        Redis Sniffer must be run locally on a Redis server.
