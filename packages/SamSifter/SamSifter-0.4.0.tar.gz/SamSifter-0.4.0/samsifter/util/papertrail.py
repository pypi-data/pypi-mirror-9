    @PG entries in SAM file headers can be chained by linking each entry to the
    previously applied program using the optional PP tag. The actual last entry
    of the chain can only be found under the assumption that all programs are
    listed within one chain.

    Note
    ----
    May lead to wrong assumptions about the actual order of programs applied to
    dataset if the chain of PG entries is interrupted by missing PP tags. Use
    at own risk!

    Parameters
    ----------
    current_id : str
        Unique ID of program entry that serves as arbitrary start point for the
        recursive search of the chain end.
    pg_entries : dict of dicts
        Dictionary of @PG record tags (key:value) referenced by their unique
        program ID.
