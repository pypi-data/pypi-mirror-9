Usage
-----
To start using the application, you should create new `Source` object via admin interface. There, please enter following information:
    
* `url` - URL to the start page of `source` (website, entry list,...)
* `name` - Name of the source to be crawled
* `link_xpath` - XPath links of main content page (entries, articles,...)
* `expand rules` - XPath to url values of next scraping session(s) ~ higher depth
* `crawl_depth` - Max depth of scraping session. This relates to expand rules
* `content_xpath` - XPath to the target value of content page (article body,...)
* `content_type` - Type of the current `source`
* `meta_xpath` - XPath dictionary of meta-data information will extracted along the main content

    *Example:*
        
        {
            'title': '//h1[@class="title"]/text()',
            'keywords': 'keywords': '//meta[@name="keywords"]/@content',
        }
* `extra_xpath` - XPath to additional content that will be downloaded (PDF files, video clips,...)
* `refine_rules` - RegEx List of regular expressions will be applied to content to remove redundant data. Each regex stays in one different line.

    *Example:*
        
        <div class="tags".*$
        <br/?>

* `active` - Determine if this `source` will run or not
* `download_image` - Check this to download all images present inside the specified content
* `black_words` - Select set of words, a content will not be downloaded if containing one of those words
* `proxy` - Proxy server will be used when crawling current source
* `user_agent` - User Agent value set in the header of every requests

After being saved, the `source` object will run a scraping session by calling crawl() method:

    source_object.crawl()

or under console, by running management command `run_scraper`:
    
    python manage.py run_scraper
    
With this command, all active sources inside current Django instance will be processed consecutively.
