        ##Documentation
        
        A really good place to understand what is `brainy` is to read the *user manual*:
        
          * [User manual](https://github.com/pelkmanslab/brainy/wiki/User-Manual)
          * [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/pelkmanslab/brainy/wiki/Developer-Documentation)
           
          > Tip: get help about the commands you need by saying `brainy help` or `brainy help project`
        
        
        ##Getting started
        
        Create you first project
        
        ```
        brainy create project PureAwesomeness --from demo
        ```
        
        Go inside the project folder and adjust settings in your pipelines. Afterwards run the project.
        
        ```
        cd PureAwesomeness
        # Adjust settings in .brainy <project settings> and hello.br <pipe description> YAML files
        brainy run project
        ```
        
        To see the report in your local web browser, do 
        ```
        brainy ui serve
        ```
        
        If things are looking good, continue by submitting your project into the *cloud*. Find out how to do this in the [Cloud](https://github.com/pelkmanslab/brainy/wiki/User-Manual#Cloud) section of the brainy's User Manual. 
        
        ##Installation
        
        >It is recommended to use [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) as python 2.7+ environment.
        
        The package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/brainy-mind/).
        
        > On Mac: brew install libyaml
        
        ```
        pip install brainy-mind
        ```
        
        Once installed, make sure you put a config file into your ~/.brainy/config folder by calling
        
        ```
        brainy init config
        ```
        
        You will have to edit the template that has been copied according to your cluster scheduler settings and so on.
        
        > Supported OS/platforms are **Linux** and **Mac OSX**.
