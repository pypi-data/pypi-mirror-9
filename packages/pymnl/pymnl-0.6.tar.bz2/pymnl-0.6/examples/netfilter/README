README

As I do not use netfilter and do not have it in my kernel, I am unable to
run libmnl's netfilter examples.  I have no plans to implement the
netfilter examples using pymnl.

If you, gentle reader, would care to write nf-log.py, nf-queue.py,
nfct-create-batch.py, and/or nfct-event.py, and would like to distribute
it under a FOSS license, I would be happy to include them in future
releases of pymnl.
