ROADMAP
=======

There is no timeline associated with the following schedule.  Release
dates are dependent on user feedback, bugs I find while trying to
develop with pymnl, and the time I can find to implement fixes.

v0.1 - first release - released Mar 14, 2011
        Alpha version to get initial feedback from other developers.
        Wild API changes allowed.

v0.5 - second release - released Apr 17, 2011
        Beta version with more complete test cases and examples.  Include
        fixes for bugs found by testing.  Minimal API changes allowed.

v0.5 - second release - released Mar 22, 2015
        Beta version with improved documentation.  Include fixes for bugs
        found by testing.  Minimal API changes allowed.

v0.9 - fourth release
        Beta version.  Mostly complete.  Only vital API changes allowed.
        Mainly bug fixes between here and 1.0 release.

v1.0 - fifth release
        Stable version.  Fixed API.

Beyond the 1.0 release should only be 1.0.x point releases for bug fixes.
Unless some dramatic change is required for Python or Netlink changes,
there will not be a 2.0 release.
