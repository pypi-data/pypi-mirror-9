Description: Convenience functions and classes for files and filenames/pathnames.
        ====================================================================
        
        * Pathname: subclass of str with convenience properties useful for pathnames
        
        * BackedFile: a RawIOBase implementation that uses a backing file for initial data and writes new data to a front file
        
        * SharedAppendFile: a base class to share a modifiable file between multiple users
        
        * SharedAppendLines: a subclass of SharedAppendFile which shares updates in units oftext lines
        
        * FileState: a signature object for a file state derived from os.stat or os.lstat or os.fstat; has .mtime, .size, .dev and .ino attributes
        
        * abspath_from_file: restore relative path with respect to another path, as for an include filename
        
        * chunks_of: generator yielding text or data from an open file until EOF
        
        * lines_of: generator yielding lines of text from an open file until EOF
        
        * compare: compare two filenames or file-like objects for content equality
        
        * @file_property: decorator for a caching property whose value is recomputed if the file changes
        
        * make_file_property: constructor for variants on @file_property
        
        * @files_property: decorator for a caching property whose value is recomputed if any of a set of files changes
        
        * make_files_property: constructor for variants on @files_property
        
        * lockfile: context manager to take a lock file around an operation, such as access to a shared file
        
        * shortpath: return `path` with the first matching leading prefix replaced with short form such as "~/" or "$LOGDIR/" etc
        
        * longpath: the inverse of shortpath
        
        * mkdirn: create a new directory named path+sep+n, where `n` exceeds any name already present
        
        * poll_file: watch a file for modification by polling its state as obtained by FileState
        
        * rewrite: rewrite the content of a file if changed; with an assortment of modes
        
        * rewrite_cmgr: a context manager made from rewrite()
