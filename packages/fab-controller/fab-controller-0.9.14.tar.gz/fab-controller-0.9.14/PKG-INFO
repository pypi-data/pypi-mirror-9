Description: FAB! The Forgione-Avent-Barber Finger Pressure Stimulator
        =========================================================
        
        This repository contains the control software for the new
        Forgione-Avent-Barber (FAB) finger pressure stimulator. Details of the
        original Forgione Barber (FB) device [Forgione1971]_ `are
        here <static/ForgioneBarber1971.pdf>`__. The FAB updates the original
        design to allow for indepenent computer control of pressure stimulation
        of each hand, allowing for a much greater range of experimental designs
        (e.g. deceptive or conditioned placebo designs).
        
        
        
        
        
        Background and rationale for the new design
        --------------------------------------------------
        
        Studies of pain and placebo analgesia have historically used a wide
        variety of stimuli as laborotory analogues including electrical stimuli
        [Wager2004]_, cold water (i.e. a cold pressor;
        [Posner1985]_), heat [Ptrovic2002]_, iontophorensis
        [Montgomery1997]_, lasers [Bingel2006]_, and pressure
        [Whalley2008]_.
        
        Pain stimuli for laborotory studies can be evaluated on a number of
        dimensions: the *reliability* of the stimuli (in the sense the same stimuli
        can be delivered consistently); *validity* of the stimuli, in the sense
        that it corresponds to real world pain experiences; *repeatability*, in
        the sense that multiple stimuli can be given in a single experiment;
        whether *deception* is possible --- that is, whether participants can be
        convincingly misinformed about the stimuli to be delivered (this would, for exaple, allow placebo-conditioning studies to take place, e.g. @montgomery1997classical); and
        the *expense* and *practicality* of the techniques — for example whether
        the equipment can be used by students without additional supervision.

        Focal pressure, applied to the skin over bone, is a method of evoking
        experimental pain of an 'aching' nature. The experienced sensation is
        relatively closely related to the pressure applied, and many studies of
        pain and placebo analgesia use pressure stimuli because they are cheap,
        practical, reliable and have reasonable ecological validity (see Table
        for a comparison of the different types of pain stimulator available).
        The FB device is used to apply pressure to the fingers via lever [Forgione1971]_, see figure.  However, three important limitations of the original FB device are that 
        
        1. it is impossible to deceive pariticpants as to the true magnitude of the
        stimulus to be delivered, ruling out conditioning studies
        2. it is impossible to blind experimenters to the stimuli to be delivered (e.g. via computer control), and that 
        3. the reliability of pain measurements is limited by the resolution of pain self report scales.
        
        The FAB is designed to resolve all three of these limitations.

        The FAB: Hardware
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The FAB is based on cheap, readily available hardware (an Arduino
        microcontroller and widely-available pressure-sensors) and the key
        mechanical components are 3D printed and can be assembled by lab
        technicians. Ready-assembled units are also be available to buy.
        
        More details, including circuit diagrams, schematics, and CAD files
        sufficient to enable 3d-printing and assembly of a device, will be
        available soon under a permissive open source license.
        
        
        The piston
          The key mechanical component is a 3D-printed piston which contains 2kg of
          ballast and a linear motor to drive the probe which makes contact with the participants finger.
          As the linear motor drives the probe downwards and makes contact with the finger
          the piston is lifted from a rest position, but the maximum weight which can be applied to
          the probe remains 2kg [#grams]_. 
        
        Arduino microcontroller and sensors
          An arduino microcontroller is used to drive the linear actuators and capture data from 
          two load cells mounted within the pistons (between the probe and the motor). These data are fed
          to a controlling PC via the `Firmata <http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ serial protocol.

        Software
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The system includes two software components which communicate via a USB
        serial link:
        
        -  This control software, which runs on a host computer and provides a
           user interface via a web browser.
        
        -  The open source Standard `Firmata <http://firmata.org>`__ firmware,
           which runs on the embedded controller inside the device. This is
           pre-installed on ready-assembled devices.
        
        
        
        
        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The software should work on both Mac and PC - the primary dependencies
        are a recent version of Python plus a C compiler (needed to install the
        python-gevent library).
        
        
        
        On OS X (or BSD/Linux)
        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
        
        1. Install XCode from the Mac App Store (you can skip this if you
           already have a working C compiler on your linux system).
        
        2. Open the Terminal app (in the /Applications/Utilities folder).
        
        3. If you don't already have pip_ installed, type ``sudo easy_install pip``
        
        
        .. _pip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        
        
          And then to install the software: ``pip install fab-controller``
        
        
        4. To start using the FAB device, type the command: ``fab``
        
        
        .. note: If all is well this will open a web browser window with the interface to the device. 
        
        
        
        
        
        On Windows
        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
        
        1. Ensure you have GCC, Python and pip installed.
        
        2. Repeat the steps above.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        User guide
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        
        
        Getting started
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        1. Connect both the DC power input and the USB cables.
        2. Run the ``fab`` command from the Terminal.
        
        
        On running the ``fab`` command, a browser window will open containing
        the user interface for the FAB device, shown below.
        
        .. figure:: static/manual.png?raw=true
           :alt: The FAB user interface
        
           The FAB user interface
        The device has 3 primary modes of use:
        
        -  Manual control
        -  Programmed control
        -  Calibration mode
        
        
        
        Target weights and tracking
        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
        
        In both manual and programmed control, the interface distinguishes
        between:
        
        -  Target value for the weight[#grams]_  applied to each hand.
        -  The actual measurements recorded by the sensor [#actualforce]_.
        
        
        .. [#actualforce] Note that the exact pressure applied to the finger will vary as a function of the contact area, and can only be estimated based on the width of the finger, but will be broadly similar between participants.
        
        
        Targets can be set in 'grams' for each hand[#grams]_. Once a target has been set
        the control software moves the probes up and down, attempting to
        maintain the target weight, as measured by the sensor. Thus where
        participants flex or move their fingers, the system will attempt to
        compensate to keep the measured force constant.
        
        
        
        Manual control
        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
        
        Using the slider controls under the 'manual' tab, you can set a target
        weight in grams for each hand.
        
        
        .. figure:: static/manual.png?raw=true
           :alt: Manual control interface
        
        
        
        Programmed control
        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
        
        .. figure:: static/programmed.png?raw=true
           :alt: Program interface
        
        
        Programs for blocks of stimuli can be entered in the text area. Programs
        are simple lists of comma-separated integers. The first column specifies
        the duration, the second the target in grams for the left hand, and the
        third the target for the right hand. So, the following lines:
        
        ::
        
            20,500,500
            10,1000,2000
        
        Denote a program which will deliver 500g to both hands for 20 seconds,
        and then 1000g to the left and 2000g to the right hands for 10 seconds.
        
        At the end of a program target weights are set to zero.
        
        
        
        Get set, Stop and Reset buttons.
        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
        
        -  The get set button sets the target for both hands to 20g. This allows
           a participant to find a comfortable position, and for program to
           begin from a common reference point.
        -  The stop button will always stop any program or manual setting, and
           reduce the target weights to zero. Additionally, the probes will be
           moved approx 1mm upwards to give the participant space to move their
           fingers.
        -  The reset button moves both probes to their top resting points.
        
        
        
        
        
        Instructions for participants
        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
        
        
        .. note:: In addition to standard reminders that participants are free to withdraw from experiments at any time, participants in studies using the FAB should be explictly reminded that **if they wish to stop the study at any time they should simply remove their hands from the device by pulling backwards**.
        
        
        The probes in contact with the participants' fingers are attached using magnets to ensure it will always be possible with only very moderate horzontal force, and it is recommended to demonstrate this feature to participants at the very start of the session.
        
        
        
        
        
        Logging and data capture
        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
        
        By default, log files will be saved into ``~/Documents/fab/logs/``.
        
        The current log file name change be changed (e.g. per-participant) in the 'Detailed Log' tab, next to the console.
        
        
        
        
        
        Troubleshooting and known issues
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        
        
        
        Software hangs on start-up
          The device must start in a position where neither piston is activating the top-stop micro-switch. If the switch is depressed on startup the server may hang. The workaround is to remove power from the device and pull both pistons gently downwards approx 3 mm.
