Description: cjdnsadmin For Python 3
        =======================
        
        |Build Status| |Code Health| |PyPI|
        
        The cjdns python library doesn't support python3 and is a PITA to
        install, due to it's use of a modified bencode library which is still
        called "bencode", among other things, so I'm cleaning it up.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to install it is:
        
        ::
        
            pip install cjdnsadmin
        
        But you could also clone it and run:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Once it's installed, you'll find ``peerStats`` and ``cexec`` installed
        in your ``$PATH``, and the ``cjdnsadmin`` library available for import.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Usage is simple. First, import:
        
        ::
        
            import cjdnsadmin
        
        Then, connect to the running cjdns instance. There are two ways to do
        this. The normal way is to use the ``~/.cjdnsadmin`` file:
        
        ::
        
            cjdns = cjdnsadmin.connectWithAdminInfo()
        
        Or, if you have the IP, port and password and wish to ignore the
        ``~/.cjdnsadmin`` file for whatever reason:
        
        ::
        
            cjdns = cjdnsadmin.connect(ip, port, password)
        
        Once connected, you may call any of the `cjdns admin interface
        functions <https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/admin/README.md#cjdns-functions>`__:
        
        ::
        
            peerStats = cjdns.InterfaceController_peerStats()
        
        Finally, there is a helper function that allows one to convert a cjdns
        public key into an IP address:
        
        ::
        
            cjdnsadmin.PublicToIp6('1rfp3guz4jjhfu4dsu5mrz68f7fyp502wcttq6b78xdrjhd4ru80.k')

        Contributing
        ============
        
        I welcome pull requests, please make sure that everything you contribute
        is pep8 compliant and works on python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. There
        are some basic tests in place for these things via Travis, but they're
        not complete by any means.
