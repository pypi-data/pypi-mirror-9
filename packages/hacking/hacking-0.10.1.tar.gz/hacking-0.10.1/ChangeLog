* Fix pep8 violation
* See description of change... what's the difference between that message and this message again?
* Simpler installation, and, can run install_venv from anywhere instead of just from checkout root
* Make WSGI routing support routing to WSGI apps or to controller+action
* updated virtualenv to add eventlet, which is now a requirement
* Changes the run_tests.sh and /tools/install_venv.py scripts to be more user-friendly and not depend on PIP while not in the virtual environment
* work on a router that works with wsgi and non-wsgi routing
* Oops, we need eventlet as well
* Quick fix on location of printouts when trying to install virtualenv
* Changes the run_tests.sh and /tools/install_venv.py scripts to be more user-friendly and not depend on PIP while not in the virtual environment. Running run_tests.sh should not just work out of the box on all systems supporting easy_install..
* 2 changes in doing PEP8 & Pylint cleaning: * adding pep8 and pylint to the PIP requirements files for Tools * light cleaning work (mostly formatting) on nova/endpoints/cloud.py
* Run correctly even if called while in tools/ directory, as 'python install_venv.py'
* Greater compliance with pep8/pylint style checks
* adding pep8 and pylint for regular cleanup tasks
* Added Cheetah to pip-requires
* Added exit code checking to process.py (twisted process utils). A bit of class refactoring to make it work & cleaner. Also added some more instructive messages to install_venv.py, because otherwise people that don't know what they're doing will install the wrong pip... i.e. I did :-)
* resolving conflict w/ merge, cleaning up virtenv setups
* Fixes to the virtualenv installer
* Move virtualenv installation out of the makefile
* Adds a Makefile to fill dependencies for testing
* update copyrights
* Removed trailing whitespace from header
* Updated licenses
