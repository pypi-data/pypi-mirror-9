twitter\_markov
===============

Create markov chain ("\_ebooks") accounts on Twitter

The audience for this library is those with at least basic Python
experience. Before you set this up, you'll need:

-  A twitter account
-  A twitter application (register at
   `dev.twitter.com <http://dev.twitter.com>`__) with authentication
   keys for the account (`read more <https://dev.twitter.com/oauth>`__)
-  A corpus for the bot to learn, which can be a text file or a Twitter
   archive. Several thousand lines are needed to get decent results

Install
-------

Run ``pip install twitter_markov``, or download/clone the package and
run ``python setup.py install``. Feel free to use a virtualenv, if
you're into that.

Brain Train
-----------

Train the brain with the ``twittermarkov_learn`` command.

The ``twittermarkov_learn`` comes with options to ignore replies or
retweets, and to filter out mentions, urls, media, and/or hashtags.

When reading an archive, these arguments use the tweet's metadata to
precisely strip the offending content. This may not work well for tweets
posted before 2011 or so. For text files or older tweets, a regular
expression search is used.

.. code:: bash

    # Usage is twittermarkov_learn ARCHIVE BRAIN
    $ twittermarkov learn twitter/archive/path archive.brain

    # teach the brain from a text file
    $ twittermarkov learn --txt file.txt txt.brain

    $ twittermarkov_learn --no-replies twitter/archive/path archive-no-replies.brain
    # Text like this will be ignored:
    # @sample I ate a sandwich

    # Text like this will be read in:
    # I ate a sandwich with @sample

If you're using a Twitter archive, the ARCHIVE argument should be the
top-level folder of the archive (usually a long name like
16853453\_3f21d17c73166ef3c77d7994c880dd93a8159c88). If you have a text
file, the argument should be a file name

Config
------

See the
`bots.yaml <https://github.com/fitnr/twitter_markov/blob/master/bots.yaml>`__
file for a full list of settings. Plug your settings in and save the
file as ``bots.yaml`` to your home directory or ``~/bots``. You can also
use JSON, if that's your thing.

At a minimum, your config file will need to look like this:

.. code:: yaml

    apps:
        example_app_name:
            consumer_key: ...
            consumer_secret: ...

    users:
        example_screen_name:

            key: ...
            secret: ...

            app: example_app_name

            # If you want your bot to continue to learn, include this
            parent: your_screen_name

Read up on `dev.twitter.com <https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview>`__
on obtaining authentication tokens.

First Tweet
-----------

Tweeting is easy. By default, the ``twittermarkov`` command line
application will learn recent tweets from your parent and send one
tweet.

After that, use:

.. code:: bash

    $ twittermarkov tweet --no-learn example_screen_name

To have your bot reply to mentions, use:

.. code:: bash

    $ twittermarkov tweet --reply example_screen_name

To have your bot reply to mentions, use:

.. code:: bash

    $ twittermarkov tweet --reply example_screen_name

If you don't want to bot to learn from the parent account, use

.. code:: bash

    $ twittermarkov tweet --no-learn example_screen_name

The learning also won't happen if twittermarkov can't find it's previous
tweets, which might happen if there are problems with the Twitter API,
or your \_ebooks account has never tweeted.

Automating
----------

On a \*nix system, set up a cron job like so:

::

    0 10-20 * * * twittermarkov tweet example_screen_name
    15,45 10-20 * * * twittermarkov tweet --reply example_screen_name

API
---

If you want to write a script to expand on twitter\_markov, you'll find
a fairly simple set of tools.

*class twitter\_markov.Twitter\_markov(screen\_name, brains=None,
config=None, api=None)*

-  screen\_name - Twitter user account
-  brains - Path to a brain file, or a list of paths. If omitted,
   Twitter\_markov looks in its config for a ``brains`` entry.
-  config - A dictionary of configuration settings. But default,
   twitter\_markov will try to read this from the bots.yaml file (see
   above)/
-  api - A tweepy-like API object. In the twitter\_markov class, this is
   a ``twitter_bot_utils.API`` object.

The first brain in brains (or in the config file) will be the default
brain.

Properties: \* recently\_tweeted - A list of the 20 (or
``config['checkback']``) most recent tweets from ``self.screen_name``.

Methods:

-  ``check_tweet(text)``: Check if a string contains blacklisted words
   or is similar to a recent tweet.
-  ``reply(status, brainname=None): Compose a reply to the given``\ tweepy.Status\`.
   Brainname could refer to the filename of a given brain (for instance,
   "special" for the brain stored at "dir/special.brain").
-  ``reply_all(brainname=None)``: Reply to all mentions since the last
   time ``self.screen_name`` sent a reply tweet.
-  ``compose(catalyst='', brainname=None, max_len=140)``: Returns a
   string generated "brainname" (or the default brain).
-  ``tweet(catylyst='', brainname=None)``: Post a tweet composed by
   giving "catalyst" to "brainname" (or the default brain).
-  ``learn_parent(brainname=None)``: Learn recent tweets (since the last
   time ``self.screen_name`` tweeted) by the parent account. This is
   subject to the filters described in ``bots.yaml``.
