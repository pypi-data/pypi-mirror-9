  <h1>ZODB Browser</h1>
</div>

  <h3>What's it for?</h3>

  <p>ZODB Browser lets you see the objects as they're stored in the ZODB.
  You can view the current state as well as any historical state that hasn't
  been removed from the ZODB packing.  You can click on hyperlinks to
  jump from persistent object to persistent object.</p>

  <h3>Breadcrumbs</h3>

  <p>The object path displayed at the top is constructed from
  <tt>__parent__</tt> and <tt>__name__</tt> attributes.  When there is
  a missing __name__ or __parent__, you'll see ??? displayed in its place.
  You can click on each part of the name, as well as on the leading slash,
  to go to that particular object</p>

  <h3>Advanced navigation</h3>

  <p>You can click to the area right of the breadcrumbs (or press g) to
  activate the go-to bar.  In it you can type an object path and press Enter
  to go to that object (pressing Esc or clicking anywhere outside the
  go-to bar hides it).  Object paths try to follow attributes and items;
  special paths (such as Zope's ++namespace++ syntax) are not supported.
  </p>

  <p>If you know an object's OID (hex or converted to a base-10 integer), you
  can go directly to that object by going to <tt>@@zodbbrowser?oid=1234</tt>
  (or <tt>@@zodbbrowser?oid=0x01234</tt>).
  This is the only way to reach <a href="@@zodbbrowser?oid=0">object 0</a>,
  which is the persistent mapping at the ZODB root. </p>

  <h3>History browsing</h3>

  <p>If you click on any of the transaction record headings, that record it
  will become highlighted in yellow.  From there on, all object attributes
  and items at the top will show information that was current at the time
  of the selected transaction.  This state will stick even when navigating
  to other objects.  As a reminder, there will appear a small yellow bar
  in the heading area.  To clear it and go back to always seeing the current
  state of the objects, click on 'Latest' in the history list.</p>

  <p>You can also click on 'view transaction record' to find all other objects
  that were modified in the same transaction, or view nearby transactions.</p>

  <p>At the moment there's no convenient link to view the <a
  href="@@zodbbrowser_history">latest 5 transactions</a> in the database,
  (other than this one).</p>

  <h3>Filtering by attribute</h3>

  <p>You can hide changes to uninteresting attributes in the history list by
  unchecking checkboxes next to attribute names.  Click on "show all" to
  remove the filtering and display all attributes.</p>

  <p>In some cases (e.g. when attributes have been removed from the object),
  checking all check boxes may show less than clicking on "show all".</p>
