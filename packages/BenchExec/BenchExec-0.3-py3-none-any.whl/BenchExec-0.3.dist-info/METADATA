BenchExec
=========

A Framework for Reliable Benchmarking and Resource Measurement
--------------------------------------------------------------

|Build Status|

BenchExec provides three major features:

-  execution of arbitrary commands with precise and reliable measurement
   and limitation of resource usage (e.g., CPU time and memory)
-  an easy way to define benchmarks with specific tool configurations
   and resource limits, and automatically executing them on large sets
   of input files
-  generation of interactive tables and plots for the results

Contrary to other benchmarking frameworks, it is able to reliably
measure and limit resource usage of the benchmarked tool even if it
spawns subprocesses. In order to achieve this, it uses the `cgroups
feature <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt>`__
of the Linux kernel to correctly handle groups of processes. BenchExec
allows to measure CPU time, wall time, and memory usage of a tool, and
to specify limits for these resources. It also allows to limit the CPU
cores and (on NUMA systems) memory regions. In addition to measuring
resource usage, BenchExec can verify that the result of the tool was as
expected, and extract further statistical data from the output. Results
from multiple runs can be combined into CSV and interactive HTML tables,
of which the latter provide scatter and quantile plots.

BenchExec is intended for benchmarking non-interactive tools on Linux
systems. It was originally developed for use with the software
verification framework `CPAchecker <http://cpachecker.sosy-lab.org>`__.

BenchExec was successfully used for benchmarking in all four instances
of the `International Competition on Software
Verification <http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org>`__ with a wide variety of
benchmarked tools and hundreds of thousands benchmark runs.

BenchExec is developed at the `Software Systems
Lab <http://www.sosy-lab.org>`__ at the `University of
Passau <http://www.uni-passau.de>`__.
