    "HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable", 
    "to determine\nwhich requests are performed by which client, and which", 
    "clients are authenticated\nor unauthenticated.\n\nThe use of HTTP cookies", 
    "within the headers, allows a web server to identify each\nindividual", 
    "client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid", 
    "authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session", 
    "cookies.\n\nWhen a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an", 
    "HTTP response) there\nare several flags that can be set to configure", 
    "the properties of the cookie and\nhow it is to be handled by the", 
    "browser.\n\nOne of these flags represents the host, or domain. for which", 
    "the cookie can be used.\n\nWhen the cookie is set for the parent domain,", 
    "rather than the host, this could\nindicate that the same cookie could", 
    "be used to access other hosts within that domain.\nWhile there are many", 
    "legitimate reasons for this, it could also be misconfiguration", 
    "expanding the possible surface of attacks."

      "The first step to remediation is to identify the context in which the",

      "domain, or just the\nspecific host being tested.\n\nIf it is only", 
      "required by the host, then the domain flag should be set as such.", 
      "Depending on the framework being used, the configuration of this flag", 
      "will be\nmodified in different ways."
