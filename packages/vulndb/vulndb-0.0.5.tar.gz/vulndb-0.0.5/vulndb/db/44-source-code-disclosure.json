    "A modern web application will be reliant on several different", 
    "programming languages.\n\nThese languages can be broken up in two", 
    "flavours. These are client-side languages\n(such as those that run in", 
    "the browser -- like JavaScript) and server-side\nlanguages (which are", 
    "executed by the server -- like ASP, PHP, JSP, etc.) to form\nthe", 
    "dynamic pages (client-side code) that are then sent to the client.", 
    "Because all server side code should be executed by the server, it", 
    "should never be\nseen by the client. However in some scenarios, it is", 
    "possible that:\n\n1. The server side code has syntax errors and", 
    "therefore is not executed by the\n    server but is instead sent to the", 
    "client.\n2. Using crafted requests it is possible to force the server", 
    "into displaying the\n    source code of the application without", 
    "executing it.\n\nAs the server-side source code often contains sensitive", 
    "information, such as\ndatabase connection strings or details into the", 
    "application workflow, this can be\nextremely risky.\n\nCyber-criminals", 
    "will attempt to discover pages that either accidentally or\nforcefully", 
    "allow the server-side source code to be disclosed, to assist in", 
    "discovering further vulnerabilities or sensitive information.\n\nThe tool", 
    "has detected server-side source code within the server's response.", 
    "_(False positives may occur when requesting binary files such as", 
    "images\n(.JPG or .PNG) and may require manual verification.)_"
