    "To perform specific actions from within a web application, it is", 
    "occasionally\nrequired to run Operating System commands and have the", 
    "output of these commands\ncaptured by the web application and returned", 
    "to the client.\n\nOS command injection occurs when user supplied input", 
    "is inserted into one of these\ncommands without proper sanitisation and", 
    "is then executed by the server.\n\nCyber-criminals will abuse this", 
    "weakness to perform their own arbitrary commands\non the server. This", 
    "can include everything from simple `ping` commands to map the\ninternal", 
    "network, to obtaining full control of the server.\n\nThe tool was able to", 
    "inject specific Operating System commands and have the output\nfrom", 
    "that command contained within the server response. This indicates that", 
    "proper\ninput sanitisation is not occurring."
