    "HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol; therefore, the server is", 
    "unable to\ndetermine which requests are performed by which client and", 
    "which clients are\nauthenticated or unauthenticated.\n\nThe use of HTTP", 
    "cookies within the headers allows a web server to identify each", 
    "individual client and can thus determine which clients hold valid", 
    "authentication\nfrom those that do not.\nThese are known as session", 
    "cookies or session tokens.\n\nTo prevent clients from being able to", 
    "guess each other's session token, each\nassigned session token should", 
    "be entirely random and be different whenever a\nsession is established", 
    "with the server.\n\nSession fixation occurs when the client is able to", 
    "specify their own session\ntoken value and the value of the session", 
    "cookie is not changed by the server\nafter successful authentication.", 
    "Occasionally, the session token will also remain unchanged for the", 
    "user independently\nof how many times they have authenticated.", 
    "Cyber-criminals will abuse this functionality by sending crafted URL", 
    "links with a\npredetermined session token within the link. The", 
    "cyber-criminal will then wait\nfor the victim to login and become", 
    "authenticated.\nIf successful, the cyber-criminal will know a valid", 
    "session ID and therefore have\naccess to the victim's session.\n\nThe tool", 
    "has discovered that it is able to set its own session token."
