    "The `TRACE` HTTP method allows a client so send a request to the", 
    "server, and\nhave the same request then send back in the server's", 
    "response. This allows the\nclient to determine if the server is", 
    "receiving the request as expected or if\nspecific parts of the request", 
    "are not arriving as expected.\nFor example incorrect encoding or a load", 
    "balancer has filtered or changed a value.\nOn many default", 
    "installations the `TRACE` method is still enabled.\n\nWhile not", 
    "vulnerable by itself, it does provide a method for cyber-criminals to", 
    "bypass the `HTTPOnly` cookie flag, and therefore could allow a XSS", 
    "attack to\nsuccessfully access a session token.\n\nThe tool has discovered", 
    "that the affected page permits the HTTP `TRACE` method."

      "The HTTP `TRACE` method is normally not required within production",

      "being performed by the web application, the risk\nlevel can start low", 
      "and increase as more functionality is implemented.\n\nThe remediation is", 
      "typically a very simple configuration change and in most cases\nwill", 
      "not have any negative impact on the server or application."
