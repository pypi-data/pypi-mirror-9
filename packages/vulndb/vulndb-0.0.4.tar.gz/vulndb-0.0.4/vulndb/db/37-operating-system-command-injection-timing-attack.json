    "To perform specific actions from within a web application, it is", 
    "occasionally\nrequired to run Operating System commands and have the", 
    "output of these commands\ncaptured by the web application and returned", 
    "to the client.\n\nOS command injection occurs when user supplied input", 
    "is inserted into one of these\ncommands without proper sanitisation and", 
    "is then executed by the server.\n\nCyber-criminals will abuse this", 
    "weakness to perform their own arbitrary commands\non the server. This", 
    "can include everything from simple `ping` commands to map the\ninternal", 
    "network, to obtaining full control of the server.\n\nBy injecting OS", 
    "commands that take a specific amount of time to execute, the tool\nwas", 
    "able to detect time based OS command injection. This indicates that", 
    "proper\ninput sanitisation is not occurring."
