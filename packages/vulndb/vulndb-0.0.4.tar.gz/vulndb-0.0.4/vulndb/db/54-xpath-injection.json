    "XML Path Language (XPath) queries are used by web applications for", 
    "selecting\nnodes from XML documents.\nOnce selected, the value of these", 
    "nodes can then be used by the application.\n\nA simple example for the", 
    "use of XML documents is to store user information. As\npart of the", 
    "authentication process, the application will perform an XPath query\nto", 
    "confirm the login credentials and retrieve that user's information to", 
    "use in\nthe following request.\n\nXPath injection occurs where untrusted", 
    "data is used to build XPath queries.\n\nCyber-criminals may abuse this", 
    "injection vulnerability to bypass authentication,\nquery other user's", 
    "information, or, if the XML document contains privileged user", 
    "credentials, allow the cyber-criminal to escalate their privileges.",

    "based on the\nresponses from the server, has determined that the page",

      "The preferred way to protect against XPath injection is to utilise", 
      "parameterized\n(also known as prepared) XPath queries.\nWhen utilising", 
      "this method of querying the XML document any value supplied by the", 
      "client will be handled as a string rather than part of the XPath",
