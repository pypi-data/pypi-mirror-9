    "HTTP response splitting occurs when untrusted data is inserted into", 
    "the response\nheaders without any sanitisation.\n\nIf successful, this", 
    "allows cyber-criminals to essentially split the HTTP response\nin two.", 
    "This is abused by cyber-criminals injecting CR (Carriage Return --", 
    "`/r`)\nand LF (Line Feed -- `\\n`) characters which will then form the", 
    "split. If the CR\nor LF characters are not processed by the server then", 
    "it cannot be exploited.\n\nAlong with these characters, cyber-criminals", 
    "can then construct their own\narbitrary response headers and body which", 
    "would then form the second response.\nThe second response is entirely", 
    "under their control, allowing for a number of\nother attacks."
