    "already\ndiscovered on the webserver. By analysing the response headers", 
    "from the server\nthey are able to determine if a backup directory", 
    "exists.\nThese backup directories can then assist in the compromise of", 
    "the web application.\n\nBy utilising the same method, the tool was able",
