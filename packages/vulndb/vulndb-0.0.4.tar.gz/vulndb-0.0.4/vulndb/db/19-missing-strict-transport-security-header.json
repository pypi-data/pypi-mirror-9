    "The HTTP protocol by itself is clear text, meaning that any data that", 
    "is\ntransmitted via HTTP can be captured and the contents viewed. To", 
    "keep data\nprivate and prevent it from being intercepted, HTTP is often", 
    "tunnelled through\neither Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer", 
    "Security (TLS).\nWhen either of these encryption standards are used, it", 
    "is referred to as HTTPS.\n\nHTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is an", 
    "optional response header that can be\nconfigured on the server to", 
    "instruct the browser to only communicate via HTTPS.\nThis will be", 
    "enforced by the browser even if the user requests a HTTP resource\non", 
    "the same server.\n\nCyber-criminals will often attempt to compromise", 
    "sensitive information passed\nfrom the client to the server using HTTP.", 
    "This can be conducted via various\nMan-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or", 
    "through network packet captures.\n\nThe tool discovered that the affected", 
    "application is using HTTPS however does not\nuse the HSTS header."
