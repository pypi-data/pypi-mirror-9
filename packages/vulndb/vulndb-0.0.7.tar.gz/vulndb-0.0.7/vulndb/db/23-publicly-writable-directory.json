    "There are various methods in which a file (or files) may be uploaded",

    "The `PUT` method is mainly used during development of applications and", 
    "allows developers to upload (or put) files on the server within the", 
    "web root.\n\nBy nature of the design, the `PUT` method typically does", 
    "not provide any filtering and therefore allows sever side executable", 
    "code (PHP, ASP, etc) to be uploaded to the server.\n\nCyber-criminals", 
    "will search for servers supporting the `PUT` method with the intention", 
    "of modifying existing pages, or uploading web shells to take control", 
    "of the server.\n\nThe tool has discovered that the affected path allows", 
    "clients to use the `PUT` method. During this test, the tool has `PUT` a", 
    "file on the server within the web root and successfully performed a", 
    "`GET` request to its location and verified the contents."

      "the `PUT` method is required to meet application functionality, such", 
      "as REST style web services, strict limitations should be implemented",
