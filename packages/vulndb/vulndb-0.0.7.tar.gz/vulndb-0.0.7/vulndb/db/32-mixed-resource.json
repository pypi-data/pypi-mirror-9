    "The HTTP protocol by itself is clear text, meaning that any data that",

    "keep data private and prevent it from being intercepted, HTTP is often",
    "tunnelled through either a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), or Transport", 
    "Layer Security (TLS) connection. When either of these encryption", 
    "standards are used, it is referred to as HTTPS.\n\nCyber-criminals will", 
    "often attempt to compromise sensitive information passed from the", 
    "client to the server using HTTP. This can be conducted via various", 
    "different Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or through network packet", 
    "captures.\n\nThe tool discovered that the affected site is utilising both", 
    "HTTP and HTTPS. While the HTML code is served over HTTPS, the server", 
    "is also serving resources over an unencrypted channel, which can lead", 
    "to the compromise of data, while providing a false sense of security", 
    "to the user."
