    "Web applications occasionally use parameter values to store the", 
    "location of a file\nwhich will later be required by the server.\n\nAn", 
    "example of this is often seen in error pages, where the actual file", 
    "path for\nthe error page is stored in a parameter value -- for example", 
    "`example.com/error.php?page=404.php`.\n\nA file inclusion occurs when", 
    "the parameter value (ie. path to file) can be\nsubstituted with the", 
    "path of another resource on the same server, effectively\nallowing the", 
    "displaying of arbitrary, and possibly restricted/sensitive, files.", 
    "The tool discovered that it was possible to substitute a parameter", 
    "value with another\nresource and have the server return the contents of", 
    "the resource to the client within\nthe response."

      "ensure that the supplied value for a file\nis permitted. This can be", 
      "achieved by performing whitelisting on the parameter\nvalue, by", 
      "matching it against a list of permitted files. If the supplied value", 
      "does not match any value in the whitelist, then the server should", 
      "redirect to a\nstandard error page.\n\nIn some scenarios, where dynamic", 
      "content is being requested, it may not be possible\nto perform", 
      "validation against a list of trusted resources, therefore the list", 
      "must\nalso become dynamic (updated as the files change), or perform", 
      "filtering to remove\nextraneous user input (such as semicolons, periods", 
      "etc.) and only permit `a-z0-9`.\n\nIt is also advised that sensitive", 
      "files are not stored within the web root and\nthat the user permissions",
