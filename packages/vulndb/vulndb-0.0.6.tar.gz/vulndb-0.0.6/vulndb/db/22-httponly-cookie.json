    "HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable", 
    "to determine\nwhich requests are performed by which client, and which", 
    "clients are authenticated\nor unauthenticated.\n\nThe use of HTTP cookies", 
    "within the headers, allows a web server to identify each\nindividual", 
    "client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid", 
    "authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session", 
    "cookies.\n\nWhen a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an", 
    "HTTP response) there\nare several flags that can be set to configure", 
    "the properties of the cookie and\nhow it is to be handled by the", 
    "browser.\n\nThe `HttpOnly` flag assists in the prevention of client", 
    "side-scripts (such as\nJavaScript) accessing and using the cookie.", 
    "This can help prevent XSS attacks targeting the cookies holding the", 
    "client's\nsession token (setting the `HttpOnly` flag does not prevent,", 
    "nor safeguard against\nXSS vulnerabilities themselves)."

      "The initial step to remedy this would be to determine whether any", 
      "client-side\nscripts (such as JavaScript) need to access the cookie and", 
      "if not, set the\n`HttpOnly` flag.\n\nAdditionally, it should be noted", 
      "that some older browsers are not compatible with\nthe `HttpOnly` flag,", 
      "and therefore setting this flag will not protect those clients\nagainst", 
      "this form of attack."
