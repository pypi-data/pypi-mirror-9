  "description": [
    "HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable", 
    "to determine\nwhich requests are performed by which client, and which", 
    "clients are authenticated\nor unauthenticated.\n\nThe use of HTTP cookies", 
    "within the headers, allows a web server to identify each\nindividual", 
    "client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid", 
    "authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session", 
    "cookies.\n\nWhen a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an", 
    "HTTP response) there\nare several flags that can be set to configure", 
    "the properties of the cookie and\nhow it is to be handled by the", 
    "browser.\n\nOne of these flags is known as the `secure` flag. When the", 
    "secure flag is set,\nthe browser will prevent it from being sent over a", 
    "clear text channel (HTTP) and\nonly allow it to be sent when an", 
    "encrypted channel is used (HTTPS).\n\nThe tool discovered that a cookie", 
    "was set by the server without the secure flag\nbeing set. Although the", 
    "initial setting of this cookie was via an HTTPS\nconnection, any HTTP", 
    "link to the same server will result in the cookie being\nsend in clear", 
    "text."

      "however, if the cookie does contain sensitive\ninformation, then the", 
      "server should ensure that the cookie has its `secure` flag set."
