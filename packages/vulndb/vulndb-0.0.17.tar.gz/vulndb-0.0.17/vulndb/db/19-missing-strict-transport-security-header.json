    "The HTTP protocol by itself is clear text, meaning that any data that", 
    "is transmitted via HTTP can be captured and the contents viewed. To", 
    "keep data private and prevent it from being intercepted, HTTP is often", 
    "tunnelled through either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer", 
    "Security (TLS). When either of these encryption standards are used, it", 
    "is referred to as HTTPS.\n\nHTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is an", 
    "optional response header that can be configured on the server to", 
    "instruct the browser to only communicate via HTTPS. This will be", 
    "enforced by the browser even if the user requests a HTTP resource on", 
    "the same server.\n\nCyber-criminals will often attempt to compromise", 
    "sensitive information passed from the client to the server using HTTP.", 
    "This can be conducted via various Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or", 
    "through network packet captures.\n\nThe tool discovered that the affected", 
    "application is using HTTPS however does not use the HSTS header."

      "header be configured on the server.\n\nOne of the options for this", 
      "header is `max-age`, which is a representation (in milliseconds)", 
      "determining the time in which the client's browser will adhere to the", 
      "header policy.\n\nDepending on the environment and the application this", 
      "time period could be from as low as minutes to as long as days."
