    "A NoSQL injection occurs when a value originating from the client's", 
    "request is used within a NoSQL call without prior sanitisation.\n\nThis", 
    "can allow cyber-criminals to execute arbitrary NoSQL code and thus", 
    "steal data, or use the additional functionality of the database server", 
    "to take control of further server components.\n\nThe tool discovered that", 
    "the affected page and parameter are vulnerable. This injection was", 
    "detected as the tool was able to discover known error messages within", 
    "the server's response."
