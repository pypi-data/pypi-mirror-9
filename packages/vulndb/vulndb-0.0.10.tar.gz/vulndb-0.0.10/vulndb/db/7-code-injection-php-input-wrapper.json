    "A modern web application will be reliant on several different", 
    "programming languages.\n\nThese languages can be broken up in two", 
    "flavours. These are client-side languages (such as those that run in", 
    "the browser -- like JavaScript) and server-side languages (which are", 
    "executed by the server -- like ASP, PHP, JSP, etc.) to form the", 
    "dynamic pages (client-side code) that are then sent to the client.", 
    "Because all server-side code should be executed by the server, it", 
    "should only ever come from a trusted source.\n\nCode injection occurs", 
    "when the server takes untrusted code (ie. from the client) and", 
    "executes it.\n\nCyber-criminals will abuse this weakness to execute", 
    "arbitrary code on the server, which could result in complete server", 
    "compromise.\n\nThe tool was able to inject specific server-side code via", 
    "a PHP wrapper (`php://input`) and have the executed output from the", 
    "code contained within the server response. This indicates that proper", 
    "input sanitisation is not occurring."

      "It is recommended that untrusted input is never processed as", 
      "server-side code.\n\nTo validate input, the application should ensure", 
      "that the supplied value contains only the data that are required to", 
      "perform the relevant action.\n\nFor example, where a username is", 
      "required, then no non-alpha characters should not be accepted."
