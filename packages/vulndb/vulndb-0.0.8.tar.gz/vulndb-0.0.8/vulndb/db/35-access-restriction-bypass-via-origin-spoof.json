    "Origin headers are utilised by proxies and/or load balancers to track", 
    "the originating IP address of the client.\n\nAs the request progresses", 
    "through a proxy, the origin header is added to the existing headers,", 
    "and the value of the client's IP is then set within this header.", 
    "Occasionally, poorly implemented access restrictions are based off of", 
    "the originating IP address alone.\n\nFor example, any public IP address", 
    "may be forced to authenticate, while an internal IP address may not.", 
    "Because this header can also be set by the client, it allows", 
    "cyber-criminals to spoof their IP address and potentially gain access", 
    "to restricted pages.\n\nThe tool discovered a resource that it did not", 
    "have permission to access, but been granted access after spoofing the", 
    "address of localhost (127.0.0.1), thus bypassing any requirement to", 
    "authenticate."
