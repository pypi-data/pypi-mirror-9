        TextRank_ implementation for text summarization and keyword extraction in Python
        
        .. _TextRank: http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf
        
        Features
        ---------
        
        * Text summarization
        * Keyword extraction
        * Text modeling with graph and gexf exportation
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Text summarization::
        
            >>> text = "Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text document with a
            computer program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points
            of the original document. As the problem of information overload has grown, and as
            the quantity of data has increased, so has interest in automatic summarization.
            Technologies that can make a coherent summary take into account variables such as
            length, writing style and syntax. An example of the use of summarization technology
            is search engines such as Google. Document summarization is another."
        
            >>> from summa import summarizer
            >>> print summarizer.summarize(text)
            'Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text document with a computer
            program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points of the
            original document.'
        
        
        Keyword extraction::
        
            >>> from summa import keywords
            >>> print keywords.keywords(text)
            document

        Installation
        --------------
        
        This software depends on `NumPy and Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/Download>`_, two Python packages for scientific computing.
        You must have them installed prior to installing `summa`::
        
            pip install summa
        
        
        If you are going to use the export function, you also need `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/download.html>`_.
        For a better performance of keyword extraction, install `Pattern <http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern>`_
        
        This version has been tested under Python 2.7
        
        
        More examples
        -------------
        
        Command-line usage::
        
            cd path/to/folder/summa/
            python textrank.py -t FILE
        
        
        Export::
        
            >>> from summa import export
            >>> export.gexf_export(text, path="graph.gexf")
