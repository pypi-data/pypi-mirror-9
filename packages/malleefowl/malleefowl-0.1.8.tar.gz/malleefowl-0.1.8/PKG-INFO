        Introduction
        ************
        
        Malleefowl (the bird)
           *Malleefowl are shy, wary, solitary birds that usually fly only to escape danger or reach a tree to roost in. Although very active, they are seldom seen [..]* (`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleefowl>`_).
        
        
        Malleefowl is a Python package to simplify the usage of Web Processing Services (WPS). Currently it is using the `PyWPS <https://github.com/geopython/PyWPS>`_ server. It comes with some WPS processes which are used by the ``Phoenix`` WPS web-application. These processes are used to support climate data processing with WPS.
        
        Installation
        ************
        
        Check out code from the malleefowl github repo and start the installation::
         
           $ git clone https://github.com/bird-house/malleefowl.git
           $ cd malleefowl
           $ make
        
        For other install options run ``make help`` and read the documention for the `Makefile <https://github.com/bird-house/birdhousebuilder.bootstrap/blob/master/README.rst>`_.
        
        After successful installation you need to start the
        services. Malleefowl is using `Anaconda <http://www.continuum.io/>`_
        Python distribution system. All installed files (config etc ...) are
        below the Anaconda root folder which is by default in your home
        directory ``~/anaconda``. Now, start the services::
        
           $ make start   # starts supervisor services
           $ make status  # show supervisor status
        
        The depolyed WPS service is available on http://localhost:8091/wps?service=WPS&version=1.0.0&request=GetCapabilities.
        
        Check the log files for errors::
        
           $ tail -f  ~/anaconda/var/log/pywps/malleefowl.log
           $ tail -f  ~/anaconda/var/log/pywps/malleefowl_trace.log
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        If you want to run on a different hostname or port then change the default values in ``custom.cfg``::
        
           $ cd malleefowl
           $ vim custom.cfg
           $ cat custom.cfg
           [settings]
           hostname = localhost
           http-port = 8091
        
        After any change to your ``custom.cfg`` you **need** to run ``make install`` again and restart the ``supervisor`` service::
        
           $ make install
           $ make restart
           $ make status
        
        Running unit tests with testdata
        ================================
        
        To run all unit tests one needs to fetch tests with an esgf openid and start the malleefowl service::
        
            $ bin/wpsfetch -u username
            $ make start
            $ make test
        
        Testdata is collected in ``testdata.json``::
        
            $ vim testdata.json
