        Malleefowl (the bird)
           *Malleefowl are shy, wary, solitary birds that usually fly only to escape danger or reach a tree to roost in. Although very active, they are seldom seen [..]* (`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleefowl>`_).
        
        Malleefowl is a Python package to simplify the usage of Web Processing Services (WPS). Currently it is using the `PyWPS <https://github.com/geopython/PyWPS>`_ server. It provides access to climate data (ESGF, ...) as WPS service and as a Python library.
        For installation and configuration read the `documentation <http://malleefowl.readthedocs.org>`_.
        
        Malleefowl is part of the `Birdhouse <http://bird-house.github.io>`_ project.
