Description: virtualtime
        ===========
        
        Implements a system for simulating a virtual time (based on an offset from the current actual time)
        so that all Python objects believe it though the actual system time remains the same.
        
        This also includes an extension to the python-datetime-tz library (`datetime_tz`) that ensures that the
        classes are all patched in the correct order. It also changes the behaviour of `datetime_tz.datetime_tz` objects
        to allow them to be compared with naive `datetime.datetime` objects by assuming that they are in the local timezone, if unspecified.
