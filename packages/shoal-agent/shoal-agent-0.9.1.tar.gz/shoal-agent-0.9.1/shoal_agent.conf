#
# A sample configuration file to shoal agent.
#

[general]

# interval: the interval at which the shoal-agent will contact the shoal server
# in seconds. The default value is 30 seconds.
interval = 30

# external_ip: This value is used in the case where the squid has a private
# address only. It should be set to the public ip of the NAT gateway used to
# reach the squid server. This information allows the Shoal server to determine a
# rough geographic location for the privately addressed squid for matching
# purposes. The default is blank.  
#
external_ip = 

# squid_port: the port used by the squid server. Defaults to port 3128
#
squid_port = 3128

# interface: The network interface shoal should monitor
#
# Network Interface Card you want to monitor the load on.
# Shoal Agent will try its best to automatically detect the correct NIC,
# but in cases where there are multiple NICs this should be set.
#
# e.g. interface = eth0
#
interface = 

# global_access: The server is accesible from any IP
# domain_access: Set you preference for how the Shaol server shares your squid
#
# These two closely related options allow you to control the behaviors of the
# squid server in relation to the squid advertised by this agent. They are 
# confusing and will be replaced soon.
#
# A Fully accessible squid should set global_access = True and 
# domain_access = True. Shoal will verify your squid and hand it out to any client.
# 
# A squid that is only accessible internally at site should set 
# global_access = False and domain_access = False. Shoal won't attempt to 
# verify the squid, but will still hand out to clients from the same domain.
#
# A squid that you would prefer others not to use however you would like Shoal
# to verify should set global_access = False, and  domain_access = True. 
#
global_access = False
domain_access = True

#this is the max load of the server in terms of KB/s
#
max_load = 122000

[rabbitmq]
# Shoal agent talks to the shoal server using the AMQP protocol. This section
# configures the communication with the AMQP server. In order to get a working
# setup you will likely have to change amqp_server_url below.

# amqp_server_url: RabbitMQ Server IP
#
amqp_server_url = localhost 

# amqp_port: Typically 5671 is used for a SSL connection, or 5672 for an 
# unauthenticated connection.
#
amqp_port = 5672

# amqp_virtual_host: RabbitMQ virtual host. This can typically be safely left
# as the default '/'.
#
amqp_virtual_host = /

# amqp_exchange_name: RabbitMQ exchange name. Default is shoal.
#
amqp_exchange = shoal

[logging]
# Configurations specific to webpy server

# log_file: path to the log file
#
log_file = /var/log/shoal_agent.log

# logging_level: how much information to write to the log file
#
# valid levels DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
