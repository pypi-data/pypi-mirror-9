[general]

# interval: the interval at which the shoal-agent will contact the shoal server
# in seconds. The default value is 30 seconds.
interval = 30

# external_ip: This value is used in the case where the squid has a private
# address only. It should be set to the public ip of the NAT gateway used to
# reach the squid server. This information allows the Shoal server to determine a
# rough geographic location for the privately addressed squid for matching
# purposes. The default is blank.  
external_ip = 

# squid_port: the port used by the squid server. Defaults to port 3128
squid_port = 3128

# Network Interface Card you want to monitor the load on.
# Shoal Agent will try its best to automatically detect the correct NIC,
# but in cases where there are multiple NICs this should be set.

# e.g. interface = eth0

[rabbitmq]

# setup you will likely have to change amqp_server_url below.

# as the default '/'.
