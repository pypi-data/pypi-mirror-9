![Downloads](https://pypip.in/d/trepan/badge.png) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rocky/python2-trepan.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rocky/python2-trepan)

This is a rewrite of the Python debugger, [pydb](http://bashdb.sf.net/pydb), itself a derivative of the stock Python debugger *pdb*.

See this [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/pydbgr/w/list) for
more information.

Works with Python 2.6 and 2.7. It might also work with Python 2.5.
See [this](https://code.google.com/p/python3-trepan/) for the same thing
that works with Python 3. Use *pydb* for Python 2.5 and earlier.
