=================
SlipStream Client
=================

This project contains a command line client for accessing a SlipStream server. 
More information about the SlipStream can be found at: 
http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream.html


Installation
============

This package is intended to be installed via pip.  The following
should 'just work':

    pip install slipstream-client

If this is done system-wide, the PYTHONPATH and PATH should already be
set up correctly.  If this is a local installation, then you may need
to set those environmental variables by hand. 

See the tutorials on the SlipStream website on how to use the client.


Feedback
========

or packaging, please send an email to support@sixsq.com.
