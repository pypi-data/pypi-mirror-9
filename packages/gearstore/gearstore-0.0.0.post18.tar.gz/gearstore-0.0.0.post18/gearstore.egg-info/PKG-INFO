        Inspiration
        -----------
        
        This project is inspired by dormando's Garivini. Since that one is in
        Perl, and we don't like supporting perl, we are reimplementing the same
        interface in python with the gear library.
        
        See https://github.com/dormando/Garivini for more.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Distributed message persistence for Gearman jobs makes persistence scale out.
        * No centralized store makes system more fault tolerant.
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        Gearstore is pip installable. Once it has been installed, you will need
        to initialize the database schema::
        
          gearstore-init-schema mysql://user:pass@host/dbname
        
        You will also need a gearman server available. The library used by
        gearstore, gear, includes one and it will be availalbe in the same
        place as gearstore as  `geard`::
        
          geard
        
        Once the database is initialized, run as many gearstores as is needed
        to keep traffic flowing::
        
          gearstore --sqlalchemy-dsn=mysql://user:pass@host/dbname
