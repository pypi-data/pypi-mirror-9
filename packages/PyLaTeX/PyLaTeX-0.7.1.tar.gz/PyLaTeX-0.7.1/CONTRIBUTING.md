### How to contribute
There are just two things you really need to do:
- Follow the PEP8 style guide and make sure it passes pyflakes.
    (You use flake8 to test these both)
- Run the `testall.sh` script before making a pull request to check if you
    didn't break anything.

If you don't do these two things Travis will catch you anyway.



If you want you can also do these things and they are appreciated:

- If you add something new, show it off with an example.
- If you add new arguments to something, add them to the args test. That way I
    will know when the external API is changed.
- If you fix something, add a test so it won't break again.
- Add your addition, change or fix to the changelog so it will be mentioned in
    the next release.

It would be nice if you would do these things. But to be fair, I don't do it
all the time either.
