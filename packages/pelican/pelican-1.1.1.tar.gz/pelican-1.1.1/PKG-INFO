Description: Pelican
        #######
        
        Pelican is a simple weblog generator, writen in python.
        The goals are quite simple: 
        
        * No more dynamic language online for weblogs, as it's not needed most 
          of the time.
        * Write your weblog entries directly with your editor of choice (vim!) and
          directly in restructured text.
        * A simple cli-tool to (re)generate the weblog.
        * Easy to interface with DVCSes and web hooks
        
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Yeah? You're ready? Let's go !::
        
            $ pip install pelican
            $ pelican -p /path/to/your/content/
            ...
        
        Andâ€¦ that's all! You can see your weblog generated on the content/ folder.
        
        
        Metadata
        ---------
        
        Pelican tries to be smart enough to get the informations he needs from the
        filesystem (for instance, about date of creation of the files), but it seems to
        be less reliable than static metadata.
        
        You could provide the metadata in the restructured text files, using the
        following syntax::
        
            My super title
            ##############
        
            .. date: 2010-10-03 10:20
            .. tags: thats, awesome
            .. category: yeah
            .. author: Alexis Metaireau
        
        Why the name "Pelican" ?
        ------------------------
        
        Heh, you didnt noticed? "Pelican" is an anagram for "Calepin" ;)
        
        Feedback !
        ----------
        
        If you want to see new features in Pelican, dont hesitate to tell me, to clone
        the repository, etc. That's open source, dude!
