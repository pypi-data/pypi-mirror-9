Description: Pelican
        #######
        
        Pelican is a simple weblog generator, writen in python.
        
        * Write your weblog entries directly with your editor of choice (vim!) and
          directly in restructured text, or markdown.
        * A simple cli-tool to (re)generate the weblog.
        * Easy to interface with DVCSes and web hooks
        * Completely static output, so easy to host anywhere !
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Pelican currently supports:
        
        * blog articles
        * comments, via an external service (disqus). Please notice that while
          it's useful, it's an external service, and you'll not manage the
          comments by yourself. It could potentially eat your data.
        * theming support (themes are done using `jinja2 <http://jinjna.pocoo.org>`_)
        * PDF generation of the articles/pages (optional).
        
        Have a look to `the documentation <http://alexis.notmyidea.org/pelican/>`_ for
        more informations.
