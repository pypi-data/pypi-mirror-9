"""
Modes manage the state and transition between different application modes.
Typically such modes are presented as different screens that the user can
navigate between, similar to the way a browser navigates web pages. Individual
modes may be things like:

- Title screen
- Options dialog
- About screen
- In-progress game
- Inventory interface

The modal framework provides a simple mechanism to ensure that modes are
activated and deactivated properly. An activated mode is running and receives
events. A deactivated mode is paused and does not receive events.

Modes may be managed as a *last-in-first-out* stack, or as a list, or ring
of modes in sequence, or some combination of all.

For example usage see: :ref:`the mode section of the tutorial <tut-mode-section>`.
