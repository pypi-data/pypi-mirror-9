"""Worlds are environments described by a configuration of components, systems and 
renderers. These parts describe the data, behavioral and presentation aspects
of the world respectively.

The world environment is the context within which entities exist. A typical
application consists of one or more worlds containing entities that evolve
over time and react to internal and external interaction.

See :ref:`an example of world configuration in the tutorial <tut-world-example>`.
