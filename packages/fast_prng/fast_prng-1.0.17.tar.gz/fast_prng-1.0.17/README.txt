This module is an extension of a faster Pseudo Random Number Generator
originally designed in c. It mimics the functions: random.exponential and 
random.normal found in numpy, while offering considerable speedup. Please see 
https://bitbucket.org/cdmcfarland/fast_prng for details on the original 
project.
