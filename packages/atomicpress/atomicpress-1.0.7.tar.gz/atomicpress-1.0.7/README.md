## Extensions

### Toggle extensions

AtomicPress uses a pluggale extension system, similar to django's INSTALLED_APPS.
To disable a plugin, define a property in your settings file and just define the ones you need.

	EXTENSIONS = (
	    # "atomicpress.ext.importer",
	    "atomicpress.ext.exporter",
	    "atomicpress.ext.ftp",
	    "atomicpress.ext.s3",
	    "atomicpress.ext.prefill",
	)
	
Activating you own is also simple, like this extension called catpictures:

	EXTENSIONS = (
	    "atomicpress.ext.importer",
	    "atomicpress.ext.exporter",
	    "atomicpress.ext.ftp",
	    "atomicpress.ext.s3",
	    "atomicpress.ext.prefill",
	    "catpictures",
	)
	
### Create extension

To create a extension, create a module with a function called setup. Thats all you need.
