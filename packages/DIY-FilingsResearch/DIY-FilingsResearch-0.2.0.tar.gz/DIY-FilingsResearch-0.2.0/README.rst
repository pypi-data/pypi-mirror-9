For installation directions see the `wiki <https://github.com/greedo/DIY-FilingsResearch/wiki/PyLucene-installation-guide>`__.

Initialization
--------------

To start using the library, first import ``Ingestor`` and ``Edgar``

::

    from ingestor import Ingestor, Edgar

``Edgar`` (US) and ``Sedar`` (Canada) are currently supported. Note however that the flows are a bit different.
See the note at the bottom about the ``Sedar`` flow.

Simple Download Workflow
-----------------------

First specific what kind of files using the new ``Edgar`` basic object

::

    ingestor = Ingestor()
    edgar = Edgar("xbrl")

``xbrl`` or ``html`` are currently supported

Then pass ``ingest_stock()`` with a stock ticker to ingest and a directory to store the downloaded docs into 
``file_downloader()``

::

    ingestor.file_downloader(edgar.ingest_stock("AAPL"), downloaded_docs_directory)
    
See the `wiki <https://github.com/greedo/DIY-FilingsResearch/wiki/Using-the-document-ingestor#sedar-download-workflow-note>`__
for a special note on ``Sedar`` parsing.
