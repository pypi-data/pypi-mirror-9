Description: ## Python Package for Forio Epicenter
        
        Forio's Epicenter Python Package ("epicenter.py") is used by the Forio
        Epicenter platform (http://www.forio.com/epicenter) to interact with
        Python models. The package contains functions for queueing variables to
        record them with the Epicenter Data API and for setting variables to
        values using the variable PATCH API. This package is not intended to
        provide any functionality outside of the Epicenter environment. It is
        provided only for local development of models that are planned to be
        uploaded to the Epicenter platform.
        
        Questions about the package can be answered by looking at the
        documentation (https://forio.com/epicenter/docs/public/) or by
        emailing support@forio.com.
