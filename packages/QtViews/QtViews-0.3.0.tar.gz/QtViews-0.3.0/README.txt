Introduction
------------

QtViews is a helper library for creating super cool tabbed and docked
combination workspaces for Qt (that is, PySide/PyQt4) applications.

The premier component is the TabbedWorkspaceMixin which is a mix-in for classes
derived from QtGui.QMainWindow.

The second component is a calendar view.
