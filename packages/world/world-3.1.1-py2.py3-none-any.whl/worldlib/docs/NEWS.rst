================
 * Convert repository to git and modernize the code.
 * Remove the use of `distribute`.
 * Python 2.7 and 3.4 is supported.
 * ISO has pulled the free XML version of the two letter country codes.  Thus
   ``--refresh`` now prints a minor rant and is effectively deprecated.

   version.

================
 * Initial standalone release.
