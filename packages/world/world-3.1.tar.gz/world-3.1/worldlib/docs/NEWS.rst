3.1 (2015-01-08)
================
 * Convert repository to git and modernize the code.
 * Remove the use of `distribute`.
 * Python 2.7 and 3.4 is supported.
 * ISO has pulled the free XML version of the two letter country codes.  Thus
   ``--refresh`` now prints a minor rant and is effectively deprecated.
   ``--source`` and ``--cache`` are no-ops and will be removed in a future
   version.

3.0 (2013-07-01)
================
 * Initial standalone release.
