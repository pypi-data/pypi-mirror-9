Description: =============================================
        Flying Circus QEMU virtual machine management
        =============================================
        
        This package provides a utility to manage virtual machines and their life cycle
        in the Flying Circus. We try to keep specifics of our environment out of there,
        but we make a few assumptions:
        
        * VM disks (root, swap, tmp) are stored in Ceph
        * There is a script `create-vm` that will prepare a fresh root disk image.
        
        The utility allows you to
        
        * start, stop and migrate VMs between hosts
        * run a daemon that enforces the policy about running VMs
          given by a set of config files
        * resize disks.
        
        
        Config format
        =============
        
        Generic template
        ----------------
        
        The Qemu config file will be generated from a template. If no template is found
        in `/etc/qemu/qemu.vm.cfg.in`, a built-in default template will be used. Refer
        to qemu.vm.cfg.in in the source distribution.
        
        
        Per-VM configuration
        --------------------
        
        Expects a config file for each VM in `/etc/qemu/vm/*.cfg`.
        
        The config file format is YAML.
        
        Format::
        
            name: test00
            parameters:
                id: 12345
                resource_group: test
        
                online: true
                kvm_host: bob
        
                disk: 5
                memory: 512
                cores: 1
        
                nics:
                - srv: 00-01-02-03-05-06
                - fe: 00-01-02-03-05-06

        Release notes
        =============
        
        
        0.6.2 (2015-01-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Relax PyYaml and psutil version requirements to accommodate to the Flying
          Circus managed platform.
        
        
        0.6.1 (2015-01-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Improve logging and error messages (#13867).
        - Fix unwanted behaviour during error conditions (#13867).
        
        
        0.6 (2015-01-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Implement live migration. Use "inmigrate" and "outmigrate" commands
          to coordinate the process (#13229).
        - Note that the qemu.cfg.in template has changed!
        - Improve test coverage.
        
        
        0.5.1 (2014-11-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix: remove Ceph discard call since it seems to be unstable (#13414).
        - Improve operability by reworking what is logged to fc-qemu.log.
        
        
        0.5 (2014-11-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Root filesystem shrink during VM start (#13414).
        - Add 'force-unlock' action to break stale locks (e.g., after a VM host went
          down).
        
        
        0.4.3 (2014-11-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Read Qemu config file template from `/etc/qemu/qemu.vm.cfg.in`.
        - Fix tests and documentation.
        
        
        0.4.2 (2014-11-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Rate limit entropy transfer from host to guest (#13751).
        - Add 'restart' command to simplify VM restarts.
        
        
        0.4.1 (2014-09-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Do not require the PID to match the machine name for determining
          online status. This caused issues for VMs with names longer than 11
          characters: http://status.flyingcircus.io/incidents/3j8wsrszlx2w
        
        
        0.4 (2014-09-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Allow selecting the specific command line to call for creating a VM
          using a config file + formatting syntax.
        
        - Add test coverage to show that we gracefully recover from crashed VMs
          upon a subsequent 'ensure'.
        
        0.3 (2014-09-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Refactor and rename to 'fc.qemu'.
          Integrate most functionality that was previously placed in our
          init scripts and localconfig (fc.agent) utilities.
        
        - Add a lot of test coverage.
        
        
        0.2.6 (2014-08-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix incoming VM detection for an already locked _and_ started VM.
        
        
        0.2.5 (2014-08-20)
        ------------------
        
        * Implement a safety-belt to prohibit migrating VMs that have not
          yet been started with the supported /run/kvm.*.cfg.in format.
        
        
        fc.qemu development
        ===================
        
        Prepare working copy in a personal box::
        
            host$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/flyingcirucs/fc.qemu
            host$ cd fc.qemu
            host$ vagrant up
            host$ vagrant ssh
        
        Run the tests::
        
            vm$ cd /vagrant
            vm$ sudo bin/py.test
        
        Test execution automatically updates a coverage report in the `htmlcov`
        directory.
