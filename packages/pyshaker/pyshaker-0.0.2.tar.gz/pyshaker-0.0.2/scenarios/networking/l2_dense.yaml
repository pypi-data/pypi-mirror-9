description:
  This scenario launches several pairs of VMs on pair of compute nodes.
  VM are plugged into the same private network. Useful for testing performance
  degradation when the number of VMs grows.

deployment:
  template: l2.hot
  vm_accommodation: [pair, single_room, density: 4, compute_nodes: 2]

execution:
  size: 'quadratic_progression'
