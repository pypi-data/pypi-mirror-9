The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `planemo` for local development.

1. Fork the `planemo` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/planemo.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv planemo
    $ cd planemo/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass ``flake8``
and the tests::

    $ flake8 planemo tests
    $ python setup.py test

To get ``flake8``, just ``pip install`` them into your virtualenv.

.. including testing other Python versions with tox
..    $ python setup.py test
..    $ tox
..
..   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring.
2. The pull request should work for Python 2.6 and 2.7. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/galaxyproject/planemo/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

.. Tips
.. ----
.. To run a subset of tests::
..    $ python -m unittest tests.test_planemo
