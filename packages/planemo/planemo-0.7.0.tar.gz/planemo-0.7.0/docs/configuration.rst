Configuration
=============

See the ``--help`` or the documentation_ for a detailed list of individual
options for each command. Certain options that make sense for multiple
commands or tools suites can be declared instead globally by placing them
in a ``.planemo.yml`` file in your home directory.

Below is an annotated outline of some of the options that can be set in this
file.

.. literalinclude:: .planemo.yml
   :language: xml
