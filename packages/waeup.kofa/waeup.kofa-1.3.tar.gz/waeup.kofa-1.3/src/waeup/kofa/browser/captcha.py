    This is the Kofa implementation to support captchas as provided by
    http://www.google.com/recaptcha.

    ReCaptcha is widely used and adopted in web applications. See the
    above web page to learn more about recaptcha.

    Basically, it generates a captcha box in a page loaded by a
    client. The client can then enter a solution for a challenge
    picture (or audio file) and send the solution back to our server
    along with the challenge string generated locally on the client.

    This component then verifies the entered solution deploying the
    private key set by asking a verification server. The result (valid
    or invalid solution) is then returned to any calling component.

    As any captcha-component, :class:`ReCaptcha` can be used by any
    other component that wants to display/verify captchas.

    To incorporate captcha usage in a view, page, or viewlet, the
    following steps have to be performed:

    * get the currently site-wide selected captcha type by doing::

        mycaptcha = getUtility(ICaptchaManager).getCaptcha()

    * if you want a specific captcha type (like ReCaptcha)::

        mycaptcha = getUtility(ICaptcha, name='ReCaptcha')

    Now, as you have a captcha, you can verify sent data by doing::

        result = mycaptcha.verify(self.request)

    where ``self.request`` should be the sent HTTP request and
    ``result`` will be an instance of class:``CaptchaResponse``. The
    response will contain an error code (``result.error_code``) that
    might be ``None`` but can (and should) be passed to the
    :meth:``display`` method to display error messages in the captcha
    box. The error code is most probably not a human readable string
    but some code you shouldn't rely upon.

    All this could be done in the ``update()`` method of a view, page,
    or viewlet.

    To render the needed HTML code, you can deploy the
    :meth:`display`` method of ``mycaptcha``.

    This captcha is available at runtime as a global utility named
    ``'ReCaptcha'``.
