    and functions in this module) and then interacts with this
    JobContainer.

    finding the databases' roots. It is sufficient to pass any
    persisted object (or more precisely: some object with a valid
    ``_p_jar__`` attribte). As long as some site was already set (for
    instance during regular requests), the site is looked up
