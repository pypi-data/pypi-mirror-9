Email (SMTP) services for Kofa.

Note About Encodings
--------------------

All functions in this module expect any raw strings passed in to be
encoded 'utf-8' (if you pass in unicode objects instead, this is not a
problem).

This is because we cannot easily tell from a raw string (it is in fact
only a byte stream) what encoding it has. In latin-1 and utf-8, for
instance, there exist some chars (byte values) that have different
meanings in both encodings. If we see such a char in a byte stream:
what is it meant to represent? The respective character from latin1 or
the one from utf-8?

We therefore interpret all internally used raw strings to be encoded as
utf-8.

The functions in here nevertheless try hard to produce output (mail
parts, headers, etc.) encoded in the least complex manner. For
instance if you pass in some address or mail body that is
representable (correctly) as ASCII or latin-1, we will turn the text
into that encoding (given, you passed it in as utf-8) to stay as
compatible as possible with old mailers that do not understand utf-8.
