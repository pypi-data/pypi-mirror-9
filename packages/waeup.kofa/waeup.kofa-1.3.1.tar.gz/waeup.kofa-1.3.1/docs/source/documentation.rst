About these documents
*********************

These documents are generated from `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ sources by `Sphinx`_, an excellent
document processor specifically written for the Python documentation
by Georg Brandl and contributors.

Development of this documentation is organized by Uli Fouquet (``uli
at waeup dot org``) and Henrik Bettermann (``henrik at waeup dot
org``). We're always looking for volunteers wanting to help with the
docs, so feel free to send a mail there!

Many thanks go to:

* the `docutils <http://docutils.sf.net/>`_ project for creating
  reStructuredText and the docutils suite;
* Georg Brandl for his `sphinx` package.

See :ref:`building_documentation` to learn how to create HTML or PDF

See :ref:`reporting-bugs` for information how to report bugs in
`waeup.kofa` itself.
