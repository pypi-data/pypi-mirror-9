        * Redirect to login page after using password mandate.
        
        * Adding student payment tickets is logged.
        
        * Provide XMLRPC services for storing and retrieving fingerprint
          scans.
        
        * Sort ContextualDictSource by dictionary values not by keys.

        * Special application procedure modified. Special applicants must submit
          their form before they can download payment slips. Thus the regular
          workflow is now applied but, in contrast to regular applications,
          special applicants can create and pay more than one payment ticket.
          Also application slips are hidden.
        
        * Add setMatricNumber and constructMatricNumber methods to StudentsUtils.
        
        * When sending mails, always set from-address to 'no-reply@waeup.org'.
          Real from-addresses are now set in Cc and Reply-To fields. This is
          to tackle problems with yahoo (does not allow yahoo.com mails to be
          sent from non-yahoo servers).

        * Added JS helper to scroll to sequencelists after adding/removing items.
        
        
        1.1 (2014-03-13)
        ================
        
        * Add display_fullname column to CourseTicketExporter (requested by Uniben).
        
        * Do also export student and course ticket data of students on probation.
        
        * 'Create student' option removed from 'Application Transition'
          select field.
        
        * API docs added.

        * Use absolute urls on datacenter pages.

        * After login and logout, regular users (officers) are redirected
          to the portal's index page not to the portal's root. The
          root URL can now be rewritten be Nginx or Apache so that the user
          is being redirected to the university website
          when entering the root URL directly or clicking the acronym.
        
        * Show tooltip alert and warning window before updating plugins.
        
        * JSAction has been deprecated. KofaAction can be used instead. Additional
          parameters can be used in @action decorators to enable tooltips and/or
          warning windows. The old @jsaction decorator still triggers a default
          warning message.
        
        * jquery-ui.min.js is also used for tooltips.
        
        * Do not create TSC AC batch when updating plugins.
          All TSC batches are created.
        
        * Make table on applicantsrootpage responsive.
        
        * Change width of input, select and textarea fields.
        
        * Use only https in theme.html.
        
        * INSTALL.txt updated and integrated into Sphinx documentation.
        
        * Redundancies removed in docs.
