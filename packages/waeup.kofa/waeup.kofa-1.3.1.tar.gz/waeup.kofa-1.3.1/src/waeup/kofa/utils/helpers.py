class FactoryBase(grok.GlobalUtility):
    """A factory for things.

    This is a baseclass for easier creation of factories. Factories
    are utilities that are registered under a certain name and return
    instances of certain classes when called.

    In :mod:`waeup.kofa` we use factories extensively for
    batching. While processing a batch some processors looks up a
    factory to create real-world instances that then get filled with
    data from imported CSV files.

    To get rid of reimplementing the same stuff over and over again,
    most notably the methods defined here, we offer this base class
    (which will *not* be registered as a factory itself).

    Real factories can then be created like this:

       >>> import grok
       >>> from waeup.kofa.utils.helpers import FactoryBase
       >>> class MyObject(object):
       ...   # Some class we want to get instances of.
       ...   pass
       >>> class MyObjectFactory(FactoryBase):
       ...   # This is the factory for MyObject instances
       ...   grok.name(u'waeup.kofa.factory.MyObject')
       ...   factory = MyObject

    That's it. It is essential to set the ``factory`` attribute, which
    will determine the class of which instances should be created when
    called. The given name must even be unique amongst all utilities
    registered during runtime. While you can pick any name you like
    you might want to prepend ``waeup.kofa.factory.`` to the name
    string to make sure it does not clash with names of other
    utilities one day.

    Before all this works we have to grok the baseclass once and our
    freshly defined factory. This executes all the component
    registration stuff we don't want to do ourselves. In daily use
    this is done automatically on startup of a :mod:`waeup.kofa`
    system.

       >>> grok.testing.grok('waeup.kofa.utils.helpers')
       >>> grok.testing.grok_component(
       ...    'MyObjectFactory', MyObjectFactory
       ...  )
       True

    After grokking we (and processors) can create objects without
    knowing about the location of the real class definition, just by
    the factory name:

       >>> from zope.component import createObject
       >>> obj = createObject('waeup.kofa.factory.MyObject')
       >>> isinstance(obj, MyObject)
       True

    We can also use the regular utility lookups to find our new
    factory:

       >>> from zope.component import getUtility
       >>> from zope.component.interfaces import IFactory
       >>> factory = getUtility(
       ...   IFactory, name='waeup.kofa.factory.MyObject'
       ...   )
       >>> isinstance(factory, MyObjectFactory)
       True

    And this factory generates `MyObject` instances:

       >>> obj = factory()
       >>> isinstance(obj, MyObject)
       True

    """
