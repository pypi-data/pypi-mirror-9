Convenience stuff for logging.

Main component of :mod:`waeup.kofa.utils.logging` is a mix-in class
:class:`waeup.kofa.utils.logging.Logger`. Classes derived (also) from
that mix-in provide a `logger` attribute that returns a regular Python
logger logging to a rotating log file stored in the datacenter storage
path.

Deriving components (classes) should set their own `logger_name` and
`logger_filename` attribute.

The `logger_name` tells under which name the logger should be
registered Python-wise. This is usually a dotted name string like
``waeup.kofa.${sitename}.mycomponent`` which should be unique. If you
pick a name already used by another component, trouble is ahead. The
``${sitename}`` chunk of the name can be set literally like this. The
logger machinery will turn it into some real site name at time of
logging.

The `logger_filename` attribute tells how the logfile should be
named. This should be some base filename like
``mycomponent.log``. Please note, that some logfile names are already
used: ``main.log``, ``applications.log``, and ``datacenter.log``.

The `Logger` mix-in also cares for updating the logging handlers when
a datacenter location moves. That means you do not have to write your
own event handlers for the purpose. Just derive from `Logger`, set
your `logger_name` and `logger_filename` attribute and off you go::

  from waeup.kofa.utils.logger import Logger

  class MyComponent(object, Logger):
      # Yes that's a complete working class
      logger_name = 'waeup.kofa.${sitename}.mycomponent
      logger_filename = 'mycomponent.log'

      def do_something(self):
           # demomstrate how to use logging from methods
           self.logger.info('About to do something')
           try:
               # Do something here
           except IOError:
               self.logger.warn('Something went wrong')
               return
           self.logger.info('I did it')

As you can see from that example, methods of the class can log
messages simply by calling `self.logger`.

The datacenter and its storage are created automatically when you
create a :class:`waeup.kofa.app.University`. This also means that
logging with the `Logger` mix-in will work only inside so-called sites
(`University` instances put into ZODB are such `sites`).

Other components in this module help to make everything work.
