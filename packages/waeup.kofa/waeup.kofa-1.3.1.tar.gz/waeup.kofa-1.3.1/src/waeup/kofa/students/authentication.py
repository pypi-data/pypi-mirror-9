    changing his/her own password.

    When users change their own password they might find themselves
    logged out on next request.

    To avoid this, we support to use a 'change password' page a bit
    like a regular login page. That means, on each request we lookup
    the sent data for a login field called 'student_id' and a
    password.

    If both exist, this means someone sent new credentials.

    We then look for the old credentials stored in the user session.
    If the new credentials' login (the student_id) matches the old
    one's, we set the new credentials in session _but_ we return the
    old credentials for the authentication plugins to check as for the
    current request (and for the last time) the old credentials apply.

    No valid credentials are returned by this plugin if one of the
    follwing circumstances is true

    - the sent request is not a regular IHTTPRequest

    - the credentials to set do not match the old ones

    - no credentials are sent with the request

    - no credentials were set before (i.e. the user has no session
      with credentials set before)

    - no session exists already

    - password and repeated password do not match

    Therefore it is mandatory to put this plugin in the line of all
    credentials plugins _before_ other plugins, so that the regular
    credentials plugins can drop in as a 'fallback'.

    This plugin was designed for students to change their passwords,
    but might be used to allow password resets for other types of
    accounts as well.
