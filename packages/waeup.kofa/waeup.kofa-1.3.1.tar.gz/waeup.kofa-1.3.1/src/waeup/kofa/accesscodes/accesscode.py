"""Components to handle access codes.

Access codes (aka PINs) in waeup sites are organized in batches. That
means a certain accesscode must be part of a batch. As a site (or
university) can hold an arbitrary number of batches, we also provide a
batch container. Each university has one batch container that holds
all access code batches of which each one can hold several thousands
of access codes.

    Implements
    :class:`waeup.kofa.accesscodes.interfaces.IAccessCode`. :class:`AccessCode`
    instances are normally part of an :class:`AccessCodeBatch` so
    their representation (or code) is built with the containing batch
    involved.

    `batch_serial`
       the serial number of the new :class:`AccessCode` inside its batch.

    `random_num`
       a 10-digit number representing the main part of the code.

    :class:`AccessCode` instances normally have a representation (or
    code) like

      ``APP-XXX-YYYYYYYYYY``

    where ``APP`` is the prefix of the containing batch, ``XXX`` is
    the batch number and ``YYYYYYYYYY`` is the real code. The complete
    PIN is portal-wide unique.

    Access code instances are far more than simple strings. They have
    a state, a history (so that all changes can be tracked) and a
    cost (given as a float number).

    The state of an access code is something like 'used', 'disabled',
    etc. and determined by the workflow defined in
    :mod:`waeup.kofa.accesscodes.workflow`. This also means that
    instead of setting the status of an access code directly (you
    can't do that easily, and yes, that's intentionally), you have to
    trigger a transition (that might fail, if the transition is not
    allowed in terms of logic or permissions). See
    :mod:`waeup.kofa.accesscodes.workflow` for details.

    """Fire workflow transition for access code.

    The access code instance is looked up via `access_code` (a string
    like ``APP-1-12345678``).

    `arg` tells what kind of transition to trigger. This will be a
    transition id like ``'use'`` or ``'init'``, or some transition
    target like :data:`waeup.kofa.accesscodes.workflow.INITIALIZED`.

    If `toward` is ``False`` (the default) you have to pass a
    transition id as `arg`, otherwise you must give a transition
    target.

    If `comment` is specified (default is ``None``) the given string
    will be passed along as transition comment. It will appear in the
    history of the changed access code. You can use this to place
    remarks like for which object the access code was used or similar.

    If `owner` is specified, the owner attribute of the access code is checked.
    If the owner is different :func:`fire_transition` fails and returns False.

    :func:`fire_transition` might raise exceptions depending on the
    reason why the requested transition cannot be performed.

    The following exceptions can occur during processing:

    :exc:`KeyError`:
      signals not existent access code, batch or site.

    :exc:`ValueError`:
      signals illegal format of `access_code` string. The regular format is
      ``APP-N-XXXXXXXX``.

    :exc:`hurry.workflow.interfaces.InvalidTransitionError`:
      the transition requested cannot be performed because the workflow
      rules forbid it.

    :exc:`Unauthorized`:
      the current user is not allowed to perform the requested transition.
