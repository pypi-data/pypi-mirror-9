Description: ==========================
        XSTOOLs
        ==========================
        
        XSTOOLs is a collection of Python classes for interfacing to
        XESS FPGA boards through a USB connection.
        
        Look in the ``bin`` to see several examples of command-line
        utilities that use these classes to perform operations on
        XESS boards.
        
        Install steps for Ubuntu/Debian
        ===================================
        #. ``sudo apt-get install python-pip``
        #. ``sudo pip install xstools --allow-all-external --allow-unverified intelhex``
        
        Install steps for Windows
        ==========================
        #. Install some version of python (e.g., www.activestate.com).
        #. ``easy_install xstools``, or ...
        #. ``pip install xstools --allow-all-external --allow-unverified intelhex``

        * Dave Vandenbout wrote the original C++ version of XSTOOLs
          and the majority of the Python version.
        
        * John Bowman wrote a Python version of xsload. Hector Peraza 
          modified the python code to eliminate some problems and make 
          FPGA configuration via JTAG conform to accepted practice.
          Dave took ideas and bits from Hector's code and integrated them 
          into this package.
          
        * Al Neissner wrote a Python version of xsusbprg and bits of
          his code are used in this package.
          
        * Alireza Moini added the methods for reading voltages
          from the XuLA board analog I/O pins. Dave modified these
          to output floating-point values.
