Estonian ID-card "ecosystem" helper library and command line utility.

The esteid utility helps to:
 * query ldap.sk.ee in a meaningful way
 * convert ID codes to SSH keys
 * verify certificates against OCSP

Access to the Mobile-ID DigiDocService is currently excluded from
the source.

This depends on M2Crypto either being available or being able to
build it, ditto for python-ldap.

On Debian and derivatives:
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev swig \
libsasl2-dev libldap-dev python-dev
