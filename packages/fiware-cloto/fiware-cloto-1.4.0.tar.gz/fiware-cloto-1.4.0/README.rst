- MySQL 5.6.14 or above (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

Once you have all prerequisites installed, you must create a DB named cloto in your MySQL server.
Ensure your mysql path is in your path. If not, you can add executing (change /usr/local/ with your mysql folder):
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin

In addition, be sure you have installed mysql-devel package for development of MySQL applications.
You should be able to install it from yum or apt-get package managers.
    examples: yum install mysql-devel
              apt-get install mysql-devel
              ...etc

After all  you must run install.sh with sudo privileges in order to start installation.
This script should install fiware-cloto in /opt/policyManager and it will ask you for some configuration
parameters, please, ensure you have all this data before starting the script in order to install fiware-cloto
easiest.
    - Keystone URL.
    - Keystone admin user, password and tenant.
    - Mysql user and password.

After finishing you must configure cloto configuration and some apache settings.


Configuration - Cloto
=====================
Before starting the rule engine, you should edit settings.py located at cloto folder or in /etc/sysconfig/fiware-cloto.cfg.
Constants you need to complete are:

- All in # OPENSTACK CONFIGURATION: Openstack information (If you provide this information in the install
   script you do not need to edit)
- RABBITMQ_URL: URL Where RabbitMQ is listening (no port needed, it uses default port)
- CONTEXT_BROKER_URL: URL where Context Broker is listening
- NOTIFICATION_URL: URL where notification service is listening (This service must be implemented by the user)

in addition you could modify other constants like NOTIFICATION_TIME, or DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE.

Finally you should modify ALLOWED_HOSTS parameter in settings.py adding the hosts you want to be accesible from outside,
your IP address, the domain name, etc. An example could be like this:

   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['policymanager.host.com','80.71.123.2’]


Configuration - Apache + wsgi
=============================
Edit your httpd.conf file and add:

    WSGIScriptAlias / PATH_TO_fiware-cloto/cloto/wsgi.py
    WSGIPythonPath PATH_TO_fiware-cloto

    <Directory PATH_TO_fiware-cloto/cloto>
        <Files wsgi.py>
            Order deny,allow
            Allow from all
        </Files>
    </Directory>
    <Directory PATH_TO_fiware-cloto>
        <Files cloto.db>
            Allow from all
        </Files>
    </Directory>
    <Directory /var/log/fiware-cloto>
        <Files RuleEngine.log>
            Allow from all
        </Files>
    </Directory>

Note that PATH_TO_fiware-cloto should be: /opt/policyManager/fiware-cloto

Finally you sould add cloto port to this httpd.conf file

    Listen 8000

We recommend you to disable HTTP TRACK|TRACE methods adding to httpd.conf TraceEnable directive
and set the value to Off

    TraceEnable Off
