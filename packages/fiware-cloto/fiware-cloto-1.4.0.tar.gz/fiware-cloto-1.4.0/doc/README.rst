FIWARE Policy Manager - Overview
____________________________


What you get
============

The Policy Manager GE provides the basic management of cloud resources
based on rules, as well as management of the corresponding resources
within the FI-WARE Cloud Instance like actions based on physical
monitoring or infrastructure, security monitoring of resources and
services or whatever that could be defined by a facts, actions and
rules.

The baseline for the Policy Manager GE is
`PyCLIPS <http://pyclips.sourceforge.net/web/>`__, which is a module to
interface CLIPS expert system and python language. The reason to take
PyCLIPS is to extend the OpenStack ecosystem with a expert system
written in the same language that the rest of the OpenStack services.
Hence, Policy Manager offers the decision-making ability, independently
of the type of resource (physical/virtual resources, network, service or
whatever), able to solve complex problems within the Cloud field by
reasoning about the knowledge base, represented by facts and rules.
