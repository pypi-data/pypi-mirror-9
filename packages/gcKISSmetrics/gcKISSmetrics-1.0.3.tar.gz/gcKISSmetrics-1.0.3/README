== Reasons for the fork
This project is a Fork of KISSMetrics api library.  This fork evolved because the python client works better when it has a setup.py file and can be installed by any standard python package installer, such as easy_install or pip.

== About KISSMetrics
KISSmetrics is different from other analytics platforms due to a combination of
three key features. We focus on funnels and conversions and make them easy to
track and interpret, use people as the basic unit of measure, and support
tracking of highly-flexible custom data through our simple API.
