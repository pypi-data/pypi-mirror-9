        |DOI|
        
        **GENMOD** is a simple to use command line tool for annotating and
        analyzing genomic variations in the
        `VCF <http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.1.pdf>`__ file format.
        It can annotate genetic patterns of inheritance in vcf:s with single or
        multiple families of arbitrary size.
        
        The tools in the genmod suite are:
        
        -  **genmod annotate**, for annotating inheritance patterns,
           frequencies, cadd scores etc.
        -  **genmod build\_annotation**, for building new annotation sets from
           different sources
        -  **genmod analyze**, do a basic analysis of the annotated variants in
           a vcf file
        -  **genmod summarize**, to get some basic statistics of the annotated
           variants in a vcf file
        
        Installation:
        -------------
        
        **GENMOD** works with Python 2.7 and Python v3.2 and above
        
        ::
        
            pip install genmod
        
        or
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/moonso/genmod.git
            cd genmod
            python setup.py install
        
        USAGE:
        ------
        
        genmod annotate
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            genmod annotate variant_file.vcf --family_file ped_file
        
        This will print a new vcf to standard out with all variants annotated
        according to the statements below. All individuals described in the
        `ped <http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml#ped>`__ file
        must be present in the vcf file
        
        See examples in the folder ``genmod/examples``.
        
        **From version 1.9 genmod can split multiallelic calls in vcf:s, use
        flag -split/--split\_variants.**
        
        To get an example of how splitting variants work, run genmod on the file
        ``examples/multi_allele_example.vcf`` with the dominant trio. That is:
        ``genmod annotate examples/multi_allele_example.vcf -f examples/dominant_trio.ped -split``
        
        Compare the result when not using the ``-split`` flag.
        
        Genmod is distributed with a annotation database that is built from the
        refGene data. If the user wants to build a new annotation set use the
        command below:
        
        ::
        
            genmod build_annotation [--type] annotation_file
        
        Each variant in the VCF-file will be annotated with which genetic models
        that are followed in the family if a family file (ped file) is provided.
        
        The genetic models that are checked are the following:
        
        -  Autsomal Recessive, denoted 'AR\_hom'
        -  Autsomal Recessive denovo, denoted 'AR\_hom\_dn'
        -  Autsomal Dominant, 'AD'
        -  Autsomal Dominant denovo, 'AD\_dn'
        -  Autosomal Compound Heterozygote, 'AR\_comp'
        -  X-linked dominant, 'XD'
        -  X-linked dominant de novo, 'XD\_dn'
        -  X-linked Recessive, 'XR'
        -  X-linked Recessive de novo, 'XR\_dn'
        
        Se description of how genetic models are annotated in the section
        **Conditions for genetic models** below.
        
        It is possible to run without a family file, in this case all variants
        will be annotated with which region(s) they belong to, and if other
        annotation files are provided(1000G, CADD scores etc.) the variants will
        get the proper values from these.
        
        `Variant Effect
        Predictor <http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html>`__\ (vep)
        annotations are supported, use the ``--vep``-flag if variants are
        already annotated with vep.
        
        **GENMOD** will add entrys to the INFO column for the given VCF file
        depending on what information is given.
        
        If ``--vep`` is NOT provided:
        
        -  **Annotation** Comma separated list with features overlapped in the
           annotation file
        
        If ``--vep`` is used **Annotation** will not be annotated since all
        information is in the vep entry.
        
        If a pedigree file is provided the following will be added:
        
        -  **GeneticModels** A comma separated list with which genetic models
           that are followed in each family described in the ped file.
           Annotation are separated with pipes on the form
           ``GeneticModels=fam_id_1:AR_hom, fam_id_2:AR_comp|AD_dn`` etc..
        -  **Compounds** Comma separated list with compound pairs(if any) for
           each family. These are described like 'CHR\_POS\_REF\_ALT'
        -  **ModelScore** Model Score, a phred-score based on the genotype
           qualities to describe the uncertainty of the genetic model in each
           family
        
        Also a line for logging is added in the vcf header with the id
        **genmod**, here the date of run, version and command line arguments are
        printed.
        
        -  Compound heterozygote inheritance pattern will be checked if two
           variants are exonic (or in canonical splice sites) and if they reside
           in the same gene.
        
        -  If compounds should be checked in the whole gene (including introns)
           use ``--whole_gene``
        -  GENMOD supports phased data, use the ``-phased`` flag. Data should
           follow the `GATK
           way <http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/discussion/45/read-backed-phasing>`__
           of phasing.
        
        All annotations will be present only if they have a value.
        
        -  **GENMOD** can annotate the variants with 1000 genome frequencies.
           Use the flag
           ``-kg/--thousand_g path/to/bgzipped/thousand_genomes.vcf.gz``
        -  **GENMOD** also supports annotation of frequencies from the
           `ExAC <http://exac.broadinstitute.org/>`__. Use the flag
           ``--exac path/to/bgzipped/ExAC_file.vcf.gz``
        -  Annotate with `CADD scores <http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/>`__, use
           ``-cadd/--cadd_file path/to/huge_cadd_file.tsv.gz``.
        -  There several cadd files with different variant sets to cover as much
           as possible.
        
           -  One with all 1000 genomes positions (this one include some
              indels), if annotation with this one use
              ``-c1kg/--cadd_1000_g path/to/CADD_1000g.txt.gz``.
           -  One with all variants from the ESP6500 dataset. If annotation with
              this one use ``--cadd_esp path/to/CADD_ESP.tsv.gz``.
           -  One with all variants from the ExAC dataset. If annotation with
              this one use ``--cadd_exac path/to/CADD_ExAC.tsv.gz``.
           -  One with 12.3M InDels from the CADD resources. If annotation with
              this one use ``--cadd_indels path/to/CADD_InDels.txt.gz``.
        
        -  By default the relative cadd scores is annotated with 'CADD=score',
           there is also an alternative to annotate with the raw cadd scores
           using the ``--cadd_raw`` flag. In this case a info field
           'CADD\_raw=score'.
        -  If your VCF is already annotated with VEP, use ``-vep/--vep``
        -  If data is phased use ``-phased/--phased``
        -  If you want to allow compound pairs in intronic regions to use
           ``-gene/--whole_gene``
        -  If you want canonical splice site region to be bigger than 2 base
           pairs on each side of the exons, use
           ``-splice/--splice_padding <integer>``
        -  The ``-strict/--strict`` flag tells **genmod** to only annotate
           genetic models if they are proved by the data. If a variant is not
           called in a family member it will not be annotated.
        
        genmod build\_annotation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            genmod build_annotation [--type] [-o/--outdir] annotation_file
        
        The following file formats are supported for building new annotations:
        
        -  bed
        -  ccds
        -  gtf
        -  gene\_pred
        
        The user can also specify the amount of positions around exon boundaries
        that should be considered as splice sites. Use
        
        ``--splice_padding INTEGER``
        
        genmod analyze
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        From version 1.6 there is also a tool for analyzing the variants
        annotated by **genmod**. This tool will look at all variants in a vcf
        and do an analysis based on which inheritance patterns they follow. The
        variants are then ranked based on the cadd scores, the highest ranked
        variants for each category is printed to screen and the full list for
        each category is printed to new vcf files. Run with:
        
        ::
        
            genmod analyze path/to/file.vcf
        
        For more information do
        
        ::
        
            genmod analyze --help
        
        genmod summarize
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Tool to get basic statistics of the annotated in a vcf file. Run
        
        ::
        
            genmod summarize --help
        
        for more information.
        
        Conditions for Genetic Models
        -----------------------------
        
        Short explanation of genotype calls in VCF format:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Since we only look at humans, that are diploid, the genotypes represent
        what we see on both alleles in a single position. 0 represents the
        reference sequence, 1 is the first of the alternative alleles, 2 second
        alternative and so on. If no phasing has been done the genotype is an
        unordered pair on the form x/x, so 0/1 means that the individual is
        heterozygote in this given position with the reference base on one of
        the alleles and the first of the alternatives on the other. 2/2 means
        that we see the second of the alternatives on both alleles. Some
        chromosomes are only present in one copy in humans, here it is allowed
        to only use a single digit to show the genotype. A 0 would mean
        reference and 1 first of alternatives.
        
        If phasing has been done the pairs are not unordered anymore and the
        delimiter is then changed to '\|', so one can be heterozygote in two
        ways; 0\|1 or 1\|0.
        
        Autosomal Recessive
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For this model individuals can be carriers so healthy individuals can be
        heterozygous. Both alleles need to have the variant for an individual to
        be sick so a healthy individual can not be homozygous alternative and a
        sick individual *has* to be homozygous alternative.
        
        -  Affected individuals have to be homozygous alternative (hom. alt.)
        -  Healthy individuals cannot be hom. alt.
        -  Variant is considered *de novo* if both parents are genotyped and do
           not carry the variant
        
        Autosomal Dominant
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Affected individuals have to be heterozygous (het.)
        -  Healthy individuals cannot have the alternative variant
        -  Variant is considered *de novo* if both parents are genotyped and do
           not carry the variant
        
        Autosomal Compound Heterozygote
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This model includes pairs of exonic variants that are present within the
        same gene. **The default behaviour of GENMOD is to look for compounds
        only in exonic/canonical splice sites**. The reason for this is that
        since some genes have huge intronic regions the data will be drowned in
        compound pairs. If the user wants all variants in genes checked use the
        flag -gene/--whole\_gene.
        
        1. Non-phased data:
        
           -  Affected individuals have to be het. for both variants
           -  Healthy individuals can be het. for one of the variants but cannot
              have both variants
           -  Variant is considered *de novo* if only one or no variant is found
              in the parents
        
        2. Phased data:
        
           -  All affected individuals have to be het. for both variants **and**
              the variants has to be on two different alleles
           -  Healthy individuals can be heterozygous for one but cannot have
              both variants
           -  If only one or no variant is found in parents it is considered *de
              novo*
        
        X-Linked Dominant
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        These traits are inherited on the x-chromosome, of which men have one
        allele and women have two.
        
        -  Variant has to be on chromosome X
        -  Affected individuals have to be het. or hom. alt.
        -  Healthy males cannot carry the variant
        -  Healthy females can carry the variant (because of X inactivation)
        -  If sex is male the variant is considered *de novo* if mother is
           genotyped and does not carry the variant
        -  If sex is female variant is considered *de novo* if none of the
           parents carry the variant
        
        X Linked Recessive
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Variant has to be on chromosome X
        -  Affected males have to be het. or hom. alt. (het is theoretically not
           possible in males, but can occur due to Pseudo Autosomal Regions).
        -  Affected females have to be hom. alt.
        -  Healthy females cannot be hom. alt.
        -  Healthy males cannot carry the variant
        -  If sex is male the variant is considered *de novo* if mother is
           genotyped and does not carry the variant
        -  If sex is female variant is considered *de novo* if not both parents
           carry the variant
