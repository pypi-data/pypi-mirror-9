****************************************
Helper for django CMS plugin development
****************************************

djangocms-helper is a set of commands to handle django CMS plugins development
process.

It's a modified version of django CMS's own ``develop.py`` script, modified
to handle generic plugins development process.


warning
=======
Since version 0.7 django CMS is no more a hard dependency; install it
manually to enable ``--cms`` option

Common options
==============

* ``--cms``: Loads configuration to properly run a django CMS-based application;
* ``--extra-settings``: Path to a helper file to set extra settings; see
  `Settings section <http://djangocms-helper.readthedocs.org/en/develop/settings.html>`_
  for details;

*****
Usage
*****

The command **must** be executed in the main plugin directory (i.e. in the same
directory as the ``setup.py`` file) as it needs to import files relative to the
current directory.

The basic command structure is::

    djangocms-helper <application> <command> [options ...]

where **<application>** is the django application name and **<command>** is one
of the available commands. Optins vary for each command.

******
Runner
******

By using the integrated runned in the settings file you'll be able to run
the commands without invoking ``djangocms-helper``: see
`Integrate runner <http://djangocms-helper.readthedocs.org/en/develop/runner.html>`_
for reference.

************

************

`djangocms-helper` was written by `Iacopo Spalletti <i.spalletti@nephila.it>`_ with help from
other contributors.

Thanks
======

The general logic and part of the code of the whole application is heavily taken from
`django CMS's <https://github.com/divio/django-cms>`_ own `develop.py` so all the contributors
deserve a huge thanks for their work.
