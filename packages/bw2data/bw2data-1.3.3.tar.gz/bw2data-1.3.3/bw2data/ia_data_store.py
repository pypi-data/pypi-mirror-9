A subclass of ``DataStore`` for impact assessment methods.

IA objects are hierarchically structured, and their identifier uses this structure, like ``('ecological scarcity 2006', 'total', 'natural resources')``. The identifier must be a ``tuple``, i.e. ``()``, not a ``list``, i.e. ``[]``. The identifier should only contain unicode strings, and can be of any length >= 1.

Because impact assessment methods are identified by a tuple of strings, e.g. ``('ReCiPe Endpoint (E,A)', 'human health', 'ionising radiation')``, we need to transform this identifier before it can be used e.g. as a filename. We do this using the :func:`.abbreviate` function, which returns a single unicode string.

Args:
    * *name* (tuple): Name of the IA object to manage. Must be a tuple of unicode strings.
