Description: ===========
        Process Wrapper
        ===========
        
        Process Wrapper is a simple module that executes a command-line style
        program via a context manager. This is useful if you want your script
        to do something that relies on a background process.
        
        This module is conceived because of a need to automate the setup and
        teardown of the Django server when running Robotframework tests. Sample
        usage would look like this::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
        	import robot
            from process_wrapper import run_process
        
            with run_process('python manage.py runserver'):
                robot.run('blackbox_test.robot')
        
        Right now, the process being run is forcefully terminated with a SIGKILL
        or equivalent signal on context exit. Caution is advised.
