        SoundScrape
        ==============
        
        **SoundScrape** makes it super easy to download artists from SoundCloud - even those which don't have download links! It automatically creates ID3 tags as well, which is handy.
        
        Usage
        ---------
        
        First, install it:
        
        ```bash
        pip install soundscrape
        ```
        
        Then, just call soundscrape and the name of the artist you want to scrape:
        
        ```bash
        soundscrape rabbit-i-am
        ```
        
        And you're done! Hooray! Files are stored as mp3s in the format **Artist name - Track title.mp3**.
        
        You can also use the *-n* argument to only download a certain number of songs.
        
        ```bash
        soundscrape rabbit-i-am -n 3
        ```
        
        Sets
        -------
        
        Soundscrape can also download sets, but you have to include the full URL of the set you want to download:
        
        ```bash
        soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/vsauce-awesome/sets/awesome
        ```
        
        Groups
        --------
        
        Soundscrape can also download tracks from SoundCloud groups with the *-g* argument.
        
        ```bash
        soundscrape chopped-and-screwed -gn 2
        ```
        
        Tracks
        --------
        
        Soundscrape can also download specific tracks with *-t*:
        
        ```bash
        soundscrape foolsgoldrecs -t danny-brown-dip
        ```
        
        or with just the straight URL:
        
        ```bash
        soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/foolsgoldrecs/danny-brown-dip
        ```
        
        Likes
        --------
        
        Soundscrape can also download all of an Artist's Liked items with *-l*:
        
        ```bash
        soundscrape troyboi -l
        ```
        
        or with just the straight URL:
        
        ```bash
        soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/troyboi/likes
        ```
        
        High-Quality Downloads Only
        --------
        
        By default, SoundScrape will try to rip everything it can. However, if you only want to download tracks that have an official download available (which are typically at a higher-quality 320kbps bitrate), you can use the *-d* argument.
        
        ```bash
        soundscrape sly-dogg -d
        ```
        
        Issues
        -------
        
        There's probably a lot more that can be done to improve this. Please file issues if you find them!
