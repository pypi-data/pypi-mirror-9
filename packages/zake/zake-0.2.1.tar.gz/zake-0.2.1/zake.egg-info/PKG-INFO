        A python package that works to provide a nice set of testing utilities for the `kazoo`_ library.
        
        It includes the following functionality:
        
        * Storage access (for viewing what was saved/created).
        * Kazoo *mostly* compatible client API.
        * Sync/transaction/create/get/delete... commands.
        * Listener support.
        * And more...
        
        It simplifies testing by providing a client that has a similar API as the kazoo
        client so that your tests (or applications/libraries that use kazoo) do not
        require a real zookeeper server to be  tested with (since this is not available
        in all testing environments).
