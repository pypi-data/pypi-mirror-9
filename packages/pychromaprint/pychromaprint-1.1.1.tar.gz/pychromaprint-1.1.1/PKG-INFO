        ===================================
        
        This is a re-packaged version of `pyacoustid`_ that includes only
        the low-level bindings for the Chromaprint library. See the original
        project for more details. In most cases, you do not need this
        package and should use the original. This is needed for deployment
        of the AcoustID server, because of the "acoustid" package name clash.
