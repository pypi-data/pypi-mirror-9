===========================
libnacl 1.1.0 Release Notes
===========================

This release introduces the addition of high level classes that make using
NaCl even easier.

High level NaCl
===============

The addition of the high level classes give a more pythonic abstraction to
using the underlying NaCl cryptography.

These classes can be found in libnacl.public, libnacl.sign and libnacl.secret.

Easy Nonce Generation
=====================

The new classes will automatically generate a nonce value per encrypted
message. The default nonce which is generated can be found in
`libnacl.utils.time_nonce`.
