===========================
libnacl 1.2.0 Release Notes
===========================

This release introduces the DualKey class, secure key saving and loading, as
well as enhancements to the time_nonce function.

Dual Key Class
==============

Dual Keys are classes which can encrypt and sign data. These classes generate
and maintain both Curve25519 and Ed25519 keys, as well as all methods for both
encryption and signing.

Time Nonce Improvements
=======================

The original time nonce routine used the first 20 chars of the 24 char nonce
for the microsecond timestamp (based on salt's jid), leaving 4 chars for random
data. This new nonce uses far fewer chars for the timestamp by hex encoding the
float of microseconds into just 13 chars, leaving 11 chars of random data. This
makes the default nonce safer and more secure.
