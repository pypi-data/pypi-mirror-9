collective.editskinswitcher Installation
========================================

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install collective.editskinswitcher``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * Get `pythonproducts`_ and install it via::

       python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

   into your Zope instance.

 * Create a file called ``collective.editskinswitcher-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="collective.editskinswitcher" />

  * Now restart your Zope instance and use portal_setup or the quick
    installer to install collective.editskinswitcher

  * Edit portal_properties/editskin_switch if wanted.

Upgrading
=========

0.2 to 0.3
----------

It is best to go to the quick installer and uninstall the previous
version before upgrading.  Else you are left with an Access Rule and
an External Method called 'switchskin' in your Plone Site.  Removing
it manually should work, but you will run into errors before you have
done that.  They can look like this::

    File ".../parts/zope2/lib/python/Products/ExternalMethod/ExternalMethod.py", line 159, in reloadIfChanged
      ts=os.stat(self.filepath())[stat.ST_MTIME]
  TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, NoneType found

Now go to the quick installer and install this product.
