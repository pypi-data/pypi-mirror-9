Installation Instructions
=========================

If you want to experiment with TestFixtures, the easiest way to
install it is to do the following in a virtualenv::

  pip install testfixtures

If your package uses setuptools and you decide to use TestFixtures,
then you should do one of the following:

- Specify ``testfixtures`` in the ``tests_require`` parameter of your
  package's call to ``setup`` in :file:`setup.py`.

- Add an ``extra_requires`` parameter in your call to ``setup`` as
  follows:

  .. code-block:: python

    setup(
        # other stuff here
        extras_require=dict(
            test=['testfixtures'],
            )
        )

.. topic:: Python version requirements

  This package has been tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 to 3.4 on Linux,
  Mac OS X and Windows.
