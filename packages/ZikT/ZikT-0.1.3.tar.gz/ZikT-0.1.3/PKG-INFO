Description: What is ZikT?
        =============
        ZikT creates charts like pie charts and bar charts for LaTeX documents.
        Therefore, ZikT turns table data into TikZ_ code, that can be embedded or inputted in
        any LaTeX document. TikZ (and the underlying PGF) is a macro package for TeX_. You
        can find beautiful examples for graphics created with TikZ on texample.net_.
        
        ZikT can be used as Python library to create TikZ code for charts from you own Python
        stuff. ZikT can also be used as script that reads in CSV_ data, takes a chart
        specification and prints out the resulting TikZ code to stdout. A sample usage of this
        script on Linux is
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
        	zikt -l mydata.csv -r "BarChart(additionalBarStyle='fill=red')" > mychart.tex
        
        .. _TikZ: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/
        
        .. _TeX: http://www.tug.org/
        
        .. _texample.net: http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/
        
        .. _CSV: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values
        
        Currently, ZikT supports these chart types:
        
        * bar charts
        * grouped bar charts
        * stacked bar charts
        * pie charts
        * plot charts
        
        ZikT is in an early and experimental state and lacks a lot of important features like the
        creation of a chart legend. Working features are for example a flexible way to specify
        labels and automated axis labeling.
        
        Further Information
        ===================
        
        Do I need to know LaTeX to use ZikT?
        ------------------------------------
        Well, some very basic knowledge to embed the TikZ code and to compile the document is needed.
        But―of cause―you will need to know LaTeX if you want to write documents around your charts. :)
        
        Do I need to know TikZ/PGF to use ZikT?
        ---------------------------------------
        No. But if you do, you will have more options to style your charts and you will be able to
        manipulate and extend ZikTs output manually.
        
        Can I use ZikT without programming Python?
        ------------------------------------------
        I have written a simple command line front end for ZikT. It enables you to read in a CSV file and to
        print out the charts TikZ code to stdout. This front end script is ``zikt.py`` which can be found 
        within the ``zikt`` package.  
        
        Is there any further documentation?
        -----------------------------------
        I’m working on a LaTeX based documentation but it is
        in an even earlier state than ZikT itself (surprise!).
        It is currently not available with the package.
        If you are intrested in this, let me know and maybe I will hurry up a little with the documentation.
        
        Short example for programmatic usage?
        -------------------------------------
        Okay.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        	from zikt.tables import FloatTable
        	from zikt.barchart import BarChart
        	
        	data = [
        		['A','B','C'],
        		[2,12,-3]
        		]
        	
        	table = FloatTable(data)
        	
        	chart = BarChart()
        	
        	chartCode = chart.render(table)
        	
        	print "\\begin{tikzpicture}"
        	print chartCode
        	print "\\end{tikzpicture}"
        
        Pipe the output of this program into a file in a an empty directory. On Linux it may
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
        	./upper_script.py > diagram.tex
        
        The TikZ output of ZikT depends on several color and TikZ definitions that are located
        in `zikt.sty`, delivered with the package in the `latex` sub package. As a convenience
        function, the `zikt` script can print it to stdout. So, the easiest option is to use a
        `zikt.sty` copy for each LaTeX document containing ZikT charts. Create that `zikt.sty`
        in your working directory. On Linux it may look like this:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
        	zikt --printsty > zikt.sty
        	
        Last but not least you need the surrounding document. Create `mydoc.tex` with something
        like following content: 
        
        .. code-block:: tex
        
        	\documentclass{scrartcl}
        	\usepackage{zikt}
        	\begin{document}
        	 \input{diagram}
        	\end{document}
        
        Compile that file with a compatible LaTeX compiler.
        I would use `lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode mydoc.tex`.
        You should have a very senseless `mydoc.pdf` then where
        you can see a very basic ZikT bar chart.
