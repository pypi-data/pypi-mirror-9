TermRecord
----------

TermRecord is a program that wraps the ``script`` command.  It automagically
detects your terminal size, records your session, and stores the output as
either JSON, embeddable JavaScript, or a static HTML file.  The HTML is
completely self-contained, embedding all necessary dependencies in one file
and can be shipped to anyone that has a modern browser.  It even embeds a
font!

You can store these files as your own notes, email them to collaborators,
use them as instructional examples, or whatever you want!  Because they are
self-contained there are no third-party middlemen involved, you are free to
share and keep them forever---they will never go away!
