Description: 
        TermRecord
        ----------
        
        TermRecord is a program that wraps the ``script`` command.  It automagically
        detects your terminal size, records your session, and stores the output as
        either JSON, embeddable JavaScript, or a static HTML file.  The HTML is
        completely self-contained, embedding all necessary dependencies in one file
        and can be shipped to anyone that has a modern browser.  It even embeds a
        font!
        
        You can store these files as your own notes, email them to collaborators,
        use them as instructional examples, or whatever you want!  Because they are
        self-contained there are no third-party middlemen involved, you are free to
        share and keep them forever---they will never go away!
