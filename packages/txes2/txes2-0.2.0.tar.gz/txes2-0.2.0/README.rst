Before We Begin
---------------

This repo is simply a fork of `txes <https://github.com/jkoelker/txes>`_, however, the API has changed enough that I believe a name change was warranted. I also am not representing it as a fork on Github to avoid getting it confused with the 12 other forks of txes that have taken the software in different directions. So for clarity: I am not the original author of this library, `jkoelker <https://github.com/jkoelker>`_ is. Thanks to all the other contributers who helped make this happen, listed in the Contributors_ section.
