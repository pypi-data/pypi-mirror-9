        ## Installation
        The scripts can be installed by running the following command:
        
            python setup.py develop
        
        This will also install mercurial, mozinstall and mozmill if required.
        
        ## Addons
        The `testrun_addons` script executes available Mozmill tests for add-ons,
        which should usually be hosted at http://addons.mozilla.org.
        
        The `testrun_compat_addons` script is a special testrun to execute add-on
        compatibility tests for Firefox, which ensures that major add-ons are still
        working as expected for a new major release of Firefox.
        
        ## Endurance
        The `testrun_endurance` script executes the endurance tests for Firefox,
        which are long running tests to measure the memory usage and performance of
        Firefox.
        
        ## Functional
        The `testrun_functional` script executes functional tests for Firefox, which
        are UI and integration tests, and are necessary for Mozilla QA for signing
        off from testing a new Firefox release.
        
        ## Localization
        The `testrun_l10n` script executes localization tests for Firefox, which are
        used to check that localized builds of Firefox are working as expected in
        terms of accessibility and graphical output.
        
        ## Remote
        The `testrun_remote` script executes remote tests for Firefox, which are
        similar to the functional tests but make use of remote test cases to prove
        the functionality against real web sites.
        
        ## Update
        The `testrun_update` script executes update tests for Firefox, which ensures
        that an update is always correctly performed for Firefox.
        
        When running update tests, you have the option of providing an update
        channel. The valid update channels are:
        
        * nightly
        * nightlytest
        * aurora
        * auroratest
        * beta
        * betatest
        * release
        * releasetest
        * esr
        * esrtest
        * esr[VERSION]-nightly (for example esr24-nightly)
