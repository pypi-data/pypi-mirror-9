        Introduction
        ============
        
        Are you commonly sharing contents from your Plone site or a site page to a `Facebook`__ account?
        
        __ http://www.facebook.com/
        
        When you use the nice Facebook sharing interface, you have a simple way to customize additional data for the item
        that will be published (mainly: choose a proper image from the remote page).
        However when trying to do this automatically (e.g: you are publishing the link in a `Twitter`__ account that also
        feed a Facebook page) Facebook is choosing an image for you... and often this is not the image you want.
        
        __ http://twitter.com/
        
        How can you solve this? In general you can provide some additional ``meta`` tag information using
        `Open Graph standard`__, customizing many aspect of the way of sharing contents on Facebook.

        Coexistence with sc.social.like
        ===============================
        
        Another very common plugin that add ``meta`` tag in Plone Pages is `sc.social.like`__.
        
        As adding duplicate meta tag is reported as an error by Facebook verification, *collective.fbshare* will
        hide some of the *sc.social.like* HTML elements when both products are installed.
