==================
What's new in v0.4
==================

This is non-backwards-compatible release, due to changes in the way
models are defined. These changes were made after feedback on the initial
design.

The most major change is a new central class ``Model`` used throughout
the pacakge. A ``Model`` instance encompasses a ``Source`` and zero or
more ``PropagationEffect`` instances. This is so that different
source models (e.g., SALT2 or spectral time series models) can be
combined with arbitrary dust models. The best way to think about this
is ``Source`` and ``PropagationEffect`` define the rest-frame behavior
of a SN and dust, and a ``Model`` puts these together to determine the
observer-frame behavior.

- New classes

  - ``sncosmo.Model``: new main container class
  - ``sncosmo.Source``: replaces existing ``Model``
  - ``sncosmo.TimeSeriesSource``: replaces existing ``TimeSeriesModel``
  - ``sncosmo.StretchSource``: replaces existing ``StretchModel``
  - ``sncosmo.SALT2Source``: replaces existing ``SALT2Model``
  - ``sncosmo.PropagationEffect``
  - ``sncosmo.CCM89Dust``
  - ``sncosmo.OD94Dust``
  - ``sncosmo.F99Dust``

- New public functions

  - ``sncosmo.read_griddata_ascii``: Read file with ``phase wave flux`` rows
  - ``sncosmo.read_griddata_fits``
  - ``sncosmo.write_griddata_fits``
  - ``sncosmo.nest_lc``: Nested sampling parameter estimation of SN model
  - ``sncosmo.simulate_vol`` (EXPERIMENTAL): simulation convenience function.

- Built-ins

  - updated SALT2 model URLs
  - added SALT2 version 2.4 (Betoule et al 2014)

- Improvements to ``sncosmo.plot_lc``: flexibility and layout

- Many bugfixes
