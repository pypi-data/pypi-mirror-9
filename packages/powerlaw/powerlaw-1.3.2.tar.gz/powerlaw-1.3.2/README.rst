powerlaw: A Python Package for Analysis of Heavy-Tailed Distributions
=======

`powerlaw` is a toolbox using the statistical methods developed in
`Clauset et al. 2007`__ and `Klaus et al. 2011`__ to determine if a
probability distribution fits a power law. Academics, please cite as:

Basic Usage
-----------------
For the simplest, typical use cases, this tells you everything you need to
know.::

    import powerlaw
    data = array([1.7, 3.2 ...]) # data can be list or numpy array
    results = powerlaw.Fit(data)
    print results.power_law.alpha
    print results.power_law.xmin
    R, p = results.distribution_compare('power_law', 'lognormal')

For more explanation, understanding, and figures, see the working paper,
which illustrates all of powerlaw's features. For details of the math, 
see Clauset et al. 2007, which developed these methods.

This code was developed and tested for Python 2.x with the 
`Enthought Python Distribution`__,  and later amended to be
compatible with 3.x. The full version of Enthought is 
`available for free for academic use`__.

Further Development
-----------------
`powerlaw` is open for further development. If there's a feature you'd like to see in `powerlaw`, `submit an issue <https://github.com/jeffalstott/powerlaw/issues>`_. 
Pull requests and offers for expansion or inclusion in other projects are welcomed and encouraged. The original author of `powerlaw`, Jeff Alstott, is now only writing minor tweaks, so contributions are very helpful.
