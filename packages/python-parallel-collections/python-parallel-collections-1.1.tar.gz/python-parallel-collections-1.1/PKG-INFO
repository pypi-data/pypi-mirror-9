Description: 
            
            This package provides a convenient interface to perform map/filter/reduce style operation on standard Python data structures and generators in multiple processes.
            The parallelism is achieved using the Python 2.7 backport of the concurrent.futures package.
            If you can define your problem in terms of map/reduce/filter operations, it will run on several parallel Python processes on your machine, taking advantage of multiple cores.
