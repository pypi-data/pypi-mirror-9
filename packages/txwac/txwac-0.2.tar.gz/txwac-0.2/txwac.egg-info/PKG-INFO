Description: =====
        txwac
        =====
        
        This is a `Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/>`_ fork of `wac <https://github.com/bninja/wac>`_. See the wac documentation for more details.
        
        This fork operates nearly identically to wac except for these exceptions:
        
        - Everything that hits the wire returns a Deferred
        - Multi-page iteration is not possible
        - len(obj) is not possible on objects that hit the wire to get the count
        - This uses `treq <https://github.com/dreid/treq>`_ which is not 100% compatible with requests. Most notably, headers are handled differently and response objects have slightly different attribute names
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        - Conversion of the original wac tests to trial based tests. The tests that are here will not work correctly
