Updating

How to best update your systems? Don't!

Seriously, updating can be more trouble than it's worth. However, that does not mean you shouldn't stay up-to-date. It just means, that upgrading your systems may not neccessarily be the best way to achieve that.

Instead, an alternative approach is to upgrade your setup (package versions, FreeBSD version etc.) and then create a new instance with the upgraded setup, test that and repeat the process until the upgraded state is working correctly and then replace the old state with the 'upgraded' one.
