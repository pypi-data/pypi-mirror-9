This is a first pass at a contribution doc, and will change, but for starters:

- Incoming code should follow PEP8 (there's a test to help out on this.)
- If you add new core-level features, write some quick docs in the README.  If you're not sure if they're needed, just ask!
- Add your name and attribution to the AUTHORS file.
- Know you have our thanks for helping to make django-seo-js even better!
