Command Line Interface (CLI) for Typesafe ConductR
--------------------------------------------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 3 is required. For OS X users use ``brew install python3``.

Install using pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may either install to all users:

.. code:: bash

    sudo pip3 install typesafe-conductr-cli

... or, and if you’re not using brew (there’s a problem with user installs as of the time writing this), install to the current user (make sure to have ``~/.local/bin`` in your PATH):

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install --user typesafe-conductr-cli

Install as a deb package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build a docker image for building a deb package:

.. code:: bash

    docker build -t debian-distribution deb_dist/

Run built docker image:

.. code:: bash

  docker run -v $(pwd):/source debian-distribution

Install built deb package:

.. code:: bash

    dpkg -i deb_dist/python3-typesafe-conductr-cli_0.1-1_all.deb

Install required dependencies:

.. code:: bash

    apt-get install -f

Autocomplete support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have installed argcomplete and want to activate Bash completion for the CLI, you have to execute the following, either transiently in your terminal session or more permanently in your ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile``:

.. code:: bash

    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete conduct)"

Alternatively, if you have a Bash version 4.2 or later, you can activate global completion once:

.. code:: bash

    activate-global-python-argcomplete --dest=/path/to/bash_completion.d

If you are running zsh, execute the following command to enable autocomplete:

.. code:: bash

    autoload bashcompinit && autoload compinit && bashcompinit && compinit && eval "$(register-python-argcomplete conduct)"

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute the following command to run all defined tests:

.. code:: bash

    python3 setup.py test

Releasing
~~~~~~~~~

CLI releases can be performed completely from the GitHub project page. Follow these steps to cut a release:

1. Edit `setup.py` to contain the version to be released.
2. Create a new release in GitHub `releases page`_.

After CI build is finished for the tagged commit, new version will automatically be deployed to PyPi repository.

CLI Usage
~~~~~~~~~

conduct
^^^^^^^

Execute ``conduct`` with any of the supported sub-commands or options,
e.g.

.. code:: bash

    $ conduct -h
    usage: conduct [-h] {version,info,services,load,run,stop,unload} ...

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    subcommands:
      valid subcommands

      {version,info,services,load,run,stop,unload}
                            help for subcommands
        version             print version
        info                print bundle information
        services            print service information
        load                load a bundle
        run                 run a bundle
        stop                stop a bundle
        unload              unload a bundle

Most sub-commands connect to a ConductR instance and therefore you have to specify its IP and port; if not given, ``CONDUCTR_IP`` environment variable or ``127.0.0.1`` will be used for the IP and ``CONDUCTR_PORT`` or ``9005`` for the port. Alternatively you can specify the IP via the ``--ip`` option and the port via the ``--port`` option.

Here’s an example for loading a bundle:

.. code:: bash

    conduct load \
      --nr-of-cpus 2 \
      --memory 104857600 \
      --disk-space 104857600 \
      --roles web-server \
      -- test-lib/src/main/resources/sbt-typesafe-conductr-tester-1.0.0-e172570d3c0fb11f4f9dbb8de519df58dcb490799f525bab43757f291e1d104d.tgz

Notice that in this example it’s necessary to separate the bundle from the values of the ``--roles`` option with ``--``, else the bundle would be treated as another role and hence the bundle itself would be missing.

In other cases, e.g. if there are no roles given or if the bundle doesn’t come directly after the roles, this is not needed, like in the following example where an additional configuration is loaded:

.. code:: bash

    conduct load \
      --nr-of-cpus 2 \
      --memory 104857600 \
      --disk-space 104857600 \
      test-lib/src/main/resources/sbt-typesafe-conductr-tester-1.0.0-e172570d3c0fb11f4f9dbb8de519df58dcb490799f525bab43757f291e1d104d.tgz \
      test-lib/src/main/resources/configuration-d928496f2c561332621efd3663b9e13ca7608948983f44c9b9cf273b2036e155.tgz

shazar
^^^^^^

The ``shazar`` command can be used:

- for packaging a directory that has a structure of a bundle to a bundle archive;
- for packaging a bundle’s configuration to a bundle archive;

In both cases the source files are zipped and a SHA256 digest of the archive is appended to the bundle archive file name.

For pointers on command usage run ``shazar -h``.
