Description: RPython
        =======
        
        RPython is a translation and support framework for producing implementations of
        dynamic languages, emphasizing a clean separation between language
        specification and implementation aspects.
        
        By separating concerns in this way, our implementation of Python - and other
        dynamic languages - is able to automatically generate a Just-in-Time compiler
        for any dynamic language.  It also allows a mix-and-match approach to
        implementation decisions, including many that have historically been outside of
        a user's control, such as target platform, memory and threading models, garbage
        collection strategies, and optimizations applied, including whether or not to
        have a JIT in the first place.
