Metapub is a Python library that provides python objects fetched via eutils 
that represent papers and concepts found within the NLM.

These objects abstract some interactions with pubmed, and intends to 
encompass as many types of database lookups and summaries as can be 
provided via Eutils / Entrez.

PubMedArticle / PubMedFetcher

Basic usage::

  fetch = PubMedFetcher()
  article = fetch.article_by_pmid('123456')
  print article.title
  print article.journal, article.year, article.volume, article.issue
  print article.authors

MedGenConcept / MedGenFetcher

Basic usage::

  fetch = MedGenFetcher()
  concept = fetch.concept_by_uid('336867')
  print concept.name
  print concept.description
  print concept.associated_genes
  print concept.modes_of_inheritance


CrossRef

The CrossRef object provides an object layer into search.crossref.org's API.
See http://search.crossref.org

CrossRef excels at resolving DOIs into article citation details. 

CrossRef can also be used to resolve a DOI /from/ article citation details, with
a bit of finagling.  The "get_top_result" function was built to do some light
interpretation of the json-based results of a CrossRef lookup.

Result scores under 2.0 are usually False matches.
Result scores over 3.0 are always (?) True.  
Between 2.0 and 3.0 is a grey area: be wary and check results against any known info you may have.

Current testing (as of 1/23/2015) indicates that a cleverly-formed CrossRef 
query can return results 99% correct about 90% of the time.  

The more `params` submitted with the query, the more accurate the results may be. 


Basic usage::

  CR = CrossRef()       # starts the query cache engine
  results = CR(search_string, params)
  top_result = CR.get_top_result(results)

Example starting from a known pubmed ID::

  pma = PubMedFetcher().article_by_pmid(known_pmid)
  results = CR.query_from_PubMedArticle(pma)
  top_result = CR.get_top_result(results, CR.last_params, use_best_guess=True)

NOTE: if you don't supply "CR.last_params", you can't use the "use_best_guess"
operator. In cases where all results have scores under 2, no results will 
be returned unless use_best_guess=True.  That's often desired behavior, 
since results with scores under 2 are usually pretty bad.


Metapub relies on the very neat eutils package created by Reece
Hart, which you can check out here:

http://bitbucket.org/biocommons/eutils

This library is in its very early stages and there's a lot that may
change, and quite a bit planned for implementation in 2015.

Feel free to use the library with confidence that each released version 
is well tested -- and in a couple of cases, some of its code is already
in production -- but until (say) version 0.5, don't expect consistency
between versions.

YMMV, At your own risk, etc.
