Metapub is a Python library that provides python objects fetched via eutils 
that represent papers and concepts found within the NLM.

PubMedArticle / PubMedFetcher

Basic usage::

  fetch = PubMedFetcher()
  article = fetch.article_by_pmid('123456')
  print article.title
  print article.journal, article.year, article.volume, article.issue
  print article.authors

MedGenConcept / MedGenFetcher

Basic usage::

  fetch = MedGenFetcher()
  concept = fetch.concept_by_uid('336867')
  print concept.name
  print concept.description
  print concept.associated_genes
  print concept.modes_of_inheritance


These objects abstract some interactions with pubmed, and intends to 
encompass as many types of database lookups and summaries as can be 
provided via Eutils / Entrez.

Metapub relies on the very neat eutils package created by Reece
Hart, which you can check out here:

This library is in its very early stages and there's a lot that may
change, and quite a bit planned for implementation in 2014-2015.

Feel free to use the library with confidence that each released version 
is well tested -- and in a couple of cases, some of its code is already
in production -- but until (say) version 0.5, don't expect consistency
between versions.

YMMV, At your own risk, etc.
