pyRobotics
==========

A Python API to create modules that connect to our BlackBoard (our "home-made" message-passing and shared variables hub... somewhat equivalent to ROS)
(We also have a C# and C++ APIs, although the latter is also under development and has not been tested thoroughly.)

These softwares are all part of the work developed at the Bio-Robotics Laboratory at UNAM, and are used in our service robots.

### Documentation

The documentation for pyRobotics is [here](http://bioroboticsUNAM.github.io/pyRobotics). Examples can be found in the [github repository](http://github.com/BioRoboticsUNAM/pyRobotics).
It is still in beta testing.
If someone should be interested in knowing more about any of these projects, you can contact me at adrianrc[dot]89[at]gmail[dot]com.

### Installation

To install the library from a distutils package (pyRobotics-<version>.tar.gz), simply run `python setup.py install`. (You might need super user permissions)

### IMPORTANT NOTE

The files at the top level folder in the [source repository](http://github.com/BioRoboticsUNAM/pyRobotics) are examples, the actual library is in the pyRobotics folder.
