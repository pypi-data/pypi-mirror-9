A reusable app that provides better app integration with AngularJS.  Djangular
allows you to create AngularJS content per app, instead of creating a single
massive AngularJS application inside of Django.  This allows you to selectively
use apps per site, as well as create a consistent structure across all of your
Django apps.

This is intended to be a Django version of the angular-seed project
(https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).  The current mindset is to limit the
amount of changes introduced by Djangular.
