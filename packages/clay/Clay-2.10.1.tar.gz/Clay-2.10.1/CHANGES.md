    clay new myproject https://github.com/lucuma/clay-template.git

- Added Markdown support with automatic source code highlighting. 

- Fix bug with the Jinja IncludeWith extension and line breaks


## Version 2.5

- GET and POST values are automatically added to the context.


## Version 2.4

- Dropped the Werkzeug's server for the more robust CherryPy's Server (Cheroot).

- Added pattern matching (UNIX style) to the lists of FILTER and IGNORE.

- Many improvements to the `active` helper function:

    * You can now specify many url patterns as arguments without having to
      use a list. Eg:

        {{ active('/url1/', '/url2/', '/url3/', partial=True) }}

    * Added pattern matching

        {{ active('/foo/*') }}

    * Relative URLs now work as well. For example, if the current URL is
      `/foo/bar.html`, this will match:

        {{ active('bar.html') }}


## Version 2.3

- _index.txt lists all the pages that also would appear in _index.html.


## Version 2.1 - 2.2

- Several bugfixes


## Version 2.0

TDD rewrite. Most important new features:

- _index.html now is viewable in run mode.

- No need to filter non-html files. Only those ending in ".html" or ".tmpl" are processed as templates.

- Adaptative run port (if it is taken, Clay try to use the next one).

- The "not found" page now shows the real missing templates (for example, when an "imported" template is the one missing).
