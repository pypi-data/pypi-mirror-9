        Python Redmine is a library for communicating with a `Redmine <http://www.redmine.org>`_
        project management application. Redmine exposes some of it's data via `REST API
        <http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api>`_ for which Python Redmine provides
        a simple but powerful Pythonic API inspired by a well-known `Django ORM
        <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/>`_:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from redmine import Redmine
        
            >>> redmine = Redmine('http://demo.redmine.org', username='foo', password='bar')
            >>> project = redmine.project.get('vacation')
        
            >>> project.id
            30404
        
            >>> project.identifier
            'vacation'
        
            >>> project.created_on
            datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 31, 13, 27, 47)
        
            >>> project.issues
            <redmine.resultsets.ResourceSet object with Issue resources>
        
            >>> project.issues[0]
            <redmine.resources.Issue #34441 "Vacation">
        
            >>> dir(project.issues[0])
            ['assigned_to', 'author', 'created_on', 'description', 'done_ratio',
            'due_date', 'estimated_hours', 'id', 'priority', 'project', 'relations',
            'start_date', 'status', 'subject', 'time_entries', 'tracker', 'updated_on']
        
            >>> project.issues[0].subject
            'Vacation'
        
            >>> project.issues[0].time_entries
            <redmine.resultsets.ResourceSet object with TimeEntry resources>

        - Fixed: `Issue #76 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/76>`__ (It was impossible
          to retrieve more than 100 resources for resources which don't support limit/offset natively by
          Redmine, i.e. this functionality is emulated by Python Redmine, e.g. WikiPage, Groups, Roles etc)

        - Fixed: `Issue #50 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/50>`__ (IssueJournal's
          ``notes`` attribute was converted to Note resource by mistake, bug was introduced in v1.0.0)
        
        1.0.0 (2014-09-22)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Added: Support for the `CRM plugin <http://redminecrm.com/projects/crm/pages/1>`_ resources:

          * User - issues, time_entries, deals and contacts relations
          * Tracker - issues relation
          * IssueStatus - issues relation
        
        - Added: Introduced a ``values()`` method in a ResourceSet which returns ValuesResourceSet — a
          ResourceSet subclass that returns dictionaries when used as an iterable, rather than resource-instance
          objects (see `docs <http://python-redmine.readthedocs.org/operations.html#filter>`__ for details)
        - Added: Introduced ``update()`` and ``delete()`` methods in a ResourceSet object which allow to
          bulk update or bulk delete all resources in a ResourceSet object (see `docs <http://python-redmine.
          readthedocs.org/operations.html#filter>`__ for details)
        - Fixed: It was impossible to use ResourceSet's ``get()`` and ``filter()`` methods with WikiPage
          resource
        - Fixed: Several small fixes and enhancements here and there
        
        0.9.0 (2014-09-11)

          org/advanced/working_with_files.html>`__ for details)
        - Added: Introduced new ``_Resource.requirements`` class attribute where all Redmine plugins
          required by resource should be listed (preparations to support non-native resources)
        - Added: New exceptions:
        
          * ResourceRequirementsError
        
        - Fixed: It was impossible to set a custom field of date/datetime type using date/datetime
          Python objects
        - Fixed: `Issue #46 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/46>`__
          (A UnicodeEncodeError was raised in Python 2.x while trying to access a ``url`` property of
          a WikiPage resource if it contained non-ascii characters)
        
        0.8.4 (2014-08-08)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Added: Support for anonymous Attachment resource (i.e. attachment with ``id`` attr only)
        - Fixed: `Issue #42 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/42>`__ (It was
          impossible to create a Project resource via ``new()`` method)
        
        0.8.3 (2014-08-01)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed: `Issue #39 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/39>`__ (It was
          impossible to save custom_fields in User resource via ``new()`` method)
        
        0.8.2 (2014-05-27)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Added: ResourceSet's ``get()`` method now supports a ``default`` keyword argument which is
          returned when a requested Resource can't be found in a ResourceSet and defaults to ``None``,
          previously this was hardcoded to ``None``
        - Added: It is now possible to use ``getattr()`` with default value without raising a
          ``ResourceAttrError`` when calling non-existent resource attribute, see `Issue #30
          <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/30>`__ for details (thanks to
          `hsum <https://github.com/hsum>`__)
        - Fixed: `Issue #31 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/31>`__ (Unlimited

        - Fixed: `Issue #27 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/27>`__ (Project and
          Issue resources ``parent`` attribute was returned as a dict instead of being converted to
          Resource object)
        
        0.8.0 (2014-03-27)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Added: Introduced the detection of conflicting packages, i.e. if a conflicting package is
          found (PyRedmineWS at this time is the only one), the installation procedure will be aborted
          and a warning message will be shown with the detailed description of the problem
        - Added: Introduced new ``_Resource._members`` class attribute where all instance attributes
          which are not started with underscore should be listed. This will resolve recursion issues
          in custom resources because of how ``__setattr__()`` works in Python
        - Changed: ``_Resource.attributes`` renamed to ``_Resource._attributes``
        - Fixed: Python Redmine was unable to upload any binary files
        - Fixed: `Issue #20 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/20>`__ (Lowered

          via ``update()`` method didn't work)
        
        0.7.2 (2014-03-17)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed: `Issue #19 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/19>`__ (Resources
          obtained via ``filter()`` and ``all()`` methods have incomplete url attribute)
        - Fixed: Redmine server url with forward slash could cause errors in rare cases
        - Fixed: Python Redmine was incorrectly raising ``ResourceAttrError`` when trying to call
          ``repr()`` on a News resource
        
        0.7.1 (2014-03-14)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed: `Issue #16 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/16>`__ (When a resource
          was created via a ``new()`` method, the next resource created after that inherited all the
          attribute values of the previous resource)
        
        0.7.0 (2014-03-12)
        ++++++++++++++++++

          Redmine in case if some of them are not available in an existent resource object
        - Added: Support for setting date/datetime resource attributes using date/datetime Python objects
        - Added: Support for using date/datetime Python objects in all ResourceManager methods, i.e.
          ``new()``, ``create()``, ``update()``, ``delete()``, ``get()``, ``all()``, ``filter()``
        - Fixed: `Issue #14 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/14>`__ (Python Redmine
          was incorrectly raising ``ResourceAttrError`` when trying to call ``repr()``, ``str()`` and
          ``int()`` on resources, created via ``new()`` method)
        
        0.6.2 (2014-03-09)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed: Project resource ``status`` attribute was converted to IssueStatus resource by mistake

        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Added: ``Redmine.auth()`` shortcut for the case if we just want to check if user provided
          valid auth credentials, can be used for user authentication on external resource based on
          Redmine user database (see `docs <http://python-redmine.readthedocs.org/advanced/
          external_auth.html>`__ for details)
        - Fixed: ``JSONDecodeError`` was raised in some Redmine versions during some create/update
          operations (thanks to `0x55aa <https://github.com/0x55aa>`__)
        - Fixed: User resource ``status`` attribute was converted to IssueStatus resource by mistake
        
        0.5.0 (2014-02-09)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Added: An ability to create custom resources which allow to easily redefine the behaviour
          of existing resources (see `docs <http://python-redmine.readthedocs.org/advanced/
          custom_resources.html>`__ for details)

          `Andrei Avram <https://github.com/andreiavram>`__)
        - Added: An ability to return ``None`` instead of raising a ``ResourceAttrError`` for all
          or selected resource objects via ``raise_attr_exception`` kwarg on Redmine object (see
          `docs <http://python-redmine.readthedocs.org/configuration.html#exception-control>`__ for

          object methods which can be used to execute tasks that should be done before/after
          creating/updating the resource through ``save()`` method
        - Added: Allow to create resources in alternative way via ``new()`` method (see `docs
          <http://python-redmine.readthedocs.org/operations.html#new>`__ for details)
        - Added: Allow daterange TimeEntry resource filtering via ``from_date`` and ``to_date``
          keyword arguments (thanks to `Antoni Aloy <https://github.com/aaloy>`__)
        - Added: An ability to retrieve Issue version via ``version`` attribute in addition to
          ``fixed_version`` to be more obvious
        - Changed: Documentation for resources rewritten from scratch to be more understandable
        - Fixed: Saving custom fields to Redmine didn't work in some situations
        - Fixed: Issue's ``fixed_version`` attribute was retrieved as dict instead of Version resource
          object
        - Fixed: Resource relations were requested from Redmine every time instead of caching the
          result after first request
        - Fixed: `Issue #2 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/2>`__ (limit/offset
          as keyword arguments were broken)
        - Fixed: `Issue #5 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/5>`__ (Version
          resource ``status`` attribute was converted to IssueStatus resource by mistake) (thanks
          to `Andrei Avram <https://github.com/andreiavram>`__)
        - Fixed: A lot of small fixes, enhancements and refactoring here and there
