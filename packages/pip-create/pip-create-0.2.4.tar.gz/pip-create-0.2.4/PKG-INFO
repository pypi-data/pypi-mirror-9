Description: pip-create
        ==========
        
        Tools to simplify the process of creating and sharing Python distributions to `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.
        
        This is a fork of `pip-init <https://github.com/juanpabloaj/pip-init>`_ by `@juanpabloaj <https://github.com/juanpabloaj>`_. The primary difference is that it makes use of the `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ templating engine to make the code templates more extensible.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        ::
        
            pip install pip-create
        
        Or, you can clone this repository, navigate to the directory in which you cloned this repository, and do a
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            pip-create
        
        
        ...and then just follow the interactive prompts. Once you're done, you'll have a bright, new, shiny `setup.py`.
