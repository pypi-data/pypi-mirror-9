# chromalog

Enhance Python logging mechanism with colors and the ability to highlight part
of the logged output.

**chromalog** works on all main platforms and is able to detect whether the
displaying terminal actually has color support.

## Contribution

Contributions to `chromalog` are most welcome ! However, please note that the
continuous integration process enforces the following things:

* All unit-tests/doc-tests must pass.
* No pep8 error are found, neither in the code or the tests.
* Coverage is 100%.

You obviously need to write tests whenever you add/modify a feature. Don't
forget to update the relevant documentation entries as well.

This may seem crazy but I firmly believe that those things help maintain a
higher code quality and reduce the chances of bugs.

Feel free to ask for help if you are stuck writing tests or are not sure what
to test/how to document.
