Chromalog integrates seemlessly in any Python project and allows the use of
colors in log messages and generic output easily. It is based on colorama and
so works on both Windows and *NIX platforms. Chromalog is able to detect
without any configuration if the associated output stream has color
capabilities and can fall back to the default monochromatic logging.

Chromalog also offer helpers to easily highlight some important parts of a log
message.
