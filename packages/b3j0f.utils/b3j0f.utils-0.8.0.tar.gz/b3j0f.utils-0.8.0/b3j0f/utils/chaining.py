class Chaining(object):

    Class which permits to process chaining of routines/attr such as call
        chaining in javascript.

    In order to chain calls, start to embed an object, then call embedded
    object methods which returns all the Chaining object. Finally, if you want
    to get back method results, use Chaining.__getitem__ method where the index
    corresponds to the order of calls. Therefore

    For example:
    >>> chaining = Chaining('example').upper().capitalize()
    >>> chaining += '.'
    >>> chaining[0]
    'EXAMPLE'
    >>> chaining[1]
    'Example'
    >>> chaining[2]
    'example.'

    'example.'

    ['EXAMPLE', 'Example', 'example.']
