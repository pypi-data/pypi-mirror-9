Description: Pyarmor, Guard your python scripts
        ==================================
        
        Do you worry about how to protect your python scripts?  Now, it's easy
        with the coming of Pyarmor.
        
        What's Pyarmor
        --------------
        
        A python package could import/run encrypted python scripts.
        
        Pyarmor is designed for developers who do not want distribute literal
        python scripts to their customers.
        
        Here are the main differences of using pyarmor to run/import encrypted
        python scripts:
        
        * transform python script to encrypted one with extension ".pyx"
        * add a few of auxiliary files
        
        It means Pyarmor almost doesn't change anything, you can run/import
        encrypted pythons scripts just as they're not encrypted. So you can
        run/import encrypted python scripts in any environment which python
        can run. For example, in a web framework, or as cgi scripts.
        
        Besides, Pyarmor could run/import encrypted python scripts in target
        machine as one of the following ways:
        
        * Any target machine, or
        * only in a special machine (bind to hard disk serial number), or
        * expried on some day
        
        Get it
        ======
        
        Download the source package from
        
          https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyarmor
        
        then extract the downloaded package to any path.
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        Pyarmor is command line tool, the main script is "pyarmor.py", you can
        run it by python2.6 later::
        
          $ python pyarmor.py
        
        There is a gui wizard to show how to use pyarmor, be sure you have
        installed python and tkinter, start pyarmor wizard
        
          $ python wizard.py
        
        The wizard is tested in Python2.7/Python3.2. There are many examples
        introduced in this wizard, it's useful to understand all of the
        featuers of Pyarmor.
