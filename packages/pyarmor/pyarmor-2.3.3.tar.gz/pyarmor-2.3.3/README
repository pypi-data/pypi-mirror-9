Pyarmor, Guard your python scripts
==================================

Do you worry about how to protect your python scripts?  Now, it's easy
with the coming of Pyarmor.

What's Pyarmor
--------------

A python package could import/run encrypted python scripts.

Pyarmor is designed for developers who do not want distribute literal
python scripts to their customers.

Here are the main differences of using pyarmor to run/import encrypted
python scripts:

* transform python script to encrypted one with extension ".pyx"
* add a few of auxiliary files

It means Pyarmor almost doesn't change anything, you can run/import
encrypted pythons scripts just as they're not encrypted. So you can
run/import encrypted python scripts in any environment which python
can run. For example, in a web framework, or as cgi scripts.

Besides, Pyarmor could run/import encrypted python scripts in target
machine as one of the following ways:

* Any target machine, or
* only in a special machine (bind to hard disk serial number), or
* expried on some day
