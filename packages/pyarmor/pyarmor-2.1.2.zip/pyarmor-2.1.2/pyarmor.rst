Pyarmor, Guard your python scripts
==================================

Do you worry about how to protect your python scripts?  Now, it's easy
with the coming of Pyarmor.

What's Pyarmor
--------------

A python package could import/run encrypted python scripts.

Who Use Pyarmor
---------------

A python developer wants to release his project, but do not want to
publish the literal scripts. What should he do?

* Use pyarmor to encrypt the python scripts
* Distribute encrypted python scripts to the customer

That's all.

Supported Python Versions
-------------------------

Pyarmor need python 2.6 or later, but it supports to run/import the
encrypted scripts from Python 2.3 to the latest Python by Cross
Publish (See below).

Supported platforms
-------------------

Windows, Linux, including Embeded Linux are supported, The following
operation systems have been tested:

* Windows XP, Windows7 both x86 and amd64
* Ubuntu 13.04 both i686, x86_64 and armv7

Conception
==========

Project Capsule
---------------

A zip file includes all the auxiliary files which used to import the
encrypted scripts. It's generated by Pyarmor.

Installation
============

* Install corresponding Python

* Run pip to install pyarmor package from pypi.python.org

    $ pip install pyarmor

* Or download the package from pypi.python.org

* Extract the downloaded package to any path, for example,
  c:/pyarmor or /opt/pyarmor

Wizard
======

There is a gui wizard to show how to use pyarmor, be sure you have
installed python and tkinter:

  `Start pyarmor wizard,`::

  $ python wizard.py

The wizard is tested in Python2.7/Python3.2. There are many examples
introduced in this wizard, it's useful to understand all of the
featuers of Pyarmor.

Basic Usage
===========

The normal scenario for a developer to use pyarmor is

* Generate project capsule for each project
* Encrypt python scripts with project capsule

Then

* Distribute the encrypted scripts to target machine

Next it's an example to show you how to use pyarmor to encrypt scripts
and how to distribute encrypted scripts.

Encrypt Script
--------------

Assume you have 2 scripts: moda.py modb.py,

* Generate project capsule

  `For example,`::

  $ python pyarmor.py capsule

  It will make a file "project.zip" in the current directory.

* Encrypt python scripts

  `For example,`::

     $ python pyarmor.py encrypt --with-capsule=project.zip \
       moda.py modb.py

  After above command finished, you will find the following files in
  the path "dist"

    * moda.pyx
    * modb.pyx

    * pyimcore.py
    * pytransform.pyd (for windows) or pytransform.so (for linux)
    * cygtfm-0.dll / libtfm-0.dll (only for windows)
    * cygtomcrypt-0.dll / libtomcrypt-0.dll (only for windows)
    * pyshield.key
    * pyshield.lic
    * product.key
    * license.lic

  The first 2 files are encrypted scripts, the others are
  auxiliary. All of these files is required when distribute encrypted
  scripts.

  `About more usage of pyarmor`::

      C:/Python32/python pyarmor --help

      C:/Python32/python pyarmor encrypt --help

Distribute Script
-----------------

Before you distribute encrypted scripts above, you need change a
little in your main script -- add a line 'import pyimcore' before
import those encrypted module. Assume your startup script is main.py,
what you will do is add a line in the file header somewhere.

`For example,`::

  import pyimore

The main function of pyimcore is to install an import hook, so that
the encrypted module will be imported correctly. For you, everything
is transparent, all of the source code need to be changed nothing
else !

Now copy the following files to your customer:

  * main.py
  * moda.pyx
  * modb.pyx

  * pyimcore.py
  * pytransform.pyd (for windows) or pytransform.so (for linux)
  * cygtfm-0.dll / libtfm-0.dll (only for windows)
  * cygtomcrypt-0.dll / libtomcrypt-0.dll (only for windows)
  * pyshield.key
  * pyshield.lic
  * product.key
  * license.lic

And run it as if there are no any encrypted scripts.

Generate Special "license.lic"
------------------------------

By default, the distribute path will include a file "license.lic",
it's required to run/import encrypted scripts. You can generate other
license file by command "license" for special users.

`Generate license.lic with registration code "MYPROJECT-001"`::

    $ python pyarmor.py license --with-capsule=project.zip MYPROJECT-001

This command will generate a new "license.lic" with registration code
"MYPROJECT-001", replace the old with this one in "dist" path.

Advanced Usage
==============

Run Encrypted Script
--------------------

Someone maybe say I want to encrypt my startup script either, then how
to run it.

`Encrypt the script at first,`::

    $ python pyarmor.py encrypt --with-capsule=project.zip \
      main.py moda.py modb.py

`Run python with -c, for example,`::

  python -c "import pyimcore
  import pytransform
  pytransform.exec_file('main.pyx')"

`Or create a startup script startup.py like this,`::

  import pyimcore
  import pytransform
  pytransform.exec_file('main.pyx')

Then run startup.py as normal python script.

You can read the source file pyarmor.py to know the basic usage of
pytransform extension.

Cross Publish
-------------

If target machine is different from development machine, you need use
option '--with-extension' to publish encrypted scripts. A common case
is to distribute python scripts to embedded linux system. The only
difference is to replace python extension "pytransform" with the
corresponding platform. 

* In the sub-directory "extensions" of pyarmor, there are many files
  looks like:

    pytransform-1.7.2.win32-ARCH-pyX.Y.pyd

    pytransform-1.7.2.linux-ARCH-pyX.Y.so

X.Y is python major and minor version, ARCH may be x86, x86_64, arm etc.

`Encrypt scripts with option --with-extension`::

  $ python pyarmor.py encrypt --with-capsule=project.zip \
    --with-extension=extensions/pytransform-1.7.2.linux-arm-py2.so \
    main.py moda.py modb.py

`Another example, encrypted scripts for Python2.3`::

  $ python3  pyarmor.py encrypt --with-capsule=project.zip \
    --with-extension=extensions/pytransform-1.7.2.win32-x86-py2.3.pyd \
    main.py moda.py modb.py


Generate "license.lic" For Special Machine
------------------------------------------

Sometimes you want to run/import encrypted scripts in special
machine. You can generate a "license.lic" bind to serial number of
hard disk. 

`Generate license.lic with serial number of hard disk "PBN2081SF3NJ5T"`::

    $ python pyarmor.py license --with-capsule=project.zip --bind PBN2081SF3NJ5T

This command will generate a new "license.lic" bind to harddisk which
serial number is "PBN2081SF3NJ5T", replace the old with this one in
"dist" path. 

Generate Periodic "license.lic"
-------------------------------

`Generate license.lic which will be expired in Jan. 31, 2015`::

    $ python pyarmor.py license --with-capsule=project.zip \
      ----expired-date 2015-01-31

This command will generate a new "license.lic" will be expired in
Jan. 31, 2015.

FAQ
===

* Q: Will the license expire? Is the license the same for develop
     machine and target machine?

  A: "license.lic" for pyarmor will expired about by the end of next
     month.  After that, a registration code is required to run
     pyarmor.

     The "license.lic" in the target machine is different from develop
     machine, it is generated by pyarmor. Simply to say, "license.lic"
     of pyarmor is generated by me, "license.lic" in the target
     machine is generated by developer who uses pyarmor.

* Q: If I pay for the registration code, it is valid forever? Or I
     have to pay periodically?  

  A: Forever now.
