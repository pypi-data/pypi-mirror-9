        .. note ::
        
          This add-on doesn't do anything by itself. It needs to be integrated by a
          developer within your own products. For reference you can check
          the `eea.daviz`_ package.

        Installation
        ============
        
        zc.buildout
        -----------
        If you are using `zc.buildout`_ and the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Update your buildout.cfg file:
        
          * Add ``eea.forms`` to the list of eggs to install
          * Tell the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_ recipe to install a ZCML slug
        
          ::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            eggs =
              ...
              eea.forms
        
            zcml =
              ...
              eea.forms
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
        
        * Install eea.forms within Site Setup > Add-ons
