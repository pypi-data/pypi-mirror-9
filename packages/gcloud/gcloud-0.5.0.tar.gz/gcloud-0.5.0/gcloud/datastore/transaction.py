from gcloud.datastore.batch import Batch


class Transaction(Batch):
    """An abstraction representing datastore Transactions.

    Transactions can be used to build up a bulk mutuation as well as
    provide isolation.

    For example, the following snippet of code will put the two ``save``
    operations (either ``insert_auto_id`` or ``upsert``) into the same
    mutation, and execute those within a transaction::

      >>> from gcloud import datastore

      >>> with datastore.Transaction():
      ...     datastore.put([entity1, entity2])

    Because it derives from :class:`Batch`, :class`Transaction` also provides
    :meth:`put` and :meth:`delete` methods::

      >>> with datastore.Transaction() as xact:
      ...     xact.put(entity1)
      ...     xact.delete(entity2.key)

    By default, the transaction is rolled back if the transaction block
    exits with an error::

      >>> with datastore.Transaction():
      ...     do_some_work()
      ...     raise SomeException()  # rolls back

    If the transaction block exists without an exception, it will commit
    by default.

    .. warning:: Inside a transaction, automatically assigned IDs for
       entities will not be available at save time!  That means, if you
       try::

         >>> with datastore.Transaction():
         ...     entity = datastore.Entity(key=Key('Thing'))
         ...     datastore.put([entity])

       ``entity`` won't have a complete Key until the transaction is
       committed.

       Once you exit the transaction (or call ``commit()``), the
       automatically generated ID will be assigned to the entity::

         >>> with datastore.Transaction():
         ...     entity = datastore.Entity(key=Key('Thing'))
         ...     datastore.put([entity])
         ...     assert entity.key.is_partial  # There is no ID on this key.
         ...
         >>> assert not entity.key.is_partial  # There *is* an ID.

    If you don't want to use the context manager you can initialize a
    transaction manually::

      >>> transaction = datastore.Transaction()
      >>> transaction.begin()

      >>> entity = datastore.Entity(key=Key('Thing'))
      >>> transaction.put(entity)

      >>> if error:
      ...     transaction.rollback()
      ... else:
      ...     transaction.commit()

    :type dataset_id: string
    :param dataset_id: The ID of the dataset.

    :type connection: :class:`gcloud.datastore.connection.Connection`
    :param connection: The connection used to connect to datastore.

    :raises: :class:`ValueError` if either a connection or dataset ID
             are not set.
