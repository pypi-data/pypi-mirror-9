class BagOfWords(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    '''
    Transforms feature sets into the bag of words representation:

    1. Run k-means on the set of all points from all bags, to get codewords.
    2. Represent each bag by the count of points assigned to each codeword.

    This approach is common in computer vision and, when the number of codewords
    is tuned correctly, can provide a good single summary vector of the
    distribution of inputs for many types of learning tasks.

    It is often helpful to either take the square root of the output vectors
    or compare them with :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.chi2_kernel`, which
    have similar effects and both approximate a more realistic non-iid model
    [1]_.


    Parameters
    ----------
    kmeans : KMeans estimator
        Object to run k-means with; :class:`sklearn.cluster.KMeans` or
        :class:`sklearn.cluster.MiniBatchKMeans` are most likely.
        Compared to a standard clustering setup, you want a much higher
        ``n_clusters`` (depending on the size and dimensionality, between maybe
        tens and thousands), lowish ``max_iter`` (maybe 100; we don't care so
        much about the exact solution, just that it has a reasonable spread),
        and lower ``n_init`` (same reason). The object should not yet be fit;
        we'll copy it, not modify it.

    Attributes
    ----------
    `kmeans_fit_` : KMeans estimator
        A fit version of the `kmeans` parameter.
