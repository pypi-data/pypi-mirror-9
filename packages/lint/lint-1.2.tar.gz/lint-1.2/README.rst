Lint
====

Python script to automatically lint new reviews to gerrit. Designed to
be run from within Jenkins via the Gerrit Trigger plugin

Lint is a python package to assist with automatic code reviews. It
provides the following tools:

1. Get a list of files changed between the active gerrit branch and the
   specified gerrit review.
2. Lint the original files in the active gerrit branch.
3. Checkout the current review ID
4. Lint the changed files.
5. Analyze the results according to specified validators.
6. Post the results of the validation to gerrit via SSH (+1/-1 score
   assigned, including a message).

Lint uses the environmental variables set by Gerrit Trigger to do almost
all of the configuration. You can still use it via command-line (with
options!) for manual testing.

You can also add a checkers to validators, which are simple functions to
compare lint data that are passed to the validator.

Installation
------------

pip install git+https://github.com/astraw38/Lint

Usage
-----

For pylint, just use 'gpylinter.py'. It by default will use the
'Pylinter' plugin for .py files, as well as the default pylint
validators.

Lint provides the ability to plugin your own Linter or Validator
classes. All you need to do is run

.. code:: python

    LintFactory.register_linter(NewLinter()) 

or

.. code:: python

    ValidatorFactory.register_validator(NewValidator())

When you run 'run\_linters()' or 'run\_validators()', it'll pick them up
and use them. Your new Linters should derive from BaseLinter, and your
new Validators should derive from BaseValidator.

You can also customize the order of operations, or how comments/scores
are posted to gerrit. Just look at gpylinter as an example.
