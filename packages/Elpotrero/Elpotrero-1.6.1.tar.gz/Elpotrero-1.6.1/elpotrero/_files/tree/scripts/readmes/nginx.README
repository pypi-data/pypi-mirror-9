sometimes for some reason it seems as if nginx is just not picking up the gunicorn port, this can be because you did not load the nginx version with the necessary module.

Check to see if you installed nginx-core, or something like that.  nginx-core is stripped down and probably doesn't have what you need.  You might even need to download the module and recompile everything directly.
