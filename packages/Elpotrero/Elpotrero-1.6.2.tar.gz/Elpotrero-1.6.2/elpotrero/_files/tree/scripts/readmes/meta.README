virtualenv/.
    - these are files listing all the dependencies that I loaded up in the virtualenv library.  Try to keep these files up to date so you know cross platform what the site needs


media-generator/.
    - I THINK this is to keep track of where the media files are located.  It really is a meta file, because the information is used by the django instance to know where the files are located.
