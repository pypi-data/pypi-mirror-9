when developing apps like paypal that require a static address, use forwardhq to redirect the ip.

You can also use this if you simply want to make an app you are developing available to someone else or to develop for the ipad

I am using Forwardfile to configure the forwarding options in each site.

scripts/conf/forward/_build/Forwardfile

go to that directory then simply type in "forward"
