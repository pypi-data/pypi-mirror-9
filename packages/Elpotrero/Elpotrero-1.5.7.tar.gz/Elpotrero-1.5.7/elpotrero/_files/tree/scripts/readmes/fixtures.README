This command allows you to spit out the data for a fixture, you can also do this for the admin section, but I don't recommend it

python manage.py dumpdata appname  --indent 4 > initial_data.json

mv initial_data.json apps/appname/fixtures


when you want to load it up use:

python manage.py loaddata apps/appname/fixtures/initial_data.json
