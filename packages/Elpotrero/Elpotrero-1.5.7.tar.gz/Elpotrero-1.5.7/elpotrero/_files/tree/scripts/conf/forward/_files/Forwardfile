# set the port to forward
# technically, I want to set port to the "port" variable, but the problem is that this
# does not allow me to see the normal media files.
#
# media files served through djangomediagenerator go through, but media files served
# through nginx do not.  The reason for this is that if I am going through the django
# port, e.g. 8020, it will not check port 80 (the nginx port).  So we have to set it
# up so it goes through the nginx port (port 80)
#
#port: {{port}}
port: 80

# Set the host/vhost to forward
host: {{project}}.{{domain}}

# Set a static subdomain prefix to use
subdomain_prefix: {{project}}
