Elpotrero is a utility library that provides routines to do some basic yaml processing and string manipulations.

It also has a few basic functions which are helpful in using home made scripts

Finally, it contains a script that installs a basic django framework that contains all the scripts I need to maintain and keep such a framework running


Its' really meant for private use though, but if you find it helpful great!


Any questions or suggestion, feel free to let me know
