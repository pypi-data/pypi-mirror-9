Description: Elpotrero is a utility library that provides routines to do some basic yaml processing and string manipulations.
        
        It also has a few basic functions which are helpful in using home made scripts
        
        Finally, it contains a script that installs a basic django framework that contains all the scripts I need to maintain and keep such a framework running
        
        
        Its' really meant for private use though, but if you find it helpful great!
        
        
        Any questions or suggestion, feel free to let me know
