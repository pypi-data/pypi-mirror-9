# PROJECT_NAME is the name of your project
# USER_NAME_1 and USER_NAME_2 are the user names of the home directories we'll be installing into
# You want to change to port numbers.  the current port numbers are just an example of how to set it up
# ditto for the addresses (if you are running a different server for one of the installs)

# I think db_pasword is really just the mysql db password, but I am not 100% sure

# obviously, secret key has to be replaced with the correct secret key for the install!
