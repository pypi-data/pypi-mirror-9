This package has a simple calculator for working on vectors.  It will
take sums, differences, scalar products, dot products, and cross produsts
of vectors.  It includes three modules.  There is Vector, which contains
one class that defines vectors, and their methods.  The other two modules
are two different user interfaces.  VectorCalculator is a text based
user interface, and VectorCalculatorG is a graphical user interface.

In this version I have fixed a serious error with dot product.

I am using Python version 2.7.6
