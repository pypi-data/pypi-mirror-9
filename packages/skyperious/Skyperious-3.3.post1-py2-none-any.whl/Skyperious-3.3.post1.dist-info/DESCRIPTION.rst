You can open Skype SQLite databases and look at their contents:
- search across all messages and contacts
- browse chat history and export as HTML or spreadsheet, see chat statistics
- import contacts from a CSV file to your Skype contacts
- view any database table and export their data, fix database corruption
- change, add or delete data in any table
- execute direct SQL queries
and
- synchronize messages in two Skype databases: keep chat history up-to-date on
  different computers, or restore missing messages from older files into the
  current one

Note that wxPython for the graphical interface needs to be installed separately.
