PyEMMA IPython Notebooks
========================

The estimation notebook shows on how to estimate a Markov model from a pre
discretized molecular trajectory.

Under the directory 'analysis' you will find several notebooks showing the
usage of the PyEMMA API, to further analyze a already created Markov model.

To run these you will need PyEMMA and IPython with matplotlib.
