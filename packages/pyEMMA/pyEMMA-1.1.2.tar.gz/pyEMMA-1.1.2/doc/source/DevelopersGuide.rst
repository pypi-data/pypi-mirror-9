Dev Workflow
------------
Have a look at :doc:`DEVELOPMENT`.


Commit messages
---------------

Prepend a tag named [$top_api_package] to commit message, if the files changed
mainly belongs to that api package.

Eg.: ::

      pyemma.msm.api.analysis => [msm/analysis]

This has two opportunit√≠es:

1. You know only be looking at a commit message text which package has been
changed and these changes propably has an influence on your current work.

2. Merged commits from feature branches nicely reintegrate in the whole bunch of
commits from other features in the devel or master branch (may be filtered very
fast).

Else you would have to look at the diff introduced by each commit (or filter
with gitk, which is somehow painful).


Testing
-------
We use Pythons unittest module to write implement test cases for every algorithm.

To run all tests invoke: ::

    python setup.py test

or directly invoke nosetests in pyemma working copy: ::

    nosetests $PYEMMA_DIR

despite running all tests (which is encouraged if you are changing core features),
you can run individual tests by directly invoking them with python interpreter.
