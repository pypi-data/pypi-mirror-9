Initializing PH

We are solving a MINIMIZATION problem.

lambda= 0.0 ...run begins 3 scenarios
Initializing ef solver with options=['"mipgap=0.001"']
SolStatus=optimal
	...ends
Initial cost = 108879.328  for bL = 0.0
lambda= 0.0 ...run begins
Initializing ef solver with options=['"mipgap=0.001"']
SolStatus=optimal
	...ends
initial gap = 0.1602326682 

End of test; this is only a test.
