        django-sortable-listview
        ========================
        An extension of django's ListView that provides sorting.
        
        Features:
        - Works with django's built in pagination.
        - Contains templates & css for pagination and sort buttons (or just use the context_data and build your own).
        - Adds an arrow to show the sort direction on the active sort.
        - Knows what the next sort is (i.e. if you're already sorted by title in one direction, clicking on the title button/link again will sort it in the other direction).
        - Lets you specify default sort for your list (defaults to -id) and for each of the sortable fields.
        - Modifies the queryset, so your database does your sorting.
        - Maintains additional query strings (configurable)
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
            * Python (2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4)
            * Django (1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8)
        
        (Tested against the latest version of each e.g. currently Python 2.7.4 & Django 1.5.12)
        
        
        Install
        =======
        Using pip::
        
            pip install django-sortable-listview
        
        If you want to use the provided temaplates and CSS add ``'sortable_listview'`` to your INSTALLED_APPS in your django settings.
        
        To see how to include the css and templates in your application, look at the example project. The css is just standard bootstrap.
        
        
        Example Project
        ===============
        ![Screenshot of example project](/example_project/screenshot.png)
        
        To run the example project. First make sure django and django-sortable-listview are on your python path. For example, from inside a virtualenv::
        
            pip install django
            pip install django-sortable-listview
        
        Then from your cloned folder::
        
            cd example_project
            python manage.py runserver
        
        You should be able to see the example project at localhost:8000. A database is provided with some sample content. The username and password is admin/admin
        
        Development and Tests
        =====================
        
        For your development setup::
        
            pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
        
        To run the tests::
        
            tox
        
        You may not want to run the whole tox suite when you are doing development. 
        In this case, uncomment the extra lines in requirements-dev.txt, but please
        don't commit these changes. (Suggestions welcome on a better way to manage this)
