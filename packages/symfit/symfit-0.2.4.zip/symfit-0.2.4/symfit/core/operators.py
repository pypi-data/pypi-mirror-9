"""
Point 1:
For whatever reason, sympy overloaded <, <=, > and >= to be symbolic by default
but == and != are used for structural equality by default.
I find this inconsistent, and it does not allow this package to use the
beautiful syntax I want for constraints, e.g.

constraints = [
    x**3 - y == 0,
    y - 1 >= 0,
]

Importing this file overwrites the default behavior to be symbolic.

Point 2:
Make the sympy Epressions callable, which makes the whole project feel more
consistent.
