CUBRID Python Interface Unit Test
Author: Ray Yin
=====================================

Overview
========

This folder contains unit test cases for CUBRID Python interface 9.3.0
You could run the codes to test the basic functions introduced on https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CUBRID-Python/9.3.0   


Requirements
========

* Environment Setup
1) Install Python 2.x or Python 3.x
2) Download CUBRID Python driver 9.3.0 source and install it by using command 'python setup.py build & python setup.py install'
   or you can install the driver in other ways described on http://www.cubrid.org/wiki_apis/entry/cubrid-python-driver-installation-instructions
3) Install CUBRID 9.3.0 on either local machine or a remote server  
4) Start CUBRID service and 'demodb' database (demodb is installed by default)

* Testing Tools
1) Python - install unittest Module
2) Shell - used to run all the cases automatically, you could install shell on Linux, or install Linux-like environment (e.g Cywin) if using Windows OS  


Run Unit Tests & Read the Test Results
========

* Run all the tests 
1) You could use shell to test all the cases once, simply type "sh run_test.sh"
2) The test.result file would be then generated which contains all the test results
   you can find the number of tests, assertions, failures and errors for each test class

* Run the single test
1) You could use python command to run a single test individually, such as 'python test_cubrid.py'
2) The test result would be stored in the *.result file, such as: test_cubrid.result, test_CUBRIDdb.result
