Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `pickups` for
local development.

1. Fork_ the `pickups` repo on GitHub (`Howto Fork A Repo <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_).
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/pickup.git

3. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Now you can make your changes locally.

4. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass style and unit
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ tox

To get tox, just pip install it.

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

3. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
4. Follow the `Python Styleguide <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
   with the exception that lines can be up to ``120`` characters long.
5. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, and 3.4, and for PyPy.
   Check https://travis-ci.org/maiksensi/pickups
   under pull requests for active pull requests or run the ``tox`` command and
   make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
