Getting involved
################

Welcome to `django-rblog` community. This page is intended to help you find
places where you can contribute to this project.

*************
Documentation
*************

As you can see, the documentation you are reading right now is not the best
in the world, so if you mind to take a hand in this, that would be so helpful
for the project. Even if you only have used `django-rblog` for a short time
there is much to do:

* Correct spelling mistakes.
* Translate documentation to your local language.
* Add screenshots and text to cover worse parts of the documentation.
* Write your own sections to help others with the support.

*********
Templates
*********

The main lack of the project are the templates. At this moment `django-rblog`
is offering only one template but in a near future will be glad to increase
this. If you are using (or it's in your mind to use) `django-rblog` it will be
fantastic if you share your template with the world.
