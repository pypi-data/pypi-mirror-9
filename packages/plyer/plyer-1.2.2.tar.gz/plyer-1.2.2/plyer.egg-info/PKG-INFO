Description: Plyer
        ====
        
        Plyer is a platform-independent api to use features commonly found on various
        platforms, notably mobile ones, in Python.
        
        How
        ---
        
        Plyer tries not to reinvent the wheel, and will call for external libraries to
        implement the api in the easiest way, depending on the current platform.
        
        - on python-for-android, pyjnius is used
        - on kivy-ios, pyobjus is used
        - on windows/mac/linux, commonly found libraries and programs will be used
