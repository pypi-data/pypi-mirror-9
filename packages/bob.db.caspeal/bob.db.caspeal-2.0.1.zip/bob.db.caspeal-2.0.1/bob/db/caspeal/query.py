    model_ids
      If given (as a list of model id's or a single one), only the files belonging to the specified model id is returned.

    lightings
      One or several of the possible lightings (e.g. 'EU+00' or 'FM-45').
      If not specified, objects of all lightings will be returned.
      Note: this field is ignored for purpose 'enroll'.

    poses

      If not specified, objects of all expressions are returned.
      Note: this field is ignored for purpose 'enroll'.

    accessories
      One or several accessories from (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
      If not specified, objects of all accessories are returned.
      Note: this field is ignored for purpose 'enroll'.
