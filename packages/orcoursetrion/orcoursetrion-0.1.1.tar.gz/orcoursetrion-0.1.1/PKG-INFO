Description: Orcoursetrion (a.k.a. Automatic Course Provisioning X)
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        Automatic course provisioning for the edx-platform using github and
        zendesk.
        
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        To get started, clone the repository, and run ``pip install .`` or
        just install directory from github.com with ``pip install
        git+https://github.com/mitodl/orcoursetrion``.
        
        Once installed, create or acquire an `OAUTH2 token from github
        <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/>`_. That
        at least has the ``repo``, ``write:repo_hook``, and ``write:org``
        permissions.
        
        Add the environment variable ``ORC_GH_OAUTH2_TOKEN=<your token>``
        to your environment, and run ``orcoursetrion --help`` for available
        commands and actions.
        
        If you are adding an XML course, you will also need to define
        ``ORC_STAGING_GITRELOAD`` in your environment for where Web hooks
        should be sent for push events.
