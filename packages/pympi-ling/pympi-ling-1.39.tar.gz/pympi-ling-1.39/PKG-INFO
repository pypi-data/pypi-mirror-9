Description: Documentation as well as a detailed changelog can be found on:

        Note on python 3 compatibility: I have only tested it on python 3.4, it will
        probably work on everything newer then or equal to 3.3.
        
        Pympi is a package that allows you to interact with Elan[1] files and
        TextGrid[2] files. You can create, edit and convert both formats into
        eachother. It includes besides all the basic functions also functions for:
        - Calculating gaps and overlaps between speakers conform Heldner and Edlund's
          method[3] (Could be used for determining floor transfers).
        - Shift annotations in both directions (Could be used when due to an error all
          annotations are misaligned).
        - Import from CLAN's chat files.
        - Merge and or filter tiers (Could be used to combine hands in gesture coding)
        - Move tiers between elan files.
        - Etc.
        
        The development version can be found on github[4].
