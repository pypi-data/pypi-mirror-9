Estimation of gene expression based on RNA-Seq data
---------------------------------------------------

FPKEM is a tool for quantifying abundances of genes
in sequenced samples, which takes into account mappability
of sequencing reads and possible deviation of splicing patterns
from the provided transcriptoem annotation file.

This version requires Python 3 with a pysam package.
