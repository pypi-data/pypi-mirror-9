dwolla-python
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dwolla/dwolla-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dwolla/dwolla-python)

The new and improved Dwolla library based off of the Python `requests` client. `dwolla-python` includes support for all API endpoints, and is the new library officially supported by Dwolla.

## Version

2.0.6

## Installation

`dwolla-python` is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dwolla), and therefore can be installed automagically via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).

**The Python `requests` library is required for `dwolla-python` to operate. It is included as a dependency on this package if your environment does not already have it.**

*To install:*

```
pip install dwolla
```

*To add to `requirements.txt` and make this a permanent dependency of your package:*

```requirements.txt
YourApp
SomeLibrary==1.2.3
dwolla>=2.0.0
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quickstart

`dwolla-python` makes it easy for developers to hit the ground running with our API. Before attempting the following, you should ideally create [an application key and secret](https://www.dwolla.com/applications).

* Change settings in `constants.py` by editing the file, or on-the-fly by doing `from dwolla import constants`, `constants.some_setting = some_value`.
* `from dwolla import module` where `module` is either `accounts`, `checkouts`, `contacts`, `fundingsources`, `masspay`, `oauth`, `request`, or `transactions`, or `from dwolla import *` to import all.
* Use at will!

### Example; Partial Import

`dwolla-python` allows you to import only the modules you need. 

*For this example, we will get information about a Dwolla ID.*

```python
from dwolla import accounts

print accounts.basic('812-121-7199')
```

### Example; Complete Import

`dwolla-python` also allows you to import the entire library to access everything at once.

*For this example, we will get information about a Dwolla ID, as well as request 5.00 from that same ID.*

```python
from dwolla import *

# Get information about the ID

print accounts.basic('812-121-7199')

# Request $5.00 from that ID

print request.create('812-121-7199', 5.00)
```

### Configuration and Use

Whenever you change settings, they will only be partially applied. This means that settings in `constants.py` will remain until they are changed. 

#### Default Settings
```python
client_id = 'YOUR ID HERE'
client_secret = 'YOUR SECRET HERE'
pin = 1234

oauth_scope = 'Send|Transactions|Balance|Request|Contacts|AccountInfoFull|Funding|ManageAccount'
access_token = 'OAUTH TOKENS GO HERE'

# Hostnames, endpoints
production_host = 'https://www.dwolla.com/'
sandbox_host = 'https://uat.dwolla.com/'
default_postfix = 'oauth/rest'

# Client behavior
sandbox = True
debug = True
host = None
rest_timeout = 15
proxy = False
```

#### Proxies

`dwolla-python` also supports proxies. In order to set proxies, you must assign a python dictionary to the proxy constant in the following format:

```
proxy = {
    'http': 'http://someproxy:someport',
    'https': 'https://anotherproxy:anotherport'
}
```

#### Example

**`customsettings.py` contains the following example in more detail.**

```python
# Import everything from the dwolla package
from dwolla import *

# Configure the library (change these)
constants.sandbox=False

constants.client_id = "zbDwIC0dWCVU7cQtfvGwVwVjvxwQfjaTgkVi+FZOmKqPBzK5JG"
constants.client_secret = "ckmgwJz9h/fZ09unyXxpupCyrmAMe0bnUiMHF/0+SDaR9RHe99"
constants.access_token = "aK6DdCVlIsR1hKvTbp8VCwnvci8cwaTLlW9edtbHJVmKoopnoe"


# Example 1: Get basic information for a user via
# their Dwolla ID.

print accounts.basic('812-202-3784')
```

### Override Settings

For endpoints that take either an `access_token` or a `pin`, it is possible to pass in alternate tokens or pins into those functions.

#### Example; Create a MassPay job

##### Function prototype
```python
def create(fundssource, items, params=False, alternate_token=False, alternate_pin=False):
```

```python
from dwolla import masspay

myItems = {...}

masspay.create('Balance', myItems, alternate_token="My Alternate Token", alternate_pin=1234)
```

---

There are 9 quick-start files which will walk you through working with `dwolla-python`'s classes/endpoint groupings.

* `customsettings.py`: Instantiate library with custom settings.
* `accounts.py`: Retrieve account information, such as balance.
* `checkouts.py`: Offsite-gateway endpoints, server-to-server checkout example.
* `contacts.py`: Retrieve/sort through user contacts.
* `fundingsources.py`: Modify and get information with regards to funding sources.
* `masspay.py`: Create and retrieve jobs/data regarding MassPay jobs.
* `oauth.py`: Examples on retrieving OAuth access/refresh token pairs.
* `request.py`: Create and retrieve money requests/information regarding money requests.
* `transactions.py`: Send money, get transaction info by ID, etc.

## Structure

`dwolla-python` is a conglomerate of multiple modules; each module in the `dwolla/` directory is named after a the endpoints that it covers ([similar to Dwolla's developer documentation](https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/docs)).

### Endpoint Modules and Methods

Each endpoint module depends on `Rest()` in `rest.py` to fulfill `GET` and `POST` requests.

* `accounts.py`:
 * `basic()`: Retrieves basic account information
 * `full()`: Retrieve full account information
 * `balance()`: Get user balance
 * `nearby()`: Get nearby users
 * `autowithdrawalstatus()`: Get auto-withdrawal status
 * `toggleautowithdrawalstatus()`: Toggle auto-withdrawal
* `checkouts.py`:
 * `create()`: Creates a checkout session.
 * `get()`: Gets status of existing checkout session.
 * `complete()`: Completes a checkout session.
 * `verify()`: Verifies a checkout session.
* `contacts.py`:
 * `get()`: Retrieve a user's contacts.
 * `nearby()`: Get spots near a location.
* `fundingsources.py`:
 * `info()`: Retrieve information regarding a funding source via ID.
 * `get()`: List all funding sources.
 * `add()`: Add a funding source.
 * `verify()`: Verify a funding source.
 * `withdraw()`: Withdraw from Dwolla into funding source.

 * `create()`: Creates a MassPay job.
 * `getjob()`: Gets a MassPay job.
 * `getjobitems()`: Gets all items for a specific job.
 * `getitem()`: Gets an item from a specific job.
 * `listjobs()`: Lists all MassPay jobs.
* `oauth.py`:
 * `genauthurl()`: Generates OAuth permission link URL
 * `get()`: Retrieves OAuth + Refresh token pair from Dwolla servers.
 * `refresh()`: Retrieves OAuth + Refresh pair with refresh token.
* `request.py`:
 * `create()`: Request money from user.
 * `get()`: Lists all pending money requests.
 * `info()`: Retrieves info for a pending money request.
 * `cancel()`: Cancels a money request.
 * `fulfill()`: Fulfills a money request.
* `transactions.py`:
 * `send()`: Sends money
 * `refund()`: Refunds money
 * `get()`: Lists transactions for user
 * `info()`: Get information for transaction by ID.
 * `stats()`: Get transaction statistics for current user.

## Unit Testing

`dwolla-python` uses [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) for unit testing. Integration testing is planned sometime in the future.

To run the tests, install `dwolla-python` as per the aforementioned instructions and run:

```
cd location/of/the/library
pip install unittest
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

## README

In order for the library's README file to display nicely on PyPi, we must use the `*.rst` file format. When making changes to this README file, please [use this tool](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try/) to convert the `*.md` file to `*.rst`, and make sure to keep both files updated.

## Credits

This wrapper is based on [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/) for REST capability and uses [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) for unit testing and [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) for automagical build verification.

Version `2.x` initially written by [David Stancu](http://davidstancu.me) (david@dwolla.com).

Versions `1.x`:
The old wrapper is a forked extension of Thomas Hansen's 'dwolla-python' module.
