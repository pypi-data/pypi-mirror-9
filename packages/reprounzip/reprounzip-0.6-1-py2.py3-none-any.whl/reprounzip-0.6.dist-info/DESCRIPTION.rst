ReproZip
========

`ReproZip <http://vida-nyu.github.io/reprozip/>`__ is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible
experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator
in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a package
that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given
command on the author's computational environment (packing step).
A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).

This is the component responsible for the unpacking step on Linux distributions.
