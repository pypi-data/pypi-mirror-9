Description: Tweetcal
        ========
        
        Tweetcal converts a Twitter feed into .ics (calendar) format.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Install with ``pip install tweetcal``
        
        How to
        ------
        
        Tweetcal has two commands. The first converts a Twitter archive to
        ``ics``, the second saves recent tweets to ``ics``.
        
        Reading an archive
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Download your `Twitter
        archive <https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160-downloading-your-twitter-archive>`__
        and unzip it. Let's say it's in ``~/Downloads/archive/``. Run this
        command:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ tweetcal read-archive ~/Downloads/archive calendar-file.ics
        
        This will create ``calendar-file.ics``. Test it by opening in your
        favorite calendaring program.
        
        Saving recent tweets
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For this section, you'll need `Twitter OAuth
        credentials <https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens>`__.
        
        Save those tokens to a yaml or json file. Use the `sample format in the
        repo <sample-config.yaml>`__ as a guide. Let's say you've saved the file
        to ``~/tweetcal.yaml`` and your username is 'screen\_name1'. Once that's
        set up, run:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ tweetcal stream --config ~/tweetcal.yaml --user screen_name1
        
        Tweetcal leaves a note in ics files it creates to tell it where in an
        account's stream to start downloading. Because of this, you should only
        use a file created by Tweetcal with tweetcal-stream.
