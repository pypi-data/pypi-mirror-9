Description: The Python FinTech package
        ==========================
        
        This package contains all the functionality that is required to work with
        EBICS, SEPA and other financial technologies. The usage has been realised
        as simple as possible but also as flexible as necessary.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Obtain bank account statements (CAMT and MT940)
        - Create and submit SEPA credit transfers (pain.001)
        - Create and submit SEPA direct debits CORE, COR1, B2B (pain.008)
        - Mostly full SEPA support
        - Automatic calculation of the lead time based on holidays and cut-off times
        - Integrated mandate manager (beta)
        - Plausibility check of IBAN and BIC
        - Validation of payment orders against the SEPA Clearing Directory of the
          German Central Bank
        - Bankcode/Account to IBAN converter according to the rules of the German
          Central Bank
        - DATEV converter (KNE)
        
        The FinTech package provides you the possibility to manage all of your everyday
        commercial banking activities such as credit transfers, direct debits or the
        retrieval of bank account statements in a flexible and secure manner.
        
        All modules can be used free of charge. Only the unlicensed version of the
        EBICS module has few restrictions. The upload of SEPA documents is limited
        to a maximum of five transactions and bank account statements can not be
        retrieved for the last three days.
        
        EBICS example
        -------------
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
            
            import fintech
            fintech.register()
            from fintech.ebics import EbicsKeyRing, EbicsBank, EbicsUser, EbicsClient
            
            keyring = EbicsKeyRing(keys='~/mykeys', passphrase='mysecret')
            bank = EbicsBank(keyring=keyring, hostid='MYBANK', url='https://www.mybank.de/ebics')
            user = EbicsUser(keyring=keyring, partnerid='CUSTOMER123', userid='USER1')
            # Create new keys for this user
            user.create_keys(keyversion='A006', bitlength=2048)
            
            client = EbicsClient(bank, user)
            # Send the public electronic signature key to the bank.
            client.INI()
            # Send the public authentication and encryption keys to the bank.
            client.HIA()
            
            # Create an INI-letter which must be printed and sent to the bank.
            user.create_ini_letter(bankname='MyBank AG', path='~/ini_letter.pdf')
        
            # After the account has been activated the public bank keys
            # must be downloaded and checked for consistency.
            print client.HPB()
            
            # Finally the bank keys must be activated.
            bank.activate_keys()
            
            # Download MT940 bank account statements
            data = client.STA(
                start='2014-02-01',
                end='2014-02-07',
