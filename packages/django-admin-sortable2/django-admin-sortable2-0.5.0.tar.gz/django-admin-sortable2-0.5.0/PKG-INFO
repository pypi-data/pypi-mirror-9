Description: django-admin-sortable2
        ======================
        
        A replacement for django-admin-sortable using an unintrusive approach.
        
        This plugin is a generic drag-and-drop ordering module for sorting
        objects in the List, the Stacked- and the Tabular-Inlines Views in the
        Django Admin interface.
        
        This module offers simple mixin classes which enrich the functionality
        of any existing class derived from ``admin.ModelAdmin``,
        ``admin.StackedInline`` or ``admin.TabluarInline``.
        
        Thus it makes it very easy to integrate with existing models and their
        model admin interfaces. Existing models can continue to inherit from
        ``models.Model``. No special base class is required.
        
        News
        ----
        
        Version 0.5.0 changed its naming convention.
        
        Unfortunately, because both libraries django-admin-sortable and
        dkango-admin-sortable2, use the same package name: ``adminsortable``, it
        is rather difficult if not impossible to use them side-by-side in the
        same project during transition. It also means that all of my migration
        history has to be either rewritten or discarded, because the existing
        migrations reference ``adminsortable.SortableForeignKey``, which does
        not exist in this package.

        Why should You use it?
        ----------------------
        
        All available plugins which add functionality to make list views for the
        Django admin interface sortable, offer a base class to be used instead
        of ``models.Model``. This abstract base class then contains a hard coded
        position field, additional methods, and meta directives.
        
        This inhibits to create sortable abstract models.
        **django-admin-sortable2** does not have these restrictions.
