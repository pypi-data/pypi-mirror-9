Description: 
        `fmn <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fmn>`_ is a family of systems to manage
        end-user notifications triggered by
        `fedmsg, the Fedora FEDerated MESsage bus <http://fedmsg.com>`_.
        
        This module contains the set of "rules" fmn uses to process messages.
        
        There is a parental placeholder repo with some useful information you might
        want to read through, like an `overview
        <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fmn/#fedora-notifications>`_, a little
        `architecture diagram <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fmn/#architecture>`_,
        and some `development instructions
        <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fmn/#hacking>`_ to help you get set up and
        coding.
