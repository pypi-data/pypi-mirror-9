This is a simple webapp for presenting data as offered by `Salt's Redis
Returner`_ written in `Flask`_.

A static demo is available `here`_.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- a simple and responsive interface based on `purecss`_ (and their example
  `email layout`_ to be exact)
- three main views:
    * a function view showing all minions that ran a particular function (as
      shown on the screenshot)
    * a history view for looking at a minion's history with a specific function
    * a job view listing all minions which ran a specific job
- a customizable navbar, which links to function views
- searchpages for everything
- live updates for the function view using websockets and `Redis' Keyspace Notifications`_
- a collapsible representation of raw job data using the awesome `renderjson`_

Running it from PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just install it using ``pip install saltobserver``. As always, it is
recommended to do so in a virtualenv. After that, the command
``run_saltobserver`` will be available within this virtualenv. If you want to
use non-default settings (at least look at the `defaults`_) prefix the command
with ``export SALTOBSERVER_SETTINGS=/path/to/config``. Other than that, you may
pass gunicorn options to the ``run_saltobserver`` command, they will be passed
on so that you can configure gunicorn for use with a proxy server.

.. _`defaults`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analogbyte/saltobserver/master/saltobserver/config.py

A typical deployment could use this command with supervisord:

::

  $ export SALTOBSERVER_SETTINGS=/home/saltobserver/config.cfg run_saltobserver -u saltobserver --bind unix:/var/run/saltobserver/socket

Running it from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your minions return their data to some Redis instance, it is as
simple as cloning this repo running ``scripts/run_saltobserver`` (and putting
that behind a reverse proxy, if needed). This uses `Gunicorn`_, which is pretty
flexible and can be configured for pretty much any setup.

.. _`Gunicorn`: http://gunicorn.org/

Note that your Redis instance has to have a version greater than v2.8.0
for the live updates to work.

Also look at the configuration in ``saltobserver/config.py``.
