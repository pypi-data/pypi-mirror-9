About
-----

Small library which tries to simplify integration of Haystack with Django REST Framework.
Contains a Generic ViewSet, a Serializer and a couple of Filters in order to make search as
painless as possible.

Supported Python and Django versions
------------------------------------

Tested with the following configurations:

    - Python 2.6
        - Django 1.5 and 1.6
    - Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4
        - Django 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7

.. note::

    Beginning with `geopy` v1.0, Python 2.6 support was dropped. If you are using Python 2.6 you must
    install `geopy` v0.99.
    (If you are installing from `pip`, this should happen automatically.)
