        ============
        
        Information about the AnyBlok project.
        
        Project Homepage
        ----------------
        
        AnyBlok is hosted on `Bitbucket <http://bitbucket.org>`_ - the main project
        page is at https://bitbucket.org/jssuzanne/anyblok or 
        http://code.anyblok.org. Source code is tracked here
        using `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com>`_.
        
        Releases and project status are available on Pypi at 
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anyblok.
        
        The most recent published version of this documentation should be at
        http://doc.anyblok.org.
        
        The latest stable documentation is for the release 0.1.0
        at http://docs.anyblok.org/0.1.1
        
        Project Status
        --------------
        
        AnyBlok is currently in beta status and is expected to be fairly
        stable.   Users should take care to report bugs and missing features on an as-needed
        basis.  It should be expected that the development version may be required
        for proper implementation of recently repaired issues in between releases;
        the latest master is always available at http://code.anyblok.org/get/default.tar.gz.
        or http://code.anyblok.org/get/default.zip
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install released versions of AnyBlok from the Python package index with 
        `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ or a similar tool::
        
            pip install anyblok
        
        Installation via source distribution is via the ``setup.py`` script::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Installation will add the ``anyblok`` commands to the environment.
        
        Unit Test
        ---------
        
        Run the test with ``nose``::
        
            pip install nose
            nosetests anyblok/tests anyblok/bloks/anyblok_core/tests 
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        AnyBlok works with **Python 3.2** and later. The install process will 
        ensure that `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_, 
        `Alembic <http://alembic.readthedocs.org/>`_ are installed, in addition to 
        other dependencies.  AnyBlok will work with SQLAlchemy as of version **0.9.8**. 
        AnyBlok will work with Alembic as of version **0.7.3**.
        The latest version of them is strongly recommended.
