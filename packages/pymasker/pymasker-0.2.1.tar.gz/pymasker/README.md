# pymasker

Pymasker is a python package to generate various masks from the Landsat 8 Quality Assessment band and MODIS land products.

## Installation

The package can be shipped to your computer using pip.

	pip install pymasker

Or just install it with the source code.

	python setup.py install

This package depends on [**numpy**](http://www.numpy.org/). If you want to load the band file directly, [**GDAL**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/) is also in need.
