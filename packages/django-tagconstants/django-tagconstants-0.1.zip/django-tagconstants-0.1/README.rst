django-tagconstants
===================

Define constants in your settings file, that are then made available in
your templates.

Installation
============

From the command line:

::

    pip install django-tagconstants

Add tagconstants to your installed apps:

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'tagconstants',
        ...
    )

Create a ``TAG_CONSTANTS`` dictionary in your ``settings.py`` file:

.. code:: python

    TAG_CONSTANTS = {}

Usage
=====

For security purposes, ``tagconstants`` is designed so that you create a
whitelist of variables to make available in your templates. For more
information see the **Design and Security** section.

To use a constant in your templates, first add the constant to your
``TAG_CONSTANTS`` setting:

.. code:: python

    TAG_CONSTANTS = {
        'CONSTANT': 'SOME STRING',
    }

Then in your templates, you can recall these constants with the
``{% constant ... %}`` template tag:

.. code:: html

    {% load tagconstants %}

    {% constant "CONSTANT" %}
        {# renders to 'SOME STRING' #}

    {% constant "CONSTANT" as "variable_name" %}
        {# loads the template variable variable_name="SOME STRING" #}
        {# into the template context #}
