XCSoar python package
  The XCSoar python package contains a wrapper for compiling the xcsoar python
  module.

  Import the ``xcsoar`` package to take advantage of the module. See the
  source code and the test_xcsoar.py script in the
  ``xcsoar.submodule/python/test/`` directory.


Installation
------------

You can install the XCSoar tools like any other python script by calling
``python setup.py install``. It will automatically compile the tools and
install them to an appropriate location.

You will most likely need to install a few of XCSoar's build dependencies.
On a standard Ubuntu machine calling ``apt-get install make
libcurl4-openssl-dev`` should get you started. Please read the XCSoar
documentation if there are more libraries missing.
