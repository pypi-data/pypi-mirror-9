*python-pptx* is a Python library for creating and updating PowerPoint (.pptx)
files.

A typical use would be generating a customized PowerPoint presentation from
database content, downloadble by clicking a link in a web application. Several
developers have used it to automate production of presentation-ready
engineering status reports based on information held in their work management
system. It could also be used for making bulk updates to a library of
presentations or simply to automate the production of a slide or two that would
be tedious to get right by hand.
