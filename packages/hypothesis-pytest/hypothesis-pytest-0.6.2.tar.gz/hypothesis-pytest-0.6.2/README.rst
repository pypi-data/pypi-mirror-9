This package adds some niceties for using `Hypothesis <https://github.com/DRMacIver/hypothesis>`_ based tests
with pytest. It's not necessary to make the two work together, but is designed to improve the experience. It's
mostly concerned with hooking into pytest's reporting mechanism to give you better information about what
Hypothesis is doing with your tests.
