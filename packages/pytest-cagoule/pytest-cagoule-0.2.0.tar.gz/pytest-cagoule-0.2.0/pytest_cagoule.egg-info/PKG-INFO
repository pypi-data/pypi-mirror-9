Description: pytest-cagoule
        ==============
        
        **pytest-cagoule** is a pytest plugin to find which tests interact with the
        code you've just changed.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Collect coverage information using ``--cagoule-capture``
        
        ::
        
            py.test --cagoule-capture
        
        Then, to run the subset of tests that touch a particular file, use
        ``cagoule-select=<filename>[:line number]``, e.g.
        
        ::
        
            py.test --cagoule-select=path/to/file.py
        
        If you are using ``git``, cagoule can find the files and lines that have changes
        in the current working directory::
        
            py.test --diff
        
        or for any other diff spec that git can parse, using ``--diff=<spec>``, e.g.
        
        ::
        
            py.test --diff=head~1..head
        
        
        You probably want to configure your CI server to handle capturing.
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Install **pytest-cagoule** using ``pip``::
        
            pip install pytest-cagoule
        
        
        Caveats
        ^^^^^^^
        
        Only lines executed *during individual test runs* are captured. This often
        excludes module level code, which is executed at *import* time, before the test
        starts.  Also, tests are of course registered against the code as it was when
        data was captured, so if using ``--diff``, no new tests will be included.
