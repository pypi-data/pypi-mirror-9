A Python paste bin.

Serve it up from librarypaste.py or install it and run the librarypaste command. Right now it saves to `cwd`/repo, but hopefully that will change/be improved soon.

Also take a look at http://bitbucket.org/chmullig/librarypaste-tools and http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lpaste for some useful tools to make uploading/pasting easier.
