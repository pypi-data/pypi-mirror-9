            * system information submodule
            * file operations wrappers and classes

        Installation Note
        -----------------
        The installation of this module does not ensure all its dependencies are met.
        As an example sqlalchemy is required for part of the ``core.config`` module
        however that specific module is only required for the admin interface and
        master.
