Description: FluidSim is the numerically oriented package of the `FluidDyn project
        <http://pythonhosted.org/fluiddyn>`__.  The project is still in a
        testing stage so it is still pretty unstable and many of its planned
        features have not yet been implemented.
        
        It has first been developed by `Pierre Augier
        <http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/people/Pierre.Augier/>`_ (CNRS
        researcher at `LEGI <http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr>`_, Grenoble) at
        KTH (Stockholm) as a numerical code to solve fluid equations in a
        periodic two-dimensional space with pseudo-spectral methods.
        
        *Key words and ambitions*: fluid dynamics research with Python (2.7 or
        >= 3.3); modular, object-oriented, collaborative, tested and
        documented, free and open-source software.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can get the source code from `Bitbucket
        <https://bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/fluidsim>`__ or from `the Python
        Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluidsim/>`__.
        
        The development mode is often useful. From the root directory::
        
          sudo python setup.py develop
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        From the root directory::
        
          make tests
        
        Or, from the root directory or from any of the "test" directories::
        
          python -m unittest discover
