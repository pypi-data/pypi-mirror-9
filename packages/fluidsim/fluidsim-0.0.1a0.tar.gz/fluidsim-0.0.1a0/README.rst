FluidSim

*Framework for studying fluid dynamics by numerical simulation.*

`Package Documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/fluidsim>`__

FluidSim is the numerically oriented package of the `FluidDyn project
<http://pythonhosted.org/fluiddyn>`__.  The project is still in a
testing stage so it is still pretty unstable and many of its planned
features have not yet been implemented.

It has first been developed by `Pierre Augier
<http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/people/Pierre.Augier/>`_ (CNRS
researcher at `LEGI <http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr>`_, Grenoble) at
KTH (Stockholm) as a numerical code to solve fluid equations in a
periodic two-dimensional space with pseudo-spectral methods.

*Key words and ambitions*: fluid dynamics research with Python (2.7 or
>= 3.3); modular, object-oriented, collaborative, tested and
documented, free and open-source software.

Installation
------------

You can get the source code from `Bitbucket
<https://bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/fluidsim>`__ or from `the Python
Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluidsim/>`__.

The development mode is often useful. From the root directory::

  sudo python setup.py develop

Tests
-----

From the root directory::

  make tests

Or, from the root directory or from any of the "test" directories::

  python -m unittest discover
