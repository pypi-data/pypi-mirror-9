Description: Numberjack is a modelling package written in Python for
        constraint programming and combinatorial optimization. Python benefits from a
        large and active programming community, Numberjack is therefore a perfect tool
        to embed CP technology into larger applications. It is designed to support a
        number of efficient underlying C/C++ solvers seamlessly and efficiently.
