Usage: 

*/ Compilation :
1- First add the folder Mistral-2.0/fz to the PATH. 
2- To build (from within the folder Mistral-2.0):

$ make

This will generate the executable file fzn-mistral in the 'bin' folder.

*/ You can test a flatzinc instance with :

$ bin/fzn-mistral data/zinc/zebra.fzn 

*/ Notes:

1- fzn-mistral does not use parallel threads so the option -p has no use (yet). 
2- Search annotations are not (yet) supported. So with or without the option -f, the solver will ignore them.

As expected, the 'globals' directory contains the solver-specific definitions of the global constraints in the MiniZinc library. Mistral-2.0 usues a specific definition of all_different_int.
