        CPyMad_ is a Cython_ binding to MAD-X_.
        
        MAD-X is a software package to simulate particle accelerators and is used
        at CERN and all around the world. It has its own proprietary scripting
        language and is usually launched from the command line.

        Disclaimer
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This is a heavily modified fork of the cern-cpymad_ package. The fork is
        not authored or maintained by CERN members.
        
        CPyMAD links against an unofficial build of MAD-X that is not supported by
        CERN, i.e. in case of problems you will not get help there.

        Dependencies
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To build MAD-X and CPyMAD from source you will need
        
        - CMake_
        - python>=2.7
        - C / Fortran compilers.
        
        Furthermore, CPyMAD depends on the following python packages:
        
        - setuptools_
        - Cython_
        - NumPy_
        - PyYAML_
        
        The python packages can be installed using pip_.

        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        The ``Madx`` class provides a basic binding to the MAD-X interpreter:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from cpymad.madx import Madx
        
            # create a new interpreter instance:
            # the optional 'command_log' parameter can be used to store MAD-X
            # command history.
            madx = Madx(command_log="log.madx")
        
            # you execute arbitrary textual MAD-X commands:
            madx.input('call, file="input_file.madx";')
        
            # there is a more convenient syntax available which does the same:
            madx.command.call(file="input_file.madx")
        
            # And for some commands there exist direct shortcuts:
            madx.call('/path/to/some/input_file.madx')
        
            # Calculate TWISS parameters:
            twiss = madx.twiss(sequence='LEBT',
                               betx=0.1, bety=0.1,
                               alfx=0.1, alfy=0.1)
        
            # Your own analysis below:
            from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
            plt.plot(twiss['s'], twiss['betx'])
            plt.show()
        
        There is also a ``Model`` class which encapsulates more metadata for complex
        accelerator machines. If you have ready-to-use model definitions on your
        filesystem, models can be instanciated and used as follows:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from cpymad.model import Model
        
            model = Model.load('/path/to/model/definition.cpymad.yml')
        
            for sequence in model.sequences.values():
                twiss = sequence.twiss()
        
        See http://hibtc.github.io/cpymad for further documentation.
        
        
        Contributing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Try to be consistent with the PEP8_ guidelines. Add `unit tests`_ for all
        non-trivial functionality. `Dependency injection`_ is a great pattern to
        keep modules testable.
        
        Commits should be reversible, independent units if possible. Use descriptive
        titles and also add an explaining commit message unless the modification is
        trivial. See also: `A Note About Git Commit Messages`_.

        Tests
        ~~~~~
        
        Currently, tests run on:
        
        - The `Travis CI`_ service is mainly used to check that the unit tests for
          pymad itself execute on several python versions. Python{2.7,3.3} are
          supported. The tests are executed on any update of an upstream branch.
          The Travis builds use a unofficial precompiled libmadx-dev_ package to
          avoid having to rebuild the entire MAD-X library on each invocation.

        - convert IOError to RemoteProcessCrashed, which can occur on transmission
          if the remote process is already down
        - convert ValueError to RemoteProcessClosed, which can occur on transmission
          if the remote process was already closed
        
        
        0.10.0 Fork
        ===========
        Date: 09.01.2015
        
        This is the first independent version released for the `HIT cpymad fork`_.
        The changes on the public API are so heavy, that this is basically a new
        library.
        
        - rename package from ``cern.cpymad`` to ``cpymad``
        - remove LHC models from repository
        - redesign API to make more use of OOP (no stable API yet!)
        - removed some obsolete / unused modules
        
        .. _HIT cpymad fork: https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad
        
        
        0.9
        ===
        Date: 17.11.2014
        
        - don't link against numpy anymore (this makes distribution of prebuilt
          binaries on windows actually useful)
        - add MAD-X license notice (required to distribute binaries)
        - setup.py doesn't require setuptools to be pre-installed anymore (if
          internet is available)
        - some doc-fixes
        - convert cpymad._couch to a simple module (was a single file package)
        - use ``logging`` through-out the project
        - alow logger to be specified as model/madx constructor argument
        - multi-column access, e.g.: ``table.columns['betx','bety']``
        - move tests one folder level up
        
        
        0.8
        ===
        Date: 30.06.2014
        
        - isolate cpymad: remove jpymad backend, remove pymad base
        - bootstrap the dependency on numpy
        - remove custom MAD-X path discovery during setup. You should use
          *--madxdir* if the library is not installed in a system location.
        - add function ``libmadx.is_expanded``
        - add function ``libmadx.chdir``
        - handle MAD-X table columns with integer arrays
        - make ``madx.command`` more powerful (allows ``**kwargs`` and attribute
          access)
        - use inherited pipes for IPC with remote MAD-X processes (allows to
          forward stdin/stdout separately)
        - close connection to remote process on finalization of ``LibMadxClient``
        - remove MAD-X command checks, ``recursive_history`` and filename
          completion
        - fix name clash
        - fix some bugs
        - rename convenience constructors to ``cern.cpymad.load_model`` and
          ``cern.cpymad.start_madx`` due to name clash with module names
        
        
        0.7
        ===
        Date: 16.04.2014
        
        - close handles in remote process properly on all supported python versions
        - rewrite ``libmadx.get_table`` functionality
        - madx functions that return tables now return proxy objects instead. For
          backward compatibility these can be iterated to allow unpacking into a tuple
        - the returned table columns is now a proxy object as well and not ``TfsTable``
        - remove ``retdict`` parameter
        - move some cpymad specific functionality into the cpymad package
        - add libmadx/madx functions to access list of elements in a sequence
        
        
        0.6
        ===
        Date: 17.03.2014
        
        - raise exception and don't hang up anymore, if libmadx process crashes
        - on python>=3.4, close handles in remote process properly
        - let every 'Madx' instance have an independent copy of the madx library.
          this makes the madx module much more useful. previously, this was only
          true for instances of 'cpymad.model'.
        - restrict to only one cython module that links to libmadx. (allows static
          linking which is advantageous on windows!)
        - use YAML model files instead of JSON
        - make 'madx' a submodule of 'cpymad'
        - fix test exit status
        
        
        0.5
        ===
        Date: 21.01.2014
        
        - migrate to setuptools from distutils
        - python3 support
        - add continuous integration with Travis
        - proper setup.py and MANIFEST.in to be used with PyPI
        - rename package to 'cern-pymad'
        - allow to build from PyPI without having cython
