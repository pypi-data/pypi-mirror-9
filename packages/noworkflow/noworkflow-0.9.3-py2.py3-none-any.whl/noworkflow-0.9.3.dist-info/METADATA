The noWorkflow project aims at allowing scientists to benefit from
provenance data analysis even when they don't use a workflow system.
Also, the goal is to allow them to avoid using naming conventions to
store files originated in previous executions. Currently, when this is
not done, the result and intermediate files are overwritten by every new
execution of the pipeline.

noWorkflow was developed in Python and it currently is able to capture
provenance of Python scripts using Software Engineering techniques such
as abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis, reflection, and profiling, to
collect provenance without the need of a version control system or any
other environment.

Installing and using noWorkflow is simple and easy. Please check our
installation and basic usage guidelines below.

Quick Installation
------------------

To install noWorkflow, you should follow these basic instructions:

If you have pip, just run:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install noworkflow[all]

This installs noWorkflow, PyPosAST, Flask, IPython Notebook and PySWIP.
The only requirement for running noWorkflow is PyPosAST. The other
libraries are only used for provenance analysis.

If you only want to install noWorkflow and PyPosAST, please do:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install noworkflow

If you do not have pip, but already have Git (to clone our repository)
and Python:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:JoaoFelipe/pyposast.git
    $ cd pyposast
    $ ./setup.py install
    $ cd ..
    $ git clone git@github.com:gems-uff/noworkflow.git
    $ cd noworkflow/capture
    $ ./setup.py install

This installs noWorkflow on your system.

Basic Usage
-----------

noWorkflow is transparent in the sense that it requires neither changes
to the script, nor any laborious configuration. Run

.. code:: bash

    now --help

to learn the usage options.

To run noWorkflow with a script called *simulation.py* with input data
*data1.dat* and *data2.dat*, you should run

.. code:: bash

    now run -v simulation.py data1.dat data2.dat

The *-v* option turns the verbose mode on, so that noWorkflow gives you
feedback on the steps taken by the tool. The output, in this case, is
similar to what follows.

.. code:: bash

    $ now run -v simulation.py data1.dat data2.dat
    [now] removing noWorkflow boilerplate
    [now] setting up local provenance store
    [now] collecting definition provenance
    [now]   registering user-defined functions
    [now] collecting deployment provenance
    [now]   registering environment attributes
    [now]   searching for module dependencies
    [now]   registering provenance from 703 modules
    [now] collecting execution provenance
    [now]   executing the script
    [now] the execution of trial 1 finished successfully

Each new run produces a different trial that will be stored with a
sequential identification number in the relational database.

Verifying the module dependencies is a time consuming step, and
scientists can bypass this step by using the *-b* flag if they know that
no library or source code has changed. The current trial then inherits
the module dependencies of the previous one.

It is possible to collect more information than what is collected by
default, such as variable usages and dependencias. To perform a dynamic
program slicing and capture those information, just run

.. code:: bash

    now run -e Tracer simulation.py data1.dat data2.dat

To list all trials, just run

.. code:: bash

    now list

Assuming we run the experiment again and then run , the output would be
as follows.

.. code:: bash

    $ now list
    [now] trials available in the provenance store:
      Trial 1: simulation.py data1.dat data2.dat
             with code hash aa49daae4ae8084af3602db436e895f08f14aba8
             ran from 2014-03-04 13:10:34.595995 to 2014-03-04 13:11:33.793083
      Trial 2: simulation.py data1.dat data2.dat
             with code hash aa49daae4ae8084af3602db436e895f08f14aba8
             ran from 2014-03-04 17:59:02.917920 to 2014-03-04 18:00:10.383637

To look at details of an specific trial, use

.. code:: bash

    now show

This command has several options, such as *-m* to show module
dependencies; *-d* to show function definitions; *-e* to show the
environment context; *-a* to show function activations; and *-f* to show
file accesses.

Running

.. code:: bash

    now show -a 1

would show details of trial 1. Notice that the function name is preceded
by the line number where the call was activated.

.. code:: bash

    $ now show -a 1
    [now] trial information:
      Id: 1
      Inherited Id: None
      Script: simulation.py
      Code hash: aa49daae4ae8084af3602db436e895f08f14aba8
      Start: 2014-03-04 13:10:34.595995
      Finish: 2014-03-04 13:11:33.793083
    [now] this trial has the following function activation graph:
      42: run_simulation (2014-03-04 13:11:30.969055 -
                                    2014-03-04 13:11:32.978796)
          Arguments: data_b = 'data2.dat', data_a = 'data1.dat'
          Globals: wait = 2
          Return value: [['0.0', '0.6'], ['1.0', '0.0'], ['1.0', '0.0'],
          ...

To restore files used by trial 1, run

.. code:: bash

    $ now checkout -l -i 1

By default, the checkout command only restores the script used for the
trial ("simulation.py"), even when it has imports and read files as
input. Use the option "-l" to restore imported modules and the option
"-i" to restore input files. The checkout command track the evolution
history. By default, subsequent trials are based on the previous Trial
(e.g. Trial 2 is based on Trial 1). When you checkout a Trial, the next
Trial will be based on the checked out Trial (e.g. Trial 3 based on
Trial 1).

The remaining options of noWorkflow are *diff*, *export* and *vis*. The
*diff* option compares two trials, and the *export* option exports
provenance data of a given trial to Prolog facts, so inference queries
can be run over the database.

The vis option starts a visualization tool that allows interactive
analysis:

.. code:: bash

    $ now vis -b

The visualization tool shows the evolotion history, the trial
information, an activation graph. It is also possible to compare
different trials in the visualization tool.

The visualization tool requires Flask to be installed. To install Flask,
you can run

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install flask

IPython Interface
-----------------

Another way to run, visualize, and query trials is to use IPython
notebook. To install IPython notebook, you can run

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install ipython[all]

Then, to run ipython notebook, go to the project directory and execute:

.. code:: bash

    $ ipython notebook

It will start a local webserver where you can create notebooks and run
python code.

Before loading anything related to noworkflow on a notebook, you must
initialize it:

.. code:: python

    In  [1]: %load_ext noworkflow
        ...: import noworkflow.now.ipython as nip

It is equivalent to:

.. code:: python

    In  [1]: %load_ext noworkflow
        ...: nip = %now_ip

After that, you can either run a new trial or load an existing object
(History,Trial,Diff).

There are two ways to run a new trial: 1- Load an external file

.. code:: python

    In  [1]: arg = 6

    In  [2]: trial = %now script1.py $arg
        ...: trial
    Out [2]: <Trial 5> # Loads the trial object represented as a graph

2- Load the code inside a cell

.. code:: python

    In  [3]: %%now --name script2 --out=out_var $arg
        ...: import sys
        ...: l = range(sys.argv[1])
        ...: c = sum(l)
        ...: print(c)
             6
    Out [3]: <Trial 6> # Loads the trial object represented as a graph

    In  [4]: out_var
    Out [4]: "6\n"

Both modes supports all the ``now run`` parameters It is worth noticing
that the noworkflow cannot access ipython variables and ipython cannot
access noworkflow variables. To workaround this limitation, it is
necessary to pass arguments to the program and parse the output. Pickle
may be a good solution for serializing complex objects

Loading existing trials, histories and diffs:

.. code:: python

    In  [5]: trial = nip.Trial(2) # Loads trial with Id = 2
        ...: trial # Shows trial graph
    Out [5]: <Trial 2>

    In  [6]: history = nip.History() # Loads history
        ...: history # Shows history graph
    Out [6]: <History>

    In  [7]: diff = nip.Diff(1, 2) # Loads diff between trial 1 and 2
        ...: diff # Shows diff graph
    Out [7]: <Diff 1 2>

There are attributes on those objects to change the graph visualization,
width, height and filter values. Please, check the documentation by
running the following code on ipython notebook

.. code:: python

    In  [8]: trial?

    In  [9]: history?

It is also possible to run prolog queries on IPython notebook. To do so,
you will need to install SWI-Prolog with shared libraries and the pyswip
module.

You can install pyswip module with the command:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pyswip-alt

Check how to install SWI-Prolog with shared libraries at
https://github.com/yuce/pyswip/blob/master/INSTALL

You can install pyswip

To query a specific trial, you can do:

.. code:: python

    In  [10]: result = trial.query("activation(_, 550, X, _, _, _)")
        ...: next(result) # The result is a generator
    Out [10]: {'X': 'range'}

To check the existing rules, please do:

.. code:: python

    In  [11]: trial.prolog_rules()
    Out [11]: [...]

Finally, it is possible to run the CLI commands inside ipython notebook:

.. code:: python

    In  [12]: !now export ${trial.id}
    Out [12]: %
         ...: % FACT: activation(trial_id, id, name, start, finish, caller_activation_id).
         ...: %
         ...: ...
