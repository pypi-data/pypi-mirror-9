.. index:: API, application programmer interface

================================
Application programmer interface
================================

Overview
========

Additionally to the command line tool ``cutplace`` all functions are available
as Python API. For a complete reference about all public classes and functions,
visit <http://roskakori.github.com/cutplace/api/>.

This chapter describes how to perform a basic validation of a simple CSV file
containing data about some customers. It also explains how to extend
cutplace's fields formats and checks.

.. warning::

  Due the major rework of the API with version 0.8.0 this chapter is currently
  outdated and several code examples will not work. Possibly the online
  version at http://cutplace.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html is already
  fixed.


Set up logging
==============

Cutplace uses Python's standard logging module. This provides a familiar and
powerful way to watch what cutplace is doing. However, it also requires to
setup the logging properly in order to gain most from it.

For a quick start, set up your application's log messages to go to the console
and show only information, warning and errors, but no debug messages:

>>> import logging
>>> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

Next trim cutplace's logging to show only warnings and errors as you might not
be particularly interested in whatever it is cutplace does during a
validation:

>>> logging.getLogger("cutplace").setLevel(logging.WARNING)

This should be enough to get you going. To learn more about logging, take a
look at `logging chapter <http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html>`_ of
the Python library documentation.

Basic usage
===========

Reading an CID
--------------

The class
`interface.InterfaceControlDocument <api/cutplace.interface.InterfaceControlDocument-class.html>`_
represents an CID. In case you have an CID stored in a file and want to read
it, use:

>>> import os.path
>>> from cutplace import interface
>>>
>>> # Compute the path of a test file in a system independent manner,
>>> # assuming that the current folder is "docs".
>>> cid_path = os.path.join(os.pardir, "tests", "input", "icds", "customers.csv")
>>> icd = interface.Cid(cid_path)
>>> icd.fieldNames
['branch_id', 'customer_id', 'first_name', 'surname', 'gender', 'date_of_birth']

This is the easiest way to describe an interface. The resulting document is
human readable even for non coders and quite simple to edit and maintain. It
also keeps declaration and validation in separate files.


Validating data
---------------

.. WARNING::
  The functions described in this section might still change slightly
  in later versions and consequently require you to update your own code.

Now that we know how our data are supposed to look, we can validate and optionally
process them using
`interface.validatedRows() <file:///Users/agi/workspace/cutplace/build/site/api/cutplace.interface-module.html#validatedRows>`_.
This is a simple generator function that returns all data rows. If you are
familiar with Python's ``csv.reader()``, you already know how to use it.

Here is a trivial example that reads all rows from a valid CSV file:

>>> validCsvPath = os.path.join(os.pardir, "tests", "input", "valid_customers.csv")
>>> for row in interface.validatedRows(icd, validCsvPath):
...   pass # We could also do something useful with the data in ``row`` here.

In this case we only validate the data, but we could easily extend the loop
body to process them in any meaningful such a inserting them in a database.

Now what happens if the data do not conform with the interface? Let's take a
look at it:

>>> brokenCsvPath = os.path.join(os.pardir, "tests", "input", "broken_customers.csv")
>>> for row in interface.validatedRows(icd, brokenCsvPath):
...   pass
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
FieldValueError: broken_customers.csv (R4C1): field 'branch_id' must match format: value '12345' must match regular expression: '38\\d\\d\\d'

Apparently the first broken data item causes the reading to stop with an
``Exception``. In many cases this is what you want.

Sometimes however the requirements for an application will state that all
valid data should be processed and invalid data should be put aside for
further examination, for example by writing them to a log file. This is
easy to do by setting the optional parameter ``errors="yield"``. With this
enabled, the generator always returns a value even for broken rows. The difference
however is that broken rows do not result in a list of values but in a result
of type ``CutplaceError``. It is up to you to detect this and process the different kinds
of results properly.

Here is an example the prints any data related errors detected during validation:

>>> from cutplace import tools
>>> brokenCsvPath = os.path.join(os.pardir, "tests", "input", "broken_customers.csv")
>>> for rowOrError in interface.validatedRows(icd, brokenCsvPath, errors="yield"):
...     if isinstance(rowOrError, tools.ErrorInfo):
...         if isinstance(rowOrError.error, tools.CutplaceError):
...             # Print data related error details and move on.
...             print rowOrError.error
...         else:
...             # Let other, more severe errors terminate the validation.
...             rowOrError.reraise()
...     else:
...         pass # We could also do something useful with the data in ``row`` here.
broken_customers.csv (R4C1): field 'branch_id' must match format: value '12345' must match regular expression: '38\\d\\d\\d'
broken_customers.csv (R5C2): field 'customer_id' must match format: value must be an integer number: 'XX'
broken_customers.csv (R6C6): field 'date_of_birth' must match format: date must match format DD.MM.YYYY (%d.%m.%Y) but is: '30.02.1994' (day is out of range for month)

Note that it is possible for the reader to throw other exceptions, for example
of type ``IOError`` in case the file cannot be read at all or
``CutplaceUnicodeError`` (which does not inherit from ``CutplaceError``) in
case the encoding does not match. You should not continue after such errors as
they indicate a problem not related to the data but either in the specification
or environment.

The ``errors`` parameter can also take the values ``"strict"`` (which is the
default and raises a ``CutplaceError`` on encountering the first error as
described above) and ``"ignore"``, which silently ignores any error and moves
on with the next row. The latter can be useful during prototyping a new
application when CID's and data are in a constant state of flux. In production
code ``errors="ignore"`` mainly represents a very efficient way to shoot
yourself into the foot.

Processing data
---------------

As a first step, we should figure out where in each row we can find the first
name and the surname. We need to do this only once so this happens outside of
the processing loop. The names used to find the indices must match the names
used in the CID.


>>> firstNameIndex = icd.getFieldNameIndex("first_name")
>>> surnameIndex =  icd.getFieldNameIndex("surname")

Now we can read the data just like before. Instead of a simple ``pass`` loop we
obtain the first name from ``row`` and check if it starts with "J". If so, we
compute the full name and print it:

>>> for row in interface.validatedRows(icd, validCsvPath):
...   firstName = row[firstNameIndex]
...   if firstName.startswith("J"):
...      surname = row[surnameIndex]
...      fullName = surname + ", " + firstName
...      print fullName
Doe, John
Miller, Jane

Of course nothing prevents you from doing more glamourous things here like
inserting the data into a database or rendering them to a dynamic web page.

>>> icd.read(cid_path)
>>> # Validate the data.
>>> for row in interface.validatedRows(icd, dataPath):
...   pass # We could also do something useful with the data in ``row`` here.

In case you want to process the data, simply replace the ``pass`` inside the
loop by whatever needs to be done.

In case you want to continue even if a row was rejected, use the optional
parameter ``errors="yield"`` as described earlier.

Writting data
-------------

To validate written data, use ``interface.Writer``. A ``Writer`` needs an CID
tovalidate against and an output to write to. The output can be any filelike
object such as a file or a ``StringIO``. For example::

  >>> import StringIO
  >>> out = StringIO.StringIO()

Now you can create a writer and write a valid row to it::

  >>> writer = interface.Writer(icd, out)
  >>> writer.writeRow(['38000', '234', 'John', 'Doe', 'male', '08.03.1957'])

Attempting to write broken data results in an ``Exception`` derived from
``CutplaceError``::

  >>> writer.writeRow(['38000', 'not a number', 'Jane', 'Miller', 'female', '04.10.1946']) #doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  FieldValueError: <io> (R1C2): field 'customer_id' must match format: value must be an integer number: 'not a number'

Note that after a ``CutplaceError`` you can continue writing. For any other
``Exception`` such as ``IOError`` it is recommended to stop writing and
consider it an unrecoverable situation.

Once done, close both the writer and the output::

  >>> writer.close()
  >>> out.close()

As ``interface.Writer`` implements the context management protocoll, you can
also use the ``with`` statement to automatically ``close()`` it when done.

Note that ``Writer.close()`` performs cutplace checks and consequently can
raise a ``CheckError``.


Advanced usage
==============

In the previous section, you learned how to read an CID and use it to validate
data using a few simple API calls. You also learned how to handle errors
detected in the data.

With this knowledge, you should be able to write your own small validation
scripts that process the results in any meaningful way you want by adding your
own code to log errors, send validation reports via email or automatically
insert accepted rows in a data base. The Python standard library offers
powerful modules for all these tasks.

In case you are already happy and found everything you need, you can stop
reading this chapter and move on with implementing your tasks.

If however you need more flexibility, suffer from API
`OCPD <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_personality_disorder>`_
or just want to know what else cutplace offers in case you might need it one
day, the following sections describe the lower level hooks of cutplace API.
They are more powerful and flexible, but also more difficult to use.

Building an CID in the code
---------------------------

In some cases it might be preferable to include the CID in the code, for
instance for trivial interfaces that are only used internally. Here is an
example of a simple CID for CSV data with 3 fields:

First, import the necessary modules:

>>> from cutplace import data
>>> from cutplace import fields
>>> from cutplace import interface

Next create an empty CID:

>>> icd = interface.InterfaceControlDocument()

As the CID will not be read from an input file, error messages would not be
able to refer to any file in case of errors. To have at least some reference,
we need to tell the CID that it is declared from source code:

>>> icd.setLocationToSourceCode()

That way, error messages will refer you to the Python module where this call
happened.

>>> # Use CSV as data format. This is the same as having a spreadsheet
>>> # with the cells:
>>> #
>>> # | F | Format         | CSV |
>>> # | F | Item separator | ;   |
>>> icd.addDataFormat([data.KEY_FORMAT, data.FORMAT_CSV])
>>> icd.addDataFormat([data.KEY_ITEM_DELIMITER, ";"])
>>>
>>> # Add a couple of fields.
>>> icd.addFieldFormat(["id", "", "", "1:5", "Integer"])
>>> icd.addFieldFormat(["name"])
>>> icd.addFieldFormat(["dateOfBirth", "", "X", "", "DateTime", "YYYY-MM-DD"])
>>>

>>>
>>> # Add a couple of fields.

instance for trivial interfaces that are only used internally. Here is an
example of a simple CID for CSV data with 3 fields:

First, import the necessary modules:

>>> from cutplace import data
>>> from cutplace import fields
>>> from cutplace import interface

Next create an empty CID:

>>> icd = interface.InterfaceControlDocument()

As the CID will not be read from an input file, error messages would not be
able to refer to any file in case of errors. To have at least some reference,
we need to tell the CID that it is declared from source code:

>>> icd.setLocationToSourceCode()

That way, error messages will refer you to the Python module where this call
happened.

>>> # Use CSV as data format. This is the same as having a spreadsheet
>>> # with the cells:
>>> #
>>> # | F | Format         | CSV |
>>> # | F | Item separator | ;   |
>>> icd.addDataFormat([data.KEY_FORMAT, data.FORMAT_CSV])
>>> icd.addDataFormat([data.KEY_ITEM_DELIMITER, ";"])
>>>
>>> # Add a couple of fields.
>>> icd.addFieldFormat(["id", "", "", "1:5", "Integer"])
>>> icd.addFieldFormat(["name"])
>>> icd.addFieldFormat(["dateOfBirth", "", "X", "", "DateTime", "YYYY-MM-DD"])
>>>
>>> # Make sure that the `id` field contains only unique values.
>>> icd.addCheck(["id_must_be_unique", "IsUnique", "id"])

>>> icd.fieldNames
['id', 'name', 'dateOfBirth']

If any of this methods cannot handle the parameters you passed, they raise a
``CutplaceError`` with a message describing what went wrong. For example::

  >>> icd.addCheck([]) #doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  InterfaceError: <source> (R1C2): check row (marked with 'c') must contain at least 2 columns

Validating with listeners
-------------------------

Once the CID is set up, you can validate data using ``validate()``:

>>> cid_path = os.path.join(os.pardir, "tests", "input", "icds", "customers.csv")
>>> icd = interface.InterfaceControlDocument()
>>> icd.read(cid_path)
>>>
>>> validCsvPath = os.path.join(os.pardir, "tests", "input", "valid_customers.csv")
>>> icd.validate(validCsvPath)

So what happens if the data contain errors? Let's give it a try:

>>> brokenCsvPath = os.path.join(os.pardir, "tests", "input", "broken_customers.csv")
>>> icd.validate(brokenCsvPath)

Again, the validation runs through without any ``Exception`` or other
indication that something is wrong.

The reason for that is that cutplace should be able to continue in case a data
row is rejected. Raising an ``Exception`` would defeat that. So instead, it
informs interested listeners about validation events. To act on events, define
a class inheriting from ``BaseValidationListener`` and overwrite the methods
for the events you are interested in:

>>> class ErrorPrintingValidationListener(interface.BaseValidationListener):
...     def rejectedRow(self, row, error):
...         print "%r" % row
...         print "error: %s" % error

This is a very simple listener which is only interested about rejected rows. In
case this happens, it simply prints the row and the error that was detected in it.
To learn about other events this listener can receive, take a look at the API
documentation of
`BaseValidationListener <api/cutplace.interface.BaseValidationListener-class.html>`_

To actually get some information about validation errors, you have to create
such a listener and attach it to an CID:

>>> errorPrintingValidationListener = ErrorPrintingValidationListener()
>>> icd.addValidationListener(errorPrintingValidationListener)

Let's see what happens if we validate broken data again:

>>> icd.validate(brokenCsvPath)
['12345', '92', 'Bill', 'Carter', 'male', '05.04.1953']
error: broken_customers.csv (R4C1): field 'branch_id' must match format: value '12345' must match regular expression: '38\\d\\d\\d'
['38111', 'XX', 'Sue', 'Brown', 'female', '08.02.1962']
error: broken_customers.csv (R5C2): field 'customer_id' must match format: value must be an integer number: 'XX'
['38088', '83', 'Rose', 'Baker', 'female', '30.02.1994']
error: broken_customers.csv (R6C6): field 'date_of_birth' must match format: date must match format DD.MM.YYYY (%d.%m.%Y) but is: '30.02.1994' (day is out of range for month)

When you are done, remove the listener::

>>> icd.removeValidationListener(errorPrintingValidationListener)


Writing field formats
---------------------

Cutplace already ships with several field formats found in
:py:mod:`cutplace.fields` module that should cover most needs. If
however you have some very special requirements, you can write your own
formats.

Simply inherit from ``AbstractFieldFormat`` and optionally provide a
constructor to parse the ``rule`` parameter. Next, implement
``validatedValue(self, value)`` that validates that the text in ``value``
conforms to ``rule``. If not, raise an ``FieldValueError`` with a descriptive
error message.

Here is a very simple example of a field format that accepts values of "red",
"green" and "blue".

>>> class ColorFieldFormat(fields.AbstractFieldFormat):
...     def __init__(self, fieldName, isAllowedToBeEmpty, length, rule, dataFormat):
...         super(ColorFieldFormat, self).__init__(fieldName, isAllowedToBeEmpty, length, rule, dataFormat, emptyValue="")
...
...     def validatedValue(self, value):
...         # Validate that ``value`` is a color and return it.
...         assert value
...         if value not in ["red", "green", "blue"]:
...             raise fields.FieldValueError("color value is %r but must be one of: red, green, blue" % value)
...         return value

The ``value`` parameter is a Unicode string. Cutplace ensures that
``validatedValue()`` will never be called with an empty ``value`` parameter,
hence the ``assert value`` - it will cause an ``AssertionError`` if ``value``
is ``""`` or ``None`` because that would mean cutplace is broken.

>>> colorField = ColorFieldFormat("roofColor", False, "", "", icd.dataFormat)
>>> colorField.validated("red")
'red'

Of course you could have achieved similar results using `fields.ChoiceFieldFormat
<api/fields.ChoiceFieldFormat-class.html>`_. However, a custom field format can
do more. In particular, ``validatedValue()`` does not have to return a string.
It can return any Python type and even ``None``. The result will be used in the
``row`` array cutplace sends to any `BaseValidationListener.acceptedRow()
<api/cutplace.interface.BaseValidationListener-class.html#acceptedRow>`_.

Here's a more advanced ``ColorFieldFormat`` that returns the color as a
tuple of RGB items:

>>> class ColorFieldFormat(fields.AbstractFieldFormat):
...     def __init__(self, fieldName, isAllowedToBeEmpty, length, rule, dataFormat):
...         super(ColorFieldFormat, self).__init__(fieldName, isAllowedToBeEmpty, length, rule, dataFormat, emptyValue="")
...
...     def validatedValue(self, colorName):
...         # Validate that ``colorName`` is a color and return its RGB representation.
...         assert colorName
...         if colorName == "red":
...             result = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
...         elif colorName == "green":
...             result = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
...         elif colorName == "blue":
...             result = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
...         else:
...             raise fields.FieldValueError("color name is %r but must be one of: red, green, blue" % colorName)
...         return result

For a simple test, let's see this field format in action:

>>> colorField = ColorFieldFormat("roofColor", False, "", "", icd.dataFormat)
>>> colorField.validated("red")
(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
>>> colorField.validated("yellow")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
FieldValueError: color name is 'yellow' but must be one of: red, green, blue

Before you learned that ``validatedValue()`` never gets called with an empty
value. So what happens if you declare a color field that allows empty values,
for instance:

>>> # Sets ``isAllowedToBeEmpty`` to ``True`` to accept empty values.
>>> colorField = ColorFieldFormat("roofColor", True, "", "", icd.dataFormat)
>>> colorField.validated("")
''
>>> # Not quiet a color tuple...

Well, that's not quite what we want. Instead of an empty string, some default
RGB tuple would be a lot more useful. Say, ``(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`` to represent
black.

Fortunately field formats can just specify that by using the ``emptyValue``
parameter in the constructor. When passed to the ``super`` constructor in
``AbstractFieldFormat``, everything will be taken care of. So here's a
slightly modified version:

>>> class ColorFieldFormat(fields.AbstractFieldFormat):
...     def __init__(self, fieldName, isAllowedToBeEmpty, length, rule, dataFormat):
...         super(ColorFieldFormat, self).__init__(fieldName, isAllowedToBeEmpty, length, rule, dataFormat,
...                 emptyValue=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)) # Use black as "empty" color.
...
...     def validatedValue(self, colorName):
...         # (Exactly same as before)
...         assert colorName
...         if colorName == "red":
...             result = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
...         elif colorName == "green":
...             result = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
...         elif colorName == "blue":
...             result = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
...         else:
...             raise fields.FieldValueError("color name is %r but must be one of: red, green, blue" % colorName)
...         return result

Let's give it a try:

>>> colorField = ColorFieldFormat("roofColor", True, "", "", icd.dataFormat)
>>> colorField.validated("red")
(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
>>> colorField.validated("")
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

Writing checks
--------------

Writing checks is quite similar to writing field formats. However, the
interaction with the validation is more complex.

Checks have to implement certain methods described in `checks.AbstractCheck
<api/cutplace.checks.AbstractCheck-class.html>`_. For each check, cutplace
performs the following actions:

#. When reading the CID, call the check's ``__init__()``.
#. When starting to read a set of data, call the checks's ``reset()``.
#. For each row of data, call the checks's ``checkRow()``.
#. When done with a set of data, call the checks's ``checkAtEnd()``.

The remainder of this section will describe how to implement each of
these methods. As an example, we implement a check to ensure that
each customer's full name requires less than 100 characters. The field
formats already ensure that ``first_name`` and ``last_name`` are at most
60 characters each. However, assuming the full name is derived using the
expression::

    last_name + ", " + first_name

this could lead to full names with up to 122 characters.

To implements this check, start by inheriting from `checks.AbstractCheck
<api/cutplace.checks.AbstractCheck-class.html>`_:

>>> from cutplace import checks
>>> class FullNameLengthIsInRangeCheck(checks.AbstractCheck):
...     """Check that total length of customer name is within the specified range."""

Next, implement a constructor to which cutplace can pass the values
found in the CID. For example, for our check the CID would contain:

+-+-------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----+
+ +Description                                +Type                    +Rule +
+=+===========================================+========================+=====+
+C+full name must have at most 100 characters +FullNameLengthIsInRange +:100 +
+-+-------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----+

When cutplace encounters this line, it will create a new check by calling
``checks.FullNameLengthIsInRangeCheck.__init__()``, passing the following
parameters:

* ``description="customer must be unique"``, which is just a human readable
  description of the check to refer to it in error messages
* ``rule=":100"``, which describes what exactly the check
  should do. Each check can define its own syntax for the rule. In case of
  ``FullNameLengthIsInRange`` the rule describes a `ranges.Range <api/cutplace.ranges.Range-class.html>`_.
* ``availableFieldNames=["branch_id", "customer_id", "first_name","last_name",
  "gender", "date_of_birth"]`` (as defined in the CID and using the same order)
* ``location`` being the ``tools.Location`` in the CID where the check was defined.

The constructor basically has to do 3 things:

#. Call the super constructor
#. Perform optional initialization needed by the check that needs to be
   done only once and not on each new data set. In most cases, this involves
   parsing the ``rule`` parameter and obtain whatever information the checks needs
   from it.
#. Call ``self.reset()``. This is not really necessary for this check, but in most
   cases it will make your life easier because you can avoid redundant initializations
   in the constructor.

>>> from cutplace import ranges
>>> class FullNameLengthIsInRangeCheck(checks.AbstractCheck):
...     """Check that total length of customer name is within the specified range."""
...     def __init__(self, description, rule, availableFieldNames, location=None):
...         super(FullNameLengthIsInRangeCheck, self).__init__(description, rule, availableFieldNames, location)
...         self._fullNameRange = ranges.Range(rule)
...         self.reset()

Once cutplace is done reading the CID, it moves on to data. For each set of
data it calls the checks `reset()
<api/cutplace.checks.AbstractCheck-class.html#reset>`_ method. For our simple
check, no actions are needed so we are good already because ``AbstractCheck``
already provides a ``reset()`` that does nothing.

When cutplace validates data, it reads them row by row. For each row, it
calls `validated() <api/cutplace.fields.AbstractFieldFormat-class.html#validated>`_
on each cell in the row. In case all cells are valid, it collects them in a
dictionary which maps the field name to its native value. Recall the interface
from the :doc:`tutorial`, which defined the following fields:

+-+--------------------+----------+------+------+--------+------------+
+ +Name                +Example   +Empty?+Length+Type    +Rule        +
+=+====================+==========+======+======+========+============+
+F+branch_id           +38000     +      +5     +        +            +
+-+--------------------+----------+------+------+--------+------------+
+F+customer_id         +16        +      +2:    +Integer +10:65535    +
+-+--------------------+----------+------+------+--------+------------+
+F+first_name          +Jane      +      +:60   +        +            +
+-+--------------------+----------+------+------+--------+------------+
+F+surname             +Doe       +      +:60   +        +            +
+-+--------------------+----------+------+------+--------+------------+
+F+gender              +female    +      +2:6   +Choice  +male, female+
+-+--------------------+----------+------+------+--------+------------+
+F+date_of_birth       +27.02.1946+X     +10    +DateTime+DD.MM.YYYY  +
+-+--------------------+----------+------+------+--------+------------+

Now consider a data row with the following values:

+---------+-----------+----------+-------+------+-------------+
+Branch id+Customer id+First name+Surname+Gender+Date of birth+
+=========+===========+==========+=======+======+=============+
+38111    +96         +Andrew    +Dixon  +male  +02.10.1913   +
+---------+-----------+----------+-------+------+-------------+

The row map for this row would be::

  rowMap = {
      "branch_id": 38111,
      "customer_id": 96,
      "first_name": "Andrew",
      "last_name": "Dixon",
      "gender": "male",
      "date_of_birth": time.struct_time(tm_year=1913, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=2, ...)
  }

With this knowledge, we can easily implement a ``checkRow`` that computes the
full name and checks that it is within the required range. If not, it raises
a `CheckError <api/cutplace.checks.CheckError-class.html>`_:

>>> def checkRow(self, rowMap, location):
...     fullName = rowMap["last_name"] + ", " + rowMap["first_name"]
...     fullNameLength = len(fullName)
...     try:
...         self._fullNameRange.validate("full name", fullNameLength)
...     except errors.RangeValueError as error:
...         raise errors.CheckError("full name length is %d but must be in range %s: %r" \
...                 % (fullNameLength, self._fullNameRange, fullName))

And finally, there is
`checkAtEnd() <api/cutplace.checks.AbstractCheck-class.html#checkAtEnd>`_ which
is called when all data rows have been processed. Note that ``checkAtEnd()``
does not have any parameters that contain actual data. Instead you typically
would collect all information needed by ``checkAtEnd()`` in ``checkRow()`` and
store them in instance variables.

Because our ``FullNameLengthIsInRangeCheck`` does not need to do anything here,
we can omit it and keep inherit an empty implementation from ``AbstractCheck``.

.. _using-own-check-and-field-formats:

Using your own checks and field format
--------------------------------------

Now that you know how to write your own field format, it would be nice to
actually utilize it in an CID. For this purpose, cutplace lets you import
plugins that can define their own fields.

Plugins are standard Python modules that define classes based on
``fields.AbstractFieldFormat`` and ``checks.AbstractCheck``. For our
example, create a folder named ``~/cutplace_plugins`` and store a Python
module named ``myplugins.py`` in it with the following contents:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/plugins.py

The CID can now refer to ``ColorFieldFormat`` as ``Color`` (without
``FieldFormat``) and to ``FullNameLengthIsInRangeCheck`` as
``FullNameLengthIsInRange`` (without ``Check``). For example:

+-+-----------------+-------+------+------+-----+----+
+ +Interface: colors+       +      +      +     +    +
+-+-----------------+-------+------+------+-----+----+
+ +                 +       +      +      +     +    +
+-+-----------------+-------+------+------+-----+----+
+ +Data format      +       +      +      +     +    +

+-+-----------------+-------+------+------+-----+----+
+ +                 +       +      +      +     +    +

+ +Fields           +       +      +      +     +    +
+-+-----------------+-------+------+------+-----+----+
+ +Name             +Example+Empty?+Length+Type +Rule+
+-+-----------------+-------+------+------+-----+----+
+F+item             +tree   +      +      +     +    +
+-+-----------------+-------+------+------+-----+----+
+F+color            +green  +      +      +Color+    +
+-+-----------------+-------+------+------+-----+----+

See: :download:`cid_colors.ods <../examples/cid_colors.ods>`

Here is a data file where all but one row conforms to the CID:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/colors.csv

See: :download:`colors.csv <../examples/colors.csv>`

To tell cutplace where the plugins folder is located, use the command line
option ``--plugins``. Assuming that your ``myplugins.py`` is stored in
``~/cutplace_plugins`` you can run::

  cutplace --plugins ~/cutplace_plugins cid_colors.ods colors.csv

The output is::

  ERROR:cutplace:field error: colors.csv (R5C2): field 'color' must match format: color name is 'yellow' but must be one of: red, green, blue
  colors.csv: rejected 1 of 5 rows. 0 final checks failed.

If you are unsure which plugins exactly cutplace imports, use ``--log=info``.
For example, the output could contain::

  INFO:cutplace:import plugins from "/Users/me/cutplace_plugins"
  INFO:cutplace:  import plugins from "/Users/me/cutplace_plugins/myplugins.py"
  INFO:cutplace:    fields found: ['ColorFieldFormat']
  INFO:cutplace:    checks found: ['FullNameLengthIsInRangeCheck']
