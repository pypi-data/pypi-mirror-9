Experimentation
===============

In this section, some experiments with Scrapple are provided. There are two main types of tools that can be implemented with the Scrapple framework :

- :doc:`intro/tutorials/single_linear`
- :doc:`intro/tutorials/link_crawler`

Once you've :doc:`installed Scrapple <intro/install>`, you can see the list of available :ref:`commands <framework-commands>` and the related options using the command

``$ scrapple --help``

The :ref:`configuration file <framework-config>` is the backbone of Scrapple. It specifies the base page URL, selectors for the data extraction, the follow link for the link crawler and several other parameters. 

Examples for each type are given.
