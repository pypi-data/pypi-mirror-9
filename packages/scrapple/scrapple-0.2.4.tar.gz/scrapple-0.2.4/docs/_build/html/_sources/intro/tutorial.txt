In this section, we'll cover some basic tutorials for using Scrapple. We'll cover two basic types of tools you can build with Scrapple.

- Single page linear scrapers
- Link crawlers

Once you've :doc:`installed Scrapple <install>`, you can see the list of available commands and the related options using the command

``$ scrapple --help``


The description for the commands provided by Scrapple are described in the :ref:`commands <topics-commands>` section.

The :ref:`configuration file <topics-config>` is the backbone of Scrapple. It specifies the base page URL, selectors for the data extraction, the follow link for the link crawler and several other parameters. 

Examples for each type are given.
