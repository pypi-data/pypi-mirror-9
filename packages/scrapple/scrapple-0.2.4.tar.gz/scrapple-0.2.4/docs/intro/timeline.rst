The project repository was hosted on `GitHub <http://github.com/>`_. This provided multiple benefits :

* Ease of collaboration between project members
* Convenient version control of project
* Setting up continuous integration testing on the project
* Metrics for analysis of project progress

The metrics provided by GitHub can be used to visually represent the contributions to the project over the duration of the project work.
