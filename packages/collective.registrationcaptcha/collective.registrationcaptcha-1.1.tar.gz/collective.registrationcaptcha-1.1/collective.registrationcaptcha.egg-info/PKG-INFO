Description: collective.registrationcaptcha
        ==============================
        
        Add a captcha field to the @@register form for anonymous users form to secure
        it from spam bots.
        
        It depends on ``plone.app.discussion`` and uses it's captcha abstaction
        facilities.
        
        In order to use a captcha widget, you have to install one - wether
        by depending on the ``captchawidgets`` extra of this package or by installing
        ``plone.formwidget.captcha``, ``plone.formwidget.recaptcha`` (not functional at
        time of this writing) or ``collective.z3cform.norobots``.
        Then you have to configure plone.app.discussion to use a captcha widget. You
        don't need to keep the discussion activated, if you don't want them to be
        active on your site.
