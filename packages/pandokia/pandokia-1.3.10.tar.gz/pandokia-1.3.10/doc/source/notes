We encountered a test manager that had to work within a particular
management framework where she had no authority to require the
developers to write tests or to follow any particular structure
for their tests.  Instead, she had to persuade them to write
useful tests.

Vicki described this as "Make them test, but don't make them mad."

On observing a project where there is no formal test structure, but
most of the developers were using some sort of testing (but each
doing something different):

Vicki says "That's a nice place to start"

Mark says "but it's a terrible place to finish."
