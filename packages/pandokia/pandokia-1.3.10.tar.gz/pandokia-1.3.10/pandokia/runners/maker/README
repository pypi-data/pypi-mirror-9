fct.h
	Taken unmodified from fctx-1.6.1; this is here as a convenience
	so you do not have to install it separately.  A test written
	for fctx can run with just this file.  For a complete fctx 
	distribution, see

	http://fctx.wildbearsoftware.com/

	It is subject to a BSD license, noted at the top of the file.

	The fctx web site has been down for a while, so we have installed
	a copy of the documentation at

	http://ssb.stsci.edu/testing/fctx/user/

pandokia_fct.h
	Pandokia custom logger for fctx.  See comments at the top for
	how to write pandokia-capable tests.

pdk_c_logger.c
pdk_c_logger.h
	Tools for a C program to write pandokia logs directly.	You would
	use this if you want to write your tests without a test framework
	(like fctx) and write your test results directly.
