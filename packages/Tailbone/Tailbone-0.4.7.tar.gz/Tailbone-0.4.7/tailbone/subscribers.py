    Add a ``rattail_config`` attribute to a request object.

    This function is really just a matter of convenience, but it should help to
    make other code more terse (example below).  It is designed to act as a
    subscriber to the Pyramid ``NewRequest`` event.

    A global Rattail ``config`` should already be present within the Pyramid
    application registry's settings, which would normally be accessed via::
    
       request.registry.settings['rattail_config']

    directly accessible, a la::

       request.rattail_config

       All this of course assumes that a Rattail ``config`` object *has* in
       fact already been placed in the application registry settings.  If this
       is not the case, this function will do nothing.
