An instance_url keyword argument was added to V1Meta and V1Client. This argument can be specified instead of the address, instance_path, scheme, and port arguments.\n* Improved: Performance. A performance enhancement was made to calls such as list(v1.Story.Name). The requested attribute is added to the select list if it's not present, thus preventing an HTTP GET for each matched asset.\n* Improved: Examples. Some poor examples were removed and logging cleaned up in places.\n* Fix: NTLM. Fix some issues with NTLM and urllib2. (thanks campbellr)\n* Fix: Deferencing. Missing attributes now return a None-like object can be deferenced to any depth. (thanks bazsi)",
