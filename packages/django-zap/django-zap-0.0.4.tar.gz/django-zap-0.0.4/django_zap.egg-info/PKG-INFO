Description: ==========
        Django-Zap
        ==========
        
        What?
        -----
        
        Automates the destruction and recreation of django databases.
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        In the early stages of development when your models are heavily in flux, you
        want to be frequently dropping and recreating the database before re-running
        django's ``syncdb`` command. This tool uses the database settings in your
        settings file to prevent you having to duplicate them in some separate database
        drop/create script.
        
        How?
        ----
        
        Just add ``zap`` to your installed apps.
        
        Backends
        --------
        
        At the moment the only backend is for linux machines running a local postgresql
        instance, and authentication is done using the ident rule in the ``pg_hba.conf``,
        then calling psql as the ``postgres`` user.
        
        Feel free to provide more backends or extend the one we have, perhaps to include
        mac support, or support for other django database engines.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.0.4 (2015-04-01)
        ------------------
        
        - #3 Adds a new flag ``--dropconnections``, disabled by default, that tells
          postgres to terminate all existing sessions before zapping. This is to work
          around an issue where third party applications open database connections
          upon app registry installation.
