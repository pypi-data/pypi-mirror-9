Description: ==========
        Django-Zap
        ==========
        
        What?
        -----
        
        Automates the destruction and recreation of django databases.
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        In the early stages of development when your models are heavily in flux, you
        want to be frequently dropping and recreating the database before re-running
        django's ``syncdb`` command. This tool uses the database settings in your
        settings file to prevent you having to duplicate them in some separate database
        drop/create script.
        
        How?
        ----
        
        Just add ``zap`` to your installed apps.
        
        Backends
        --------
        
        At the moment the only backend is for linux machines running a local postgresql
        instance, and authentication is done using the ident rule in the ``pg_hba.conf``,
        then calling psql as the ``postgres`` user.
        
        Feel free to provide more backends or extend the one we have, perhaps to include
        mac support, or support for other django database engines.
