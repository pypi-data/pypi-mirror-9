Usage
=====

Once this module is installed (such as by using the ``setup_requires``
argument), desktop entry files will be automatically installed for each
``gui_scripts`` entry point. Example::

    setup(
        ...
        setup_requires=['install_freedesktop'],
        entry_points={
            'gui_scripts': [
                'myapp=myapp:main',
            ],
        },
    )

This would create *myapp.desktop*, setting the Name and Icon keys to “myapp”
and Exec to the full path of the script.

To customize, or add desktop files for non-entry-point based scripts, pass a
dict to the ``desktop_entries`` argument, where each key matches a script name
and its value is a dict containing the desktop entry keys/values. Example::

    setup(
        ...
        setup_requires=['install_freedesktop'],
        scripts=['myscript'],
        desktop_entries={
            'myscript': {
                'Name': 'MyApp',
                'GenericName': 'Data Processor',
                'Categories': 'Office;Database;',
            },
        },
    )

Notes
=====

Either system-wide or ``--user`` mode installation is supported, as well as
``--root=`` (for package builders). But the setuptools default egg-based
installation does not work. (It doesn't run ``install_`` subcommands; even if
it did, the data files would go in the egg, not the real data directory.) So
you must either use ``pip`` (recommended) or provide the
``--single-version-externally-managed`` option yourself, on the command line or
in *setup.cfg*. Wheels and any other relocatable bdist formats will also not
work, due to the need to use the final script path for the Exec in the desktop
file.

Using the ``setup_requires`` argument is potentially dangerous: if the package
is not found, EasyInstall will be invoked to fetch it from PyPI, even if the
user thinks they have disabled this or chosen a different index. See
https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#controlling-setup-requires.

There is no automatic handling of icon files presently, though that's in scope
for this project. Quick example for doing it manually::

    setup(
        ...
        data_files=[
            ('share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps', ['icons/16x16/myapp.png']),
            ('share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps', ['icons/48x48/myapp.png']),
            ('share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps', ['icons/scalable/myapp.svg']),
        ],
    )
