Description: ``pypmc`` is a python package focusing on adaptive importance
        sampling.  It can be used for integration and sampling from a
        user-defined target density. A typical application is Bayesian
        inference, where one wants to sample from the posterior to marginalize
        over parameters and to compute the evidence. The key idea is to create
        a good proposal density by adapting a mixture of Gaussian or student's
        t components to the target density. The package is able to efficiently
        integrate multimodal functions in up to about 30-40 dimensions at the
        level of 1% accuracy or less. For many problems, this is achieved
        without requiring any manual input from the user about details of the
        function. Importance sampling supports parallelization on multiple
        machines via ``mpi4py``.
        
        Useful tools that can be used stand-alone include:
        
        * importance sampling (sampling & integration)
        * adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (sampling)
        * variational Bayes (clustering)
        * population Monte Carlo (clustering)
