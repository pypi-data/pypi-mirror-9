Input file template
====================

.. include:: colors.rst

.. pull-quote::
    This is what the input file of parameters looks like. Everything is in here and it
    should be used as a template for your data. Note the :red:`blank space` between the variable
    and its value. This input file is case insensitive and after each run a copy of the
    input file is saved along with the results
