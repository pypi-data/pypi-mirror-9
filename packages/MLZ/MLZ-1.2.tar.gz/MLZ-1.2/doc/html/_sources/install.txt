Installation
============
.. include:: colors.rst

Download
.........
    You can get the latest version of the code from: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MLZ/1.2

    The simplest way to get MLZ is using pip::

        [sudo] pip install MLZ

    or::

        pip install MLZ --user

    or even::

        easy_install --user MLZ

    which will install and copy all the files to a local directory which can be specified by using the :green:`--prefix=<path>` flag.
    Open python and check if the module is present::

        >>> import mlz

    The code can also be installed manually, by getting the tar file and then uncompress the file::

        tar -zxf MLZ-1.2.tar.gz

    and install using::

        python setup.py install --user

    which is not required for the code to run via standard way. This will create a copy of the code in a local directory and a few
    executable files will be copied to a local script folder (usually at :mono:`$HOME/.local/bin`). This also compiles automatically the fortran routines needed
    for better performance.

    Another alternative is to get the latest version from github and clone it folmr there::

        git clone https://github.com/mgckind/MLZ.git

    and it can be run from the MLZ/ directory itself.

Fortran routines
................

    If the installation did not work via :green:`setup.py` as shown, some fortran libraries will not be present,
    these can be manually compiled using the f2py_ wrapper. In the :mono:`mlz` folder, go to the :mono:`ml_codes` folder where
    you will find the file :green:`som.f90` in that folder::

        f2py -c -m somF som.f90

    And the library :green:`somF.so` will be created. The code still works even this step is not accomplished as these routines aid the code to run
    more efficiently.

Uninstall
.........

    You can uninstall MLZ by deleting the files manually with::

        python setup.py install --user --record installed_files.txt
        cat installed_files.txt | xargs rm -rf
        rm -rf installed_files

    Then proceed to delete mlz folder in the local installation.

    Or you can use::

        pip uninstall MLZ
