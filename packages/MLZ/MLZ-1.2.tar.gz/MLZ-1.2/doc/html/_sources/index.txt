    **MLZ**, "\ **M**\achine \ **L**\earning and photo-\ **Z**\"  is a parallel python framework that
    computes fast and robust photometric redshift PDFs using Machine Learning algorithms. In particular,
    it uses a supervised technique with prediction trees and random forest through :ref:`TPZ <tpz2>` or
    a unsupervised methods with self organizing maps and random atlas
    through :ref:`SOMz <somz2>`. It can be easily extended to other regression or classification problems.
    We recently have added an additional feature that allows high compressed representation of the photo-z
    PDFs using :ref:`sparse representation <sparse2>`. This allow to efficiently store and handle a large number
    of PDF from different techniques
