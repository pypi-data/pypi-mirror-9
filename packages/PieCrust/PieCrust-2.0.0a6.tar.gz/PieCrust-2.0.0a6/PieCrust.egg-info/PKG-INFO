        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        If you want to quickly give it a spin:
        
        ::
        
            pip install piecrust
            chef init mywebsite
            cd mywebsite
            chef serve
        
        It should create a new empty site in a ``mywebsite`` folder, and start a small
        web server to preview it. You can then point your browser to ``localhost:8080``
        to see the default home page.
        
        Use ``chef prepare page`` and ``chef prepare post`` to create pages and posts,
        and edit those in your favorite text editor.
        
        When you're happy, run ``chef bake`` to generate the final static website,
        which you'll find in ``_counter``. At this point you can upload the contents of
        ``_counter`` to your server.
