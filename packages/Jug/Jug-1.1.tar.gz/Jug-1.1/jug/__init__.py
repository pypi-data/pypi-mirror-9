JUG: Coarse Level Parallelisation for Python
============================================

The main use of jug is from the command line::

    jug status jugfile.py
    jug execute jugfile.py

You import jug to help you write your jugfiles.

Main Contents
-------------

Task : Task class
    Task(function, arg0, arg1, arg2,...)

TaskGenerator : functional decorator

CachedFunction : load a function result from disk, running it if needed

barrier : function
    if you place this anywhere in a jugfile, it assures that all tasks up to
    this point have completed before proceeding.
