        A custom user model app for Django 1.5+ that features email as username and
        other things. It tries to stay true to the built-in user model for the most
        part.
        
        The main differences between authtools's User and django.contrib.auth's are
        email as username and class-based auth views.
        
        Read the `django-authtools documentation
        <https://django-authtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        Before you use this, you should probably read the documentation about `custom
        User models
        <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#substituting-a-custom-user-model>`_.
        
        1.  Install the package::
        
                $ pip install django-authtools
        
        2.  Add ``authtools`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
        3.  Add the following to your settings.py::
        
                AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'authtools.User'
        
        4.  Add ``authtools.urls`` to your URL patterns::
        
                urlpatterns = patterns('',
                    # ...
                    url(r'^accounts/', include('authtools.urls')),
                    # ...
                )
        
        5.  Enjoy.
        
        
        CHANGES
        =======

        ------------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        1.1.0 (2015-02-24)
        ------------------
        
          - PasswordChangeView now handles a ``next`` URL parameter (#24)
        
        1.0.0 (released August 16, 2014)
        --------------------------------
        
          - Add friendly_password_reset view and FriendlyPasswordResetForm (Antoine Catton, #18)
          - **Bugfix** Allow LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL to be unicode (Alan Johnson, Gavin Wahl, Rocky Meza, #13)
          - **Backwards Incompatible** Dropped support for Python 3.2
        
        0.2.2 (released July 21, 2014)
        ------------------------------
        
          - Update safe urls in tests
          - Give the ability to restrain which users can reset their password
          - Add send_mail to AbstractEmailUser. (Jorge C. Leit√£o)
        
        
        0.2.1
        -----
        
          - Bugfix: UserAdmin was expecting a User with a `name` field.
        
        0.2.0
        -----
        
          - Django 1.6 support.
        
            Django 1.6 `broke backwards compatibility
            <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.6/#django-contrib-auth-password-reset-uses-base-64-encoding-of-user-pk>`_
            of the ``password_reset_confirm`` view. Be sure to update any references to
            this URL. Rather than using a separate view for each encoding, authtools uses
            :class:`a single view <authtools.views.PasswordResetConfirmView>` that works
            with both.
        
          - Bugfix: if LOGIN_URL was a URL name, it wasn't being reversed in the
            PasswordResetConfirmView.
        
        0.1.2 (released July 01, 2013)
        ------------------------------
        
          - Use ``prefetch_related`` in the :class:`~authtools.forms.UserChangeForm`
            to avoid doing hundreds of ``ContentType`` queries. The form from
            Django has the same feature, it wasn't copied over correctly in our
            original form.
        
        0.1.1 (released May 30, 2013)
        -----------------------------
        
        * some bugfixes:
        
          - Call :meth:`UserManager.normalize_email` on an instance, not a class.
          - :class:`~authtools.models.User` should inherit its parent's ``Meta``.
        
        0.1.0 (released May 28, 2013)
        -----------------------------
