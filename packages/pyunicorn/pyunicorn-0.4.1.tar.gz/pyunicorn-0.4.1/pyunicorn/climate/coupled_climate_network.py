    Encapsulates a coupled similarity network embedded on a spherical surface.

    Particularly provides functionality to generate a complex network from the

    observables (temperature, pressure), vertical levels etc.

    So far, most methods only give meaningful results for undirected networks!

    The idea of coupled climate networks is based on the concept of coupled
    patterns, for a review refer to [Bretherton1992]_.

    Derived from classes InteractingNetworks and ClimateNetwork.
