    """
    Encapsulates a coupled similarity network embedded on a spherical surface.

    Particularly provides functionality to generate a complex network from the
    Pearson correlation matrix of time series from two different
    observables (temperature, pressure), vertical levels etc.

    Construct a static climate network following Tsonis et al. from the
    Pearson correlation matrix at zero lag [Tsonis2004]_.

    Hence, coupled Tsonis climate networks are undirected due to the symmetry
    of the correlation matrix.

    The idea of coupled climate networks is based on the concept of coupled
    patterns, for a review refer to [Bretherton1992]_.

    .. note::
       The two observables (layers) need to have the same time grid \
       (temporal sampling points).
