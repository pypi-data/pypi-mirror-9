    Encapsulate a Spearman climate network.

    The Spearman climate network is constructed from the Spearman rank order
    correlation matrix (Spearman's rho). Spearman's rho is more robust with
    respect to ouliers and non-gaussian data distributions than the Pearson
    correlation coefficient used in :class:`TsonisClimateNetwork`.

    Hence, Spearman climate networks are undirected due to the symmetry of the
    Spearman's rho matrix.
