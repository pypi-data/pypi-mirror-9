**Shadow Daemon** is a collection of tools to **detect**, **protocol** and **prevent** **attacks** on *web applications*. Technically speaking, Shadow Daemon is a **web application firewall** that intercepts requests and filters out malicious parameters. It is a modular system that separates web application, analysis and interface to increase security, flexibility and expandability.

This component can be used to connect Python applications with the `background server <https://github.com/zecure/shadowd>`_.
