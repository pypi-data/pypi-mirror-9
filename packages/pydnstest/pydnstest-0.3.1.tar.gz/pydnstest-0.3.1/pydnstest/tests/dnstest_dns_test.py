"""
sanity checks for the upstream DNS package

This class is just a light wrapper around the DNS module.
These tests really only exist to make sure that DNS doesn't
change or break its API without us noticing.

BE WARNED that the DNS lookups used here *may* fail if the author's
hosting setup changes drastically.

The latest version of this package is available at:
<https://github.com/jantman/pydnstest>
