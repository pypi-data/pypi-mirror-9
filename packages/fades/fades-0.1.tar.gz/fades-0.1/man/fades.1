.SH NAME
fades \- FAst DEpendencies for Scripts.


.SH SYNOPSYS
.B fades 
[\fB-v\fR][\fB--verbose\fR]
[\fB-q\fR][\fB--quiet\fR]
[\fB-p\fR \fIversion\fR][\fB--python\fR=\fIversion\fR]

\fBfades\fR can be used to execute directly your script, or put it with a #! at your script's beginning.


.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBfades\fR will automagically create a new virtualenv (or reuse a previous 
created one for your script), installing or updating the necessary 
dependencies, and execute your script inside that virtualenv, with the
only requirement of executing the script with \fBfades\fR and also marking 
the required dependencies. 


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR -v ", "--verbose
Send all internal debugging lines to stderr, which may be very useful if any problem arises.

.TP
.BR -q ", " --quiet
Don't show anything (unless it has a real problem), so the original script stderr is not polluted at all.

.TP
.BR -p " " \fIversion\fR ", " --python=\fIversion\fR
Select which Python version to be used; the argument can be just the number (2.7), the whole name (python2.7) or the whole path (/usr/bin/python2.7).  Of course, the corresponding version of Python needs to be installed in your system.
