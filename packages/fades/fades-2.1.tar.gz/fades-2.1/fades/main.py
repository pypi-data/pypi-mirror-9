Usage:  fades [<fades_options>] child_program [<child_program_options>]

    All fades options are optional:
        -h|--help:    show this help and quit
        -V|--version: show version and info about the system
        -v|--verbose: send all internal debugging lines to stderr, which
                      may be very useful if any problem arises.
        -q|--quiet:   don't show anything (unless it has a real problem),
                      so the original script stderr is not polluted at all.

    The "child program" is the script that fades will execute. It's a
    mandatory parameter, the first thing received by fades that is not
    a parameter.

    The child program options (everything after the child program) are
    parameters passed as is to the child program.

    As fades is a program that executes programs, at first there is the complexity of
    deciding which of the parameters are for fades and which ones are for the executed
    child program. For this, we decided that after fades itself, everything starting with
    a "-" is a parameter for fade, then the rest is for child program.

    Also, it happens that if you pass several parameters to fades when calling it using
    the "!#/usr/bin/fades" magic at the beginning of a file, all the parameters you put
    there come as a single string."""
