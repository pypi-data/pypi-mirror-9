        - Basic text pre-processing pipeline utilities.
        - Utility functions for integration with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com) and [PServer](http://www.pserver-project.org/)
        
        Install
        -------
        
        To install for all users on Unix/Linux:

        Reveal-FP7 Integration
        ----------------------
        (Section under construction.)
        
        Configuration
        -----------
        The package is configured as soon as it is imported.
        
        The local resources and MongoDB configuration is mandatory for the usage of the reveal-user-annotation and [reveal-user-classification](https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/reveal-user-classification) packages.
        
        ### Edit config.txt
        After the installation as described before, one must edit the `.../reveal_user_annotation/config.txt` file:
        
        #### Local Resources
        The relevant field is `DATA_PATH`.
        
        `DATA_PATH`:                The local folder where the package data are stored.
        
        #### MongoDB
        The relevant fields are `mongod_path` and `dbpath`.
        
        `mongod_path`:              The Mongo daemon executable in your local system.
        
        `dbpath`:                   The data folder for the local MongoDB (as it should be in the mongodb.config file).
        
        The above configurations are relevant to a local installation of MongoDB. Such an installation is used to store Twitter data that has been crawled using the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) or intermediate document-type data.
        
        #### PServer
        The relevant fields are `PSERVER_HOST`, `ADMIN_PANEL_USER_NAME`, `ADMIN_PANEL_PASS`, `CLIENT_NAME` and `CLIENT_PASS`.
        
        `PSERVER_HOST`:             The http address where the project PServer instance is located.
        
        `ADMIN_PANEL_USER_NAME`:    PServer administration panel user name.
        
        `ADMIN_PANEL_PASS`:         PServer administration panel password.
        
        `CLIENT_NAME`:              The name of the client to store the data.
        
        `CLIENT_PASS`:              The client password.
        
        #### Twitter
        The relevant fields are `APP_KEY`, `APP_SECRET` and `SCREEN_NAME`.
        
        `APP_KEY`:                  Twitter app key.
        
        `APP_SECRET`:               Twitter app secret.
        
        `SCREEN_NAME`:              The twitter developer account screen name.
        
        One must obviously have created a [Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com/) and have a Twitter developer account.
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        ### Stopwords
        In the `.../reveal_user_annotation/text/res/stopwords/*` folder, there exist several files containing stopwords.
        
        Among them, distributed are the [Google english stopwords](https://code.google.com/p/stop-words/) which are free to use.
