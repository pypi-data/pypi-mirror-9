Description: “GitHub Commander” implements the ``gh`` command line tool,
        which provides a ‘fluent’ interface using Click.
        It allows to access the GitHub API v3 from a shell
        prompt for things usually done in the browser, and also
        automates tasks that otherwise are tedious at best,
        when done by clicking around on a web page.
