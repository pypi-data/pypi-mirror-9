“GitHub Commander” implements the ``gh`` command line tool,
which provides a ‘fluent’ interface using Click.
It allows to access the GitHub API v3 from a shell
prompt for things usually done in the browser, and also
automates tasks that otherwise are tedious at best,
when done by clicking around on a web page.
