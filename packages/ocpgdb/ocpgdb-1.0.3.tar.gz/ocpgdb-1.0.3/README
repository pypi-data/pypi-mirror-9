Requires:
    Python >= 2.3
    PostgreSQL >= 8.1

Optional:
    mx.DateTime >= 3.0.0

Caveats:

    Type casting often needs to be explicit. For example, if you have a
    "timestamp" column "bah", the following query works with adapters
    that use the old libpq protocol, but does not work with adapters
    that use protocol 3:

        curs.execute('SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bah > %s', '2006-1-1')

    Alternatives include using a more appropriate type:

        curs.execute('SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bah > %s', datetime.datime(2006,1,1))

    Or adding an explicit SQL typecast:

        curs.execute('SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bah > %s::timestamp', '2006-1-1')
