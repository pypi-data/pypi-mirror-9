=============
Django Outbox
=============

Capture all mails sent and show it in a simple web interface.

Quick Start
-----------

Install the package in your environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install django-outbox

Configure your django development settings file to use file based email backend:

.. code-block:: python

  from os import path

  EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend'
  EMAIL_FILE_PATH = path.join(ROOT_PATH, 'tmp', 'app-mails')

Also add django_outbox to your installed apps:

.. code-block:: python

  INSTALLED_APPS += (
    'django_outbox',
  )

Add the django outbox url to your urls.py:

.. code-block:: python

  # urls.py
  from django.conf import settings

  # This will prevent from showing the outbox in production. The outbox
  # will only be available when the DEBUG setting is true.
  if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        url(r'^outbox/', include('django_outbox.urls')),
    ) 

Now just run your application in **debug** mode and access */outbox*. All should be working!
