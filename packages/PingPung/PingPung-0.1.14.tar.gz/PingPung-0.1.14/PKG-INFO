Description: PingPung is intended to fill the niche of a truly multiplatform graphical ping application.  Unlike other desktop ping utilities, it does NOT use your operating system's builtin 'ping' program at all.  Instead, it uses a pure Python 3 library which creates its own socket.  **Because of this, it will require root privileges on many platforms.** If you're uncomfortable with that, there are many other platform-specific graphical ping apps out there which do not require root (because they're just wrappers around the OS's existing ping util).
