Description: IBM MQ Light Python module
        ==========================
        
        MQ Light is designed to allow applications to exchange discrete pieces of
        information in the form of messages. This might sound a lot like TCP/IP
        networking, and MQ Light does use TCP/IP under the covers, but MQ Light takes
        away much of the complexity and provides a higher level set of abstractions to
        build your applications with.
        
        This python module provides the high-level API by which you can interact
        with the MQ Light runtime.
