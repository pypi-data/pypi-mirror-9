IBM MQ Light Python module
==========================

MQ Light is designed to allow applications to exchange discrete pieces of
information in the form of messages. This might sound a lot like TCP/IP
networking, and MQ Light does use TCP/IP under the covers, but MQ Light takes
away much of the complexity and provides a higher level set of abstractions to
build your applications with.

This python module provides the high-level API by which you can interact
with the MQ Light runtime.

See https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/mq-light/ for more details.
