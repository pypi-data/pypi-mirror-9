Description: 
        Lrparsing provides both an LR(1) parser and a
        tokeniser.  It differs from other Python LR(1) parsers in
        using Python expressions as grammars, and offers simple to use
        disambiguation tools.
        
        The result is something that is powerful yet concise.  For simple
        tasks this means it can be thought of as an extension to Python's
        existing re module, used when regular expressions become
        too cumbersome.   For complex tasks lrparsing offers a high speed
        parser (very roughly 25us per token from string to parse tree
        on a desktop CPU), pre-compilation of the grammar and error recovery
        hooks so parsing can continue after an error is found.
        
        In addition to extensive documentation it comes with a parser for
        Sqlite3 data manipulation statements and a Lua 5.2 to Python
        compiler as examples.  The documentation can be read online at
        http://lrparsing.sourceforge.net/doc/html/.
