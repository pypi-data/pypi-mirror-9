Introduction
============

Jython-Swingutils is a collection of utility classes and functions that are
designed to make creating `Swing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29>`_
apps on `Jython <http://www.jython.org/>`_ easier.

The library is divided into sections based on the area of Swing it helps with.
Developers are encouraged to take peeks into each individual section and check
out how they can help in the process of building Swing apps in Python. You
should also check out the
`examples <http://bitbucket.org/agronholm/jython-swingutils/src/tip/examples/>`_
directory (not included in the downloadable packages) for practical
demonstrations.
