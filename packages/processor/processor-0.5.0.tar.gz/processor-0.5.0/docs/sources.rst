.. _full list of sources:

mix
====

This is a helper to mix data objects from two or more sources into one stream.
When mixed, dataobjects are interleaved. For example::

  >>> from processor import sources
  >>> source1 = [1,2,3]
  >>> source2 = [5,6,7,8]
  >>> print(list(sources.mix(source1, source2)))
  
  [1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 8]

Mix source iterates through each given source until it raises StopIteration.
That means, if you'll give it an infinite sources like a `web.hook`_, then
resulting source also will be infinite.

imap
====

Imap source is able to read new emails from specified folder on IMAP server.
All you need is to specify server's address, optional port and user credentials:

Example::

  from processor import run_pipeline, source, outputs
  run_pipeline(
      sources.imap("imap.gmail.com",
                            "username",
                            "****word",
                            "Inbox"),
      outputs.debug())

This script will read ``Inbox`` folder at server ``imap.gmail.com``
and print resulting dicts to the terminal's screen.

twitter
=======

.. Note::
   To use this source, you need to obtain an access token from twitter.
   There is a detailed instruction how to do this `Twitter's documentation`_.
   You could encapsulate twitter credentials into a dict2::

      twitter_creds = dict(consumer_key='***', consumer_secret='***',
                           access_token='***', access_secret='***')
      sources.twitter.search('Some query', **twitter_creds)
      sources.twitter.followers(**twitter_creds)

twitter.search
--------------

This source runs search by given query in Twitter and returns fresh
results::

  from processor import run_pipeline, source, outputs
  run_pipeline(
      sources.twitter.search('iOS release notes', **twitter_creds),
      outputs.debug())

It returns following fields:

source
    twitter.search
type
    twitter.tweet
*other*
    Other fields are same as them returns Twitter API. See section "Example Result" at twitter's docs on `search/tweets`_.

twitter.followers
-----------------

First invocation returns all who you follows, each next -- only new followers::

  from processor import run_pipeline, source, outputs
  run_pipeline(
      sources.twitter.followers(**twitter_creds),
      outputs.debug())


It returns following fields:

source
    twitter.followers
type
    twitter.user
*other*
    Other fields are same as them returns Twitter API. See section "Example Result" at twitter's docs on `followers/list`_.

web.hook
========

This source starts a webserver which listens on a given interface and port.
All GET and POST requests are transformed into the data objects.

Configuration example::
  
  run_pipeline(sources.web.hook(host='0.0.0.0', port=1999),
               outputs.debug())

By default, it starts on ``localhost:8000``, but in this case on
``0.0.0.0:1999``.

Here is example of data objects, produced by this source when somebody
posts JSON::

  {'data': {'some-value': 0},
   'headers': {'Accept': 'application/json',
     'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate',
     'Connection': 'keep-alive',
     'Content-Length': '17',
     'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
     'Host': '127.0.0.1:1999',
     'User-Agent': 'HTTPie/0.8.0'},
   'method': 'POST',
   'path': '/the-hook',
   'query': {'query': ['var']},
   'source': 'web.hook',
   'type': 'http-request'}


This source returns data objects with following fields:

source
    web.hook
type
    http-request
method
    GET or POST
path
    Resource path without query arguments
query
    Query arguments
headers
    A headers dictionary. Please, note, this is usual dictionary with case sensitive keys.
data
    Request data, if this was a POST, None for GET. If requests has ``application/json`` content type, then
    data decoded automatically into the python representation. For other content types, if there is
    charset part, then data is decoded from bytes into a string, otherwise, it remains as bytes.


.. Note::
   This source runs in blocking mode. This means it blocks ``run_pipeline`` execution until somebody interupt it.

   No other sources could be processed together with ``web.hook``.
