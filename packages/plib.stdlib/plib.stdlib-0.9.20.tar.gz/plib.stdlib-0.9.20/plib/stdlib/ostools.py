This module contains utilities similar to those provided
in the standard library ``os`` module.

Utility functions currently provided:

iterfile -- generator that can be used in place of
    ``for line in file`` in cases (such as when stdin is
    the file) where Python's line buffering might mean
    the program doesn't get the lines one at a time as
    they come, but in bunches. See
    
    http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/FileIteratorProblems
    
    for a discussion of this issue and the author's code
    for a function that fixes it. We use a simpler
    implementation here because testing has shown that
    it is functionally equivalent to the author's.
    
    Note that the issue can also arise, as the blog entry
    notes, with line-oriented network protocols, which
    means any time you are using a "file-like object"
    derived from a socket.

tmp_chdir -- context manager that changes to a given directory
    temporarily, then changes back to the old current directory
    when it exits.

locate -- generator that yields all filenames starting at a
    root location (by default, the current directory) that match
    a given pattern.

subdirs -- generator that yields all subdirectories of the
    given path (by default, the current directory).

dirfinder -- generator that yields all directories starting at a
    root location (by default, the current directory) that have
    a subdirectory whose name is in a given set of names.

filefinder -- generator that yields all directories starting at a
    root location (by default, the current directory) that contain
    a file whose name is in a given set of names.

data_changed -- checks if data is changed from file data at path.
    Data comparison is done as binary (sequence of bytes).
