Module THREADWRAPPER -- Child Thread Wrapper Object
Sub-Package STDLIB.COMM of Package PLIB -- General Python Utilities
Copyright (C) 2008-2014 by Peter A. Donis

This module contains the ``ThreadWrapper`` class, which provides
a portable interface to child threads and their exit status.
This class is used by the specialized threading functions in this
library.
