This module adds some functions to the Python builtin
namespace. Importing the module is sufficient; no other
code is needed. However, the extra functions also appear
in this module's namespace, so if you want to be more
explicit about what's happening, you can say, for example,

    ``from plib.stdlib.builtins import first``

instead of

    ``import plib.stdlib.builtins``

which makes it less obvious where the function ``first``
is coming from.
