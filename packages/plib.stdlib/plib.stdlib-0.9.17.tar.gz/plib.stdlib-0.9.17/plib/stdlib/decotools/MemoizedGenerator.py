A wrapper class for generators that "memoizes" them, so that even
if the generator is realized multiple times, each term only gets
computed once (after that the result is simply returned from a
cache).

Functional programming types will note that this implementation
is done using a class, not a function. Doing it as a function in
Python would require some inelegant hacks with mutable containers
since Python does not allow a closure's inner function to mutate
variables in the closure's outer function. (Python 2.7 adds the
``nonlocal`` keyword to allow such behavior, but I didn't want to
require 2.7 for this since many Linux distributions are still at
2.6 as of this writing.) Lisp hackers will of course make smug
comments on this limitation of Python's, but I don't care. :-)

class MemoizedGenerator(object):
    """Memoize a generator to avoid computing any term more than once.
    
    Generic implementation of a "memoized" generator for cases where each
    term of the generator is expensive to compute, but it is known that
    every realization of the generator will compute the same terms. This
    class allows multiple realizations of the generator to share a
    single computation of each term.
    
    This class can be used to wrap a generator directly, but it only
    works for ordinary functions (i.e., not methods). For ease of use
    and flexibility, it is recommended that the ``memoize_generator``
    decorator be used instead, since that automatically handles both
    ordinary functions and methods.
    
    Note that, to handle the case of generators with arguments, we
    memoize separately for each distinct set of arguments; we assume
    that each distinct argument set represents a distinct realization
    of the generator with potentially different terms, but that if the
    generator is called multiple times with the same arguments, the
    terms will be the same each time.
    
    Note also that this class is *not* thread-safe; it assumes that all
    realizations of the memoized generator run in the same thread,
    so that it is guaranteed that no more than one realization will
    be mutating the memoization fields at a time.
