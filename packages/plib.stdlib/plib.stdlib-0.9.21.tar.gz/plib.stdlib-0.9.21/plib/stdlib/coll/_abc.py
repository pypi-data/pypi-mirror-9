    ``__getitem__`` methods (they may also override the ``__len__``
    and ``__contains__`` methods if faster implementations are

    depends on ``__getitem__`` to determine if an index is valid;
    however, the check made here is not perfect for slice arguments,

    It may also be advantageous to reimplement ``__iter__`` if a more efficient
    method of iterating through the underlying data structure exists (this will
    depend on how expensive the ``__getitem__`` call is vs. the reimplemented
    iterator), ``__contains__`` if a more efficient membership test exists, and
    ``__len__`` if a more efficient way of obtaining the sequence length exists.
    Finally, note that ``sort`` is not implemented in this class, since duplicating
