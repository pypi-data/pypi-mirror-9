Introduction
============

pySMT makes working with Satisfiability Modulo Theory simple.
Among others, you can:

* Define formulae in a solver independent way
* Perform quantifier elimination
* Write ad-hoc simplifiers and operators

The API is inspired by the great python bindings offered by Z3, but
does not tie you to a particular solver. The aim of this library is to
be an intermediate step between the SMT-LIB (that is unversal but not
programmable) and solvers API (that are programmable, but specific).

The project is still in its infancy, please let us know of any problem
or possible improvements.
