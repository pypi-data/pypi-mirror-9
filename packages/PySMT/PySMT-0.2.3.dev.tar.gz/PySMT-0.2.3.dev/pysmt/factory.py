"""Factories are used to build new Solvers or Quantifier Eliminators
without the need of specifying them. For example, the user can simply
require a Solver that is able to deal with quantified theories, and
the factory will return one such solver among the available ones.
This makes it possible to write algorithms that do not depend on a
particular solver.
