Description: NeurAL - a neuroimaging analysis library

        This library contains helper functions for doing analyses on fMRI data in Python.
        
        In comparison to other Python libraries designed to interact with fMRI data
        (e.g., NIPY and PyNIfTI), this library is not intended to interact directly with
        the data in any way, just to provide helpful wrapper functions and shortcut methods to
        make your life easier.
        
        Since the author uses primarily AFNI, most of the functions are written that way, 
        but don't specifically have to be that way...
