pwkit: miscellaneous Python for science and astronomy
*****************************************************

This is a collection of Peter Williams’ miscellaneous Python tools. I’m
packaging them so that other people can install them off of PyPI and run my
code without having to go to too much work. That’s the hope, at least.


============
Installation
============

The most recent stable version is available on the `Python package index`_, so
you should be able to install this package simply by running ``pip install
pwkit``. The package is also available in the `conda`_ package manager by
installing it from `binstar.org`_.

If you want to download the source code and install ``pwkit`` manually, the
package uses the standard Python `setuptools`_, so running ``python setup.py
install`` will do the trick.

Authors
=======

Peter K. G. Williams and collaborators. Despite this package being named after
me, contributions are welcome and will be given full credit. I just don’t want
to have to make up a decent name for this package right now.

Contributions have come from (alphabetically by surname):

* Maïca Clavel
* Elisabeth Newton
* Denis Ryzhkov (I copied `method_decorator`_)
