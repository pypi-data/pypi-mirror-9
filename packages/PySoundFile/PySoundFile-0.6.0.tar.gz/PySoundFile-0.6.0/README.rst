PySoundFile
===========

`PySoundFile <https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundFile>`__ is an audio
library based on libsndfile, CFFI and Numpy. Full documentation is
available on `pysoundfile.readthedocs.org
<http://pysoundfile.readthedocs.org/>`__.

PySoundFile can read and write sound files. File reading/writing is
supported through `libsndfile <http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/>`__,
which is a free, cross-platform, open-source (LGPL) library for reading
and writing many different sampled sound file formats that runs on many
platforms including Windows, OS X, and Unix. It is accessed through
`CFFI <http://cffi.readthedocs.org/>`__, which is a foreign function
interface for Python calling C code. CFFI is supported for CPython 2.6+,
3.x and PyPy 2.0+. PySoundFile represents audio data as NumPy arrays.

Breaking Changes
----------------

The latest release of PySoundFile cleans up many small
inconsistencies, particularly in the the ordering and naming of
function arguments. Therefore, old code will probably not work any
more.

It also adds a number of great new features, such as global ``read``
and ``write`` functions that do not require you to open a
``SoundFile``, or a ``blocks`` function that can read a sound file one
block at a time. It has also grown a lot more flexible and powerful at
opening things like streams, buffers, or file descriptors.

With all these improvements, we feel that the indexing interface is
not needed any more. It is now officially marked as deprecated and
might be removed in the future.

Installation
------------

PySoundFile depends on the Python packages CFFI and Numpy, and the
system library libsndfile.

To install the Python dependencies, I recommend using the `Anaconda
<http://continuum.io/downloads#34>`__ Distribution of Python. Anaconda
provides the ``conda`` package manager, which will install all
dependencies using ``conda install cffi numpy`` (conda is also
independently available on pip).

You will also need to install `libsndfile
<http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/>`__. On Windows, libsndfile is
included in the binary installers (see below). On OS X, `homebrew
<http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/>`__ can install libsndfile using
``brew install libsndfile``. On Linux, use your distribution's package
manager, for example ``sudo apt-get install libsndfile``.

With CFFI, Numpy, and libsndfile installed, you can use `pip
<http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html>`__ to install
`PySoundFile <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PySoundFile/0.6.0>`__ with
``pip install pysoundfile`` or ``pip install pysoundfile --user`` if you
don't have administrator privileges. If you are running Windows you
should download the Windows installers for PySoundFile instead (which
also include libsndfile):

| `PySoundFile-0.6.0.win-amd64-py2.7 <https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundFile/releases/download/0.6.0/PySoundFile-0.6.0.win-amd64-py2.7.exe>`__
| `PySoundFile-0.6.0.win-amd64-py3.4 <https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundFile/releases/download/0.6.0/PySoundFile-0.6.0.win-amd64-py3.4.exe>`__
| `PySoundFile-0.6.0.win32-py2.7 <https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundFile/releases/download/0.6.0/PySoundFile-0.6.0.win32-py2.7.exe>`__
| `PySoundFile-0.6.0.win32-py3.4 <https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundFile/releases/download/0.6.0/PySoundFile-0.6.0.win32-py3.4.exe>`__

Read/Write Functions
--------------------

Data can be written to the file using ``write()``, or read from the file
using ``read()``. PySoundFile can open all file formats that `libsndfile
supports <http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Features>`__, for example
WAV, FLAC, OGG and MAT files.

Here is an example for a program that reads a wave file and copies it
into an ogg-vorbis file:

.. code:: python

    import pysoundfile as sf

    data, samplerate = sf.read('existing_file.wav')
    sf.write(data, 'new_file.ogg', samplerate=samplerate)

Block Processing
----------------

Sound files can also be read in short, optionally overlapping blocks.
For example, this calculates the signal level for each block of a long
file:

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   import pysoundfile as sf

   rms = [np.sqrt(np.mean(block**2)) for block in
          sf.blocks('myfile.wav', blocksize=1024, overlap=512)]

SoundFile Objects
-----------------

Sound files can also be opened as SoundFile objects. Every SoundFile
has a specific sample rate, data format and a set number of channels.

If a file is opened, it is kept open for as long as the SoundFile
object exists. The file closes when the object is garbage collected,
but you should use the ``close()`` method or the context manager to
close the file explicitly:

.. code:: python

   import pysoundfile as sf

   with sf.SoundFile('myfile.wav', 'rw') as f:
       while f.tell() < len(f):
           pos = f.tell()
           data = f.read(1024)
           f.seek(pos)
           f.write(data*2)

All data access uses frames as index. A frame is one discrete time-step
in the sound file. Every frame contains as many samples as there are
channels in the file.

RAW Files
---------

Pysoundfile can usually auto-detect the file type of sound files. This
is not possible for RAW files, though. This is a useful idiom for
opening RAW files without having to provide all the format for every
file:

.. code:: python

   import pysoundfile as sf

   format = {'format':'RAW', 'subtype':'FLOAT', 'endian':'FILE'}
   data = sf.read('myfile.raw', dtype='float32', **format)
   sf.write(data, 'otherfile.raw', **format)

Virtual IO
----------

If you have an open file-like object, Pysoundfile can open it just like
regular files:

.. code:: python

    import pysoundfile as sf
    with open('filename.flac', 'rb') as f:
        data, samplerate = sf.read(f)

Here is an example using an HTTP request:

.. code:: python

    from io import BytesIO
    import pysoundfile as sf
    import requests

    f = BytesIO()
    response = requests.get('http://www.example.com/my.flac', stream=True)
    for data in response.iter_content(4096):
        if data:
            f.write(data)
    f.seek(0)
    data, samplerate = sf.read(f)

Accessing File Metadata
-----------------------

In addition to audio data, there are a number of text fields in some
sound files. In particular, you can set a title, a copyright notice, a
software description, the artist name, a comment, a date, the album
name, a license, a track number and a genre. Note however, that not
all of these fields are supported for every file format.
