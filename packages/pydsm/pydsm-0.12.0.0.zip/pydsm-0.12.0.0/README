PyDSM
=====

This is a Python/Scipy toolbox for the design and simulation of
ΔΣ Modulators, with emphasis on digital modulators.

Currently, it focuses on tools for the design of the modulator NTF. It
also includes a fast simulator for digital modulators. Furthermore, it
includes a Python/Scipy port of some functions from the `DELSIG
toolbox

by R. Schreier.

As a highlight, the code includes an original NTF design technique
fully described in the papers:
