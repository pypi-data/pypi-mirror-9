Description: ReproZip
        ========
        
        `ReproZip <http://vida-nyu.github.io/reprozip/>`__ is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible
        experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator
        in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a package
        that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given
        command on the author's computational environment (packing step).
        A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).
