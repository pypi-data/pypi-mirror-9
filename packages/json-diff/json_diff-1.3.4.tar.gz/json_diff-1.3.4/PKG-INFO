Description: 
        Compares two JSON files (http://json.org) and generates a new JSON file
        with the result. Allows exclusion of some keys from the comparison, or
        in other way to include only some keys.
        
        The project’s website is at https://fedorahosted.org/json_diff/
        Patches and pull requests are welcome, but please keep the script compatible
        with python 2.4.

        Changelog:
        ==========
        
        1.3.3 2012-04-24
         * Grrr, python 2.4 doesn't have context managers
        
        1.3.2 2012-04-24
         * Include mising test/__init__.py to the distribution to allow
           tests for packgaging.
        
        1.3.1 2012-04-23
         * Back to the past: previous version was not compatible with Python 2.4.
        
        1.3.0 2012-04-23
         * Added -o parameter for output to the specified file.
        
        1.2.9 2012-02-13
         * Give up on non-UTF-8 encoding for output.
        
        1.2.7 2012-01-18
         * Yet another (hopefully the last) fix of the development website. We are on fedorahosted.org now.
        
        1.2.6 2012-01-18
         * Move tests to test/ module
         * Clean up setup.py (when using defaults, install doesn’t install tests,
           which I like)
         * Add new setup.py command test to run the test suite.
        
        1.2.5 2012-01-11
         * Switch the project’s website and clean up UTF-8 metadata.
        
        1.2.1 2011-12-03
         * Change of the home URL to my trac.
        
        1.2.0 2011-12-01
         * One more python 2.4 compatibility fix.
            Maintainer of optparse library couldn't have a better idea than to change
            "usage:" to "Usage:" (between 2.4 and 2.6)! Grrrrrrr.
        
        1.2.0 2011-12-01
         * Fix locale.setlocale to work on RHEL 5.
        
        1.2.0 2011-11-30
         * Make tests working independently of the locale set on the system.
        
        1.2.0 2011-11-30
         * Set exit status of json_diff command.
            0 means no difference
            1 there is a difference.
         * Now actually works correctly with non-mandatory options.
        
        1.1.0 2011-11-29
         * Make scripts pylint and PEP8 compliant.
         * Add option -a to ignore appended keys (for comparing changing piglit tests).
         * Fix formatted output to stdout (or file).
         * Added test for -i functionality.
