pyuv is a Python module which provides an interface to libuv.
`libuv <http://github.com/libuv/libuv>`_ is a high performance
asynchronous networking and platform abstraction library.

libuv is built on top of epoll/kequeue/event ports/etc on Unix and
IOCP on Windows systems providing a consistent API on top of them.

pyuv's features:

- Non-blocking TCP sockets
- Non-blocking named pipes
- UDP support (including multicast)
- Timers
- Child process spawning
- Asynchronous DNS resolution (getaddrinfo)
- Asynchronous file system APIs
- High resolution time
- System memory information
- System CPUs information
- Network interfaces information
- Thread pool scheduling
- ANSI escape code controlled TTY
- File system events (inotify style and stat based)
- IPC and TCP socket sharing between processes
- Arbitrary file descriptor polling
- Thread synchronization primitives

Building
========

Get the source:

::

    git clone https://github.com/saghul/pyuv


Linux:

    ./build_inplace

Mac OSX:

::

    (XCode needs to be installed)
    export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"
    ./build_inplace

Microsoft Windows (with Visual Studio):

::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace


Running the test suite
======================

There are several ways of running the test ruite:

- Run the test with the current Python interpreter:

  From the toplevel directory, run: ``nosetests -v``

- Use Tox to run the test suite in several virtualenvs with several interpreters

  From the toplevel directory, run: ``tox`` this will run the test suite
  on Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4 (you'll need to have them installed beforehand)
