“Tablemate” is an easy-to-use Python package that takes tabular data
and pretty-prints it to the console, with Unicode or ASCII borders
and colors. There is a strict division between data and styling, and
the table layout takes account of the terminal geometry automatically.

Besides producing fancy terminal output, the data can also be converted
into the usual serialization formats, and markup languages like html,
reStructuredText and markdown.

With a static table layout, streaming is possible.
