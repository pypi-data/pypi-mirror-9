# This is the base class that gets built up into a model by addition of functions.
# A description of how this process works can be found here:
#    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/972/adding-a-method-to-an-existing-object

# Todo:
# - the __doc__ attribute isn't something that you can call, need to rework it, along with the __str_ method
# it would be nice to dynamically generate the docstring (or some sortof 'help' string)
# so that if the model is modified, the user can see the current state of modifications

    This is a template class to be subclassed and fleshed out by the translation tools.
    The state dictionary should be expanded to include all of the model stocks.
    
    A function should be added for every flow or auxiliary variable, having the name of that 
    variable, taking no parameters, which calculates the value of the variable.
    
    A function should be added for each stock called d<stockname>_dt() which calculates
    the net inflow to the stock as a function of the flows.
    
    A function should be added for each stock called <stockname>_init() which calculates
    the (potentially dynamically generated) initial value for the stock.
    
    
    
    This docstring will be rewritten and dynamically generated.
