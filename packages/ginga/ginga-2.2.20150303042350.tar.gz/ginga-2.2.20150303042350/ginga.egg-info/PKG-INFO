Description: GINGA ABOUT
        -----------
        Ginga is a toolkit designed for building viewers for scientific image
        data in Python, visualizing 2D pixel data in numpy arrays.  
        It can view astronomical data such as contained in files based on the
        FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) file format.  It is written and
        is maintained by software engineers at the Subaru Telescope, National
        Astronomical Observatory of Japan.
        
        The Ginga toolkit centers around an image display object which supports 
        zooming and panning, color and intensity mapping, a choice of several
        automatic cut levels algorithms and canvases for plotting scalable
        geometric forms.  In addition to this widget, a general purpose
        "reference" FITS viewer is provided, based on a plugin framework.
        A fairly complete set of "standard" plugins are provided for features
        that we expect from a modern FITS viewer: panning and zooming windows,
        star catalog access, cuts, star pick/fwhm, thumbnails, etc.

        BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
        -------------------------
        Ginga uses a standard distutils based install, e.g.
        
            $ python setup.py build
        
        or
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        The program can then be run using the command "ginga"
        
        For further information please see the detailed installation
        instructions in the documentation.

        ETYMOLOGY
        ---------
        "Ginga" is the romanized spelling of the Japanese word "銀河"
        (hiragana: ぎんが), meaning "galaxy" (in general) and, more familiarly,
        the Milky Way.  This viewer was written by software engineers at Subaru
        Telescope, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan--thus the
        connection. 
        
        Pronunciation
        -------------
        Ginga the viewer may be pronounced "ging-ga" (proper japanese) or
        "jing-ga" (perhaps easier for western tongues). The latter pronunciation
        has meaning in the Brazilian dance/martial art capoeira: a fundamental
        rocking or back and forth swinging motion.  Pronounciation as "jin-ja"
        is considered poor form.
