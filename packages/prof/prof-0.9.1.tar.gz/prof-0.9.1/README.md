It ask for an id (you guessed it, the number printed in front of the work title)

    id? 95
    filename? test.tar.gz

If the file is a ``tar.gz``, it will untar it in a temporary directory, and try to compile the project using ``make``. You can override this comportement with ``--compil-command "cmake"`` or ``--no-compile``

    Running make in /tmp/tmp3n3knca6prof for file test.tar.gz
    mkdir -p bin
    gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic -m32 -g   -c -o src/mkhd.o src/mkhd.c
    gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic -m32 -g -o ./lib/mkhd.o -c src/mkhd.c -I./include
    Successfully compiled

And it is done

    done, you should verify the upload on the website

prof is still under devel, it may crash, loose your files, eat your goat.
Always check your file is actually send on the remote server.

[PROF]: https://prof.fil.univ-lille1.fr

## Fast setup

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip

Or whatever your package manager is and how it named ``pip`` for python3

    sudo pip3 install requests
    git clone https://github.com/calve/prof.git
    cd prof
    python3 prof/prof.py

## Download & Execute

To download latests source and run the software

    git clone https://github.com/calve/prof.git
    cd prof
    python3 prof/prof.py

## Requirements

 * python3
 * python3-requests

You can get requests with ``sudo pip install requests``

## Configuration

To get a usable global command, add to your ``~/.bashrc`` file

    alias prof=python3 /path/to/prof/prof/prof.py``

Alternatively, create a ``prof`` file somewhere in your ``$PATH`` containing

    python3 ~/path/to/prof/prof/prof.py "$@"

If you do not want to get prompted everytime for your credentials, put them in environments variables ``PROF_LOGIN`` and/or ``PROF_PASSWORD``.
Add this line to your ``~/.bashrc``

    export PROF_LOGIN=yourlogin

prof will ask you if one of them is missing.

## Set up a post commit hook for git

You can easily setup a postcommit hook for git, so it compile and upload your work on each commit.
In your project, create ``.git/post-commit``

    git archive --output archive.tar.gz master
    python3 /path/to/prof/prof/prof.py --filename archive.tar.gz --login yourlogin -i workid --compil-command "make"

and ``chmod +x .git/post-commit``

## CHANGELOG

 - Check proper compilation before pushing
 - ``--sorted`` option came back
 - Rewrite in Python
 - Better ui, now loop thru tp and ue list
 - Fix : Date comparaison
 - Added argument --sorted to list all TPs sorted by time. Still experimental
 - QuickFix : Clear buffer containing downloaded pages before getting TP list
 - TPs contains their UE
 - TPs contains their deadline. Maybe in a future we could sort TP by deadline
 - TPs and UEs numbers are now from 0 to n, and not the actual id on the server
 - raise exception when procedures fail
 - upload a file
 - delete a remote file
 - retrieve TP list
 - connect to the prof website, get cookie, log and retrieve an UE list

## TODO

  - Improve ui and cli
  - Validate archive before upload
  - Get informations about a repo (the administrator, ...)

Bugs, patches and suggestions are welcome !

## Last word

If nothing work, or if you just want an easy sh script, you may find one in legacy/prof.sh that nearly do the same thing.
