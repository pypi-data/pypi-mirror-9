Changelog
=========

7.6 - (2015-03-17)
------------------
* Change: Switched to curl in the jenkins build install script
  [olimpiurob refs #22402]
* Change: Changed fetch url for jenkins build install script to the install 
  script from the main EEA CPB repository
  [olimpiurob refs #22402]
* Change: added eea.versions.older viewlet with logic that was previously
  within eea.versions.status viewlet about displaying older revisions
  [ichimdav refs #23017]

7.5 - (2014-12-23)
------------------
* Feature: Ajax versioning is now checking if a version isn't already in
  progress in which case no new versioning is attempted until previous version
  call is terminated
  [ichim-david refs #22047]
* Bug fix: Added browserlayer for viewlets, so don't throw error when
  eea.versions is installed but not activated yet.
  [szabozo0]

7.4 - (2014-11-20)
------------------
* Bug fix: Display also archived (expired) versions within versioning viewlet
  for anonymous users.
  [voineali refs #21515]

7.3 - (2014-10-15)
------------------
* Upgrade step: run SITE/@@updateCreationDate
  [ichim-david refs #21326]
* Feature: added updateCreationDate BrowserView which will set the CreationDate
  to that of the EffectiveDate if the CreationDate is smaller than the
  EffectiveDate
  [ichim-david refs #21326]
* Change: order of versions no longer takes into consideration that
  effective_date needs to be older than the creation date, opting to sort
  by effective_date if that is found on the object.
  This reverts the logic change done in ticket 20827
  [ichim-david refs #21326]
* Bug fix: user must be able to create a new version with Add Portal
  Content permission. Semantically creating new versions means adding new
  content to the site. This way users can create new versions of published
  content which it may be not editable anymore.
  [demarant refs #21369]

7.2 - (2014-09-15)
------------------
* Bug fix: check if effective_date isn't smaller than that of the creation_date
  when returning the versions of an object and if so sort by creation_date
  since the order of the versions determine which is latest version
  [ichimdav refs #20827]

7.1 - (2014-07-15)
------------------
* Bug fix: fixed permission for @@can_version, it is now set to zope2.View

------------------

  anonymous users
  [ichim-david refs #18155]
* Change: creating a version now sets the currently logged in user as the
  creator of the object while also preserving the previous creators
