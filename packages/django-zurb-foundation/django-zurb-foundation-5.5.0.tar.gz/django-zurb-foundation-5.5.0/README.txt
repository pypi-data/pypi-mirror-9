django-zurb-foundation 5.5.0
============================

Django Zurb Foundation 5 package.

Version of this package is equal to the version of Zurb Foundation it provides.

Usage
=====

- Add `foundation` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
- If you want to use the provided base template, extend from `foundation/base.html`. If you want to write one from scratch, see the example template.
- If you want to test if foundation works, include `foundation.urls` in your urls.py and visit the path. You should see the Foundation test page.

Including Foundation js/css/vendor files
=============================================

#### Note: these tags are deprecated in favor of including files directly with Django `static` tag. They will be removed in version 6.x. Templates have been updated to use the new method.

To include specific Foundation js files, you can use `foundation_js` tag. 

For example, to include `abide` library use:

    {% foundation_js 'abide' %}

Depending on your static url, it will replace the previous tag with something like `<script src="/static/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.abide.js"></script>`.
Same works for Foundation css and vendor files, but in that case use the `foundation_css` or `foundation_vendor` tag the same way.

Note that if you call `foundation_js` without any parameters, it will include `foundation.min.js` file.

Foundation icons
================

#### Note: this tag is deprecated in favor of including files directly with Django `static` tag. It will be removed in version 6.x. Templates have been updated to use the new method.

The latest Foundation icons set is now included in this package.
The icons are not enabled by default. To enable them use something like this in your template:

    {% block css %}
        {% foundation_css 'foundation-icons' %}
    {% endblock css %}

If you have added `foundation.urls` to your urls.py visit `icons/` on that path to see them.
