          It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships,
          striking from a hidden base, have won their first
          victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During 
          the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret 
          plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, 
          the Death Star, an armored space station 
          with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
          Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, 
          Princess Leia races home aboard her starship,
          custodian of the stolen plans that can save her
          people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
