==============================
 MDAnalysisTestData CHANGELOG
==============================

The rules for this file:
  * entries are sorted newest-first.
  * summarize sets of changes - don't reproduce every subversion log comment here.
  * don't ever delete anything.
  * keep the format consistent (79 char width, M/D/Y date format) and do not
    use tabs but use spaces for formatting	 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/07/2011 orbeckst

  * 0.7.4

    - Split off test data trajectories and structures from
      MDAnalaysis/tests/data into separate package. (Issue 28) 

    - Numbering matches the earliest MDAnalysis release for which the data is
      needed. Any later releases of MDAnalysis will also use these test data
      unless a MDAnalysisTestData package with a higher release number is
      available.
