        (Just) A blog app for Django
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        What is the point of all this? When this project got started blogging
        apps for Django generally fell into one of these categories:
        
        1. A full CMS framework.
        2. A Django App but intended for blog-only sites.
        3. A Django App but intended for either a blog-only site (the default)
           or a site with a blog attached.
        
        Though all three of these categories had great projects to choose from
        any one of them could be frustrating to implement into (and maintain
        within) an existing site. Simply because the app was not directly and
        exclusively focused on the use case of a django site, and a blog (get
        it?).
        
        Andablog has a focus on integration-ease first and features second. So
        if the focus of your Django site is something else and you want to add a
        blog section to it you have come to the right place.

        History
        -------
        
        1.3.0 (2015-03-10)
        ------------------
        Authors are now able to see 'draft' (unpublished) versions of their blog entries.
        Upgraded taggit to address an issue that was locking us to an older Django 1.7 version.
        
        1.2.2 (2014-12-04)
        ------------------
        Fixed a bug where the Django 1.7.x migration for recent DB changes was somehow missed.
        
        1.2.1 (2014-12-02)
        ------------------
        The author is now selectable when editing entries in the admin.
         * The list is limited to superusers and anyone with an andablog Entry permission.
         * The initial value is the current user.
        
        1.1.1 (2014-12-02)
        ------------------
        Fixed a bug where the tags field was required in the admin.
        
        1.1.0 (2014-12-01)
        ------------------
        Blog entries can now have tags
         * The entry model now supports tags by way of the django-taggit package.
         * This affects the model only, there are no template examples or tags.
        
        1.0.0 (2014-11-20)
        ------------------
        **Backwards Incompatible with 0.1.0.**
        This release includes a rename of the django app package from djangoandablog to andablog to better follow
        community conventions. This of course is a very large breaking change, which is why the version is 1.0.
        As this is the second version and we have been out such a short time. My hope is that few if any people
        are using this app yet. If you are, please submit an issue on GitHub and I will try to help you migrate away.
        
        0.1.0 (2014-11-16)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
