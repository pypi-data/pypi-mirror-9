Description: 
        
        seantis.dir.events builds on seantis.dir.base, adding information about
        upcoming events.
        
        seantis.dir.base allows to put dexterity objects into 1-4 categories, showing
        those categories in a browsable and searchable catalog. To learn more about
        seantis.dir.base visit https://github.com/seantis/seantis.dir.base.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        seantis.dir.events relies on Plone 4.3+ with dexterity and seantis.dir.base.
        
        python-magic is used to identify the type of uploaded files which requires the
        'libmagic' library.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        1. Use Plone 4.3 or newer
        
        ::
        
            extends =
                http://dist.plone.org/release/4.3/versions.cfg
        
        2. Add the module to your instance eggs
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                seantis.dir.events
        
        
        3. Ensure that the i18n files are compiled by adding
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            environment-vars =
                ...
                zope_i18n_compile_mo_files true
        
        4. Setup up autoremove and/or import clock servers for one instance (or set up a cron job getting the corresponding views described below).
        
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            environment-vars =
                ...
                seantis_events_cleanup true
                seantis_events_import true
        
        
        5. Install dexterity and seantis.dir.events using portal_quickinstaller
