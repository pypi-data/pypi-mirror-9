# exifyay

Yay, [Exif][exif-wp]! This module provides routines for reading and
**writing** Exif data in Python, backed by strong and time-tested C
libraries.

The bindings are generated by [Cython][cython] and we use static
linking to produce a self-contained Python C module.

## Sources
libexif and libjpeg are based on version 0.6.21. We have removed some
i18n related stuff and added a GPS routine from the same source where
JpegEncoderEXIF comes from.

JpegEncoderEXIF uses libexif and provides a higher-level interface to
set Exif data. We have added a function to unset tags and have extended
the GPS support.

libexif performs the heavy lifting that lets us read and write Exif
data. libjpeg is part of the exif tool closely related to libexif.

libexif and libjpeg use autotools, we use [CMake][cmake] because Simon
could not figure out how to cleanly build static libraries that work
both on OS X and Linux.

## Build
```shell
cmake .
make
python setup.py install
```

To build you must have CMake, make, gcc, g++, Python headers, and
Cython installed.

## Install using pip
You can install exifyay using [pip][pip] but you must still have the
build requirements installed. To create binary distrbutions, you
may want to have a look at [fpm][fpm].

## Check for memory leaks
We use [Valgrind][valgrind] and Python built with `--with-valgrind` on
test scripts and make sure that no directly nor indirectly lost memory
is reported. Possibly lost memory is reported, however, but our sanity
check is to remove all libexif unref calls and such and verify that the
possibly lost memory value is unchanged.

## Correctness
We verify that running the same operations on the same data more than
once do not change it. We also verify that outputs can be parsed with
tools like [ExifTool][exiftool]
