Description: A simple library to download, slice and search NFL game footage on a
        play-by-play basis.
        
        This library comes with preloaded play-by-play meta data, which
        describes the start time of each play in the game footage. However, the
        actual footage does not come with this library and is not released by
        me. This package therefore provides utilities to batch download NFL Game
        Footage from the original source.
        
        Once game footage is downloaded, you can use this library to search
        plays and construct a playlist to play in ``vlc`` with the
        `nflvid.vlc <http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/nflvid/vlc.m.html>`__ submodule.
