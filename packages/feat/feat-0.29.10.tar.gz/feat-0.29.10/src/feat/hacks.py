"""
Because Flumotion is depending heavily on ihooks and relative imports
are not supported in python 2.6 implementation of ihook, it is not possible
to import a root module with the same name as the current module.
This is a probleme for feat's json module because it needs to import
the root json module. This function just import it from inside another
pacakge.
