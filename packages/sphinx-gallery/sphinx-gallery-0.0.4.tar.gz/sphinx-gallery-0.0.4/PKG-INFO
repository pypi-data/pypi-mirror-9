        Sphinx extension for automatic generation of an example gallery.
        It is extracted from the scikit-learn project and aims to be an
        independent general purpose extension.
        
        Getting the package
        ===================
        
        You can do a direct install via pip by using::
        
            $ pip install sphinx-gallery
        
        
        Install as developer
        --------------------
        
        You can get the latest development source from our Github repository.
        You need  ``setuptools`` installed in your system to install.
        
        You will also need have installed:
        
        * Sphinx
        * matplotlib
        * pillow
        * joblib
        
        But if you don't the ``setuptools`` will try to install them for you::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery
            $ cd sphinx-gallery
            $ python setup.py develop
        
        
        Setting up your project
        =======================
        
        After installing you need to include in your Sphinx ``conf.py`` file:
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            extensions = [
                ...
                'sphinxgallery.gen_rst',
                ]
        
            import sphinxgallery
            html_static_path = ['_static', sphinxgallery._path_static()]
        
        
        you need to have a folder called ``examples`` in your main repository directory.
        This folder needs
        
        * A ``README.txt`` file with rst syntax to present your gallery
        * ``plot_examples.py`` files. Python scripts that have to be executed
          and output a plot that will be presented in your gallery
        * ``examples.py`` files. Python scripts that will not be executed but will be presented
          in the gallery
        
        Your python scripts in the examples folder need to have a main comment. Written
        in rst syntax to be used in the generated file in the example gallery.
        
        You can have subfolders in your ``examples`` directory, those will be recursively
        scaned by the gallery extension and presented in the gallery. Subfolder have to
        respect the same structure of the main ``examples`` folder.
        
        If these instructions are not clear enough, this package uses itself, to generated
        its own example gallery. So check the directory structure and the contents of the
        files.
        
        That is all, our module shall take care of the rest.
        Once you build the documentation, our extension will generate a ``auto_examples``
        directory and populate it with rst files containing the gallery and each example.
        Then Sphinx will give this files its regular processing and you can enjoy your
        generated gallery unde the same path.
