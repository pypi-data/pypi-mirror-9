hwrt documentation
==================

hwrt is short for 'handwriting recognition toolkit'. This toolkit allows you
to download on-line handwritten mathematical symbols, view them, analyze them
and train and test models to classify them automatically. The toolset offers
many preprocessing algorithms and features that can be combined in many ways
by YAML configuration files.

The theoretical part is covered in the bachelor's thesis 'On-line Handwriting
Recognition of Mathematical Symbols' from Martin Thoma. One part of this
bachelor's thesis was to create this toolkit and evaluate it.
