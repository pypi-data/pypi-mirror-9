Development
===========

The ``hwrt`` toolkit is developed by Martin Thoma. The development began in
May 2014.

It is developed on GitHub: https://github.com/MartinThoma/hwrt

You can file issues and feature requests there. Alternatively, you can send
me an email: info@martin-thoma.de

Contributions
-------------

Everybody is welcome to contribute to ``hwrt``. You can do so by

* Testing it and giving me feedback / opening issues on GitHub.

  * Writing unittests.

  * Simply using the software.

* Writing new code and sending it to me as pull requests or as email
  (info@martin-thoma.de). However, before you add new functionality you should
  eventually ask if I really want that in the project.

* Improving existing code.

  * Improving the front-end (HTML+CSS+JavaScript)

* Suggesting something else how you can contribute.


I suggest reading the issues page https://github.com/MartinThoma/hwrt/issues
for more ideas how you can contribute.


Tools
-----

* ``nosetests`` for unit testing
* ``pylint`` to find code smug
* GitHub for hosting the source code
* http://hwrt.readthedocs.org/ or https://pythonhosted.org/hwrt for hosting the documentation


Code coverage can be tested with

.. code:: bash

    $ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-erase --cover-package hwrt --logging-level=INFO --cover-html

and uploaded to coveralls.io with

.. code:: bash

    $ coveralls


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is generated with `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/index.html>`_.
On Debian derivates it can be installed with

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python-sphinx
    $ sudo -H pip install numpydoc

Sphinx makes use of `reStructured Text <http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/doc/openalea/doc/_build/html/source/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_

The documentation can be built with ``make html``.

The documentation is written in numpydoc syntax. Information about numpydoc
can be found at the `numpydoc repository <https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc>`_,
especially `A Guide to NumPy/SciPy Documentation <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_.



Project structure
-----------------

The project structure is

::

    .
    ├── bin
    ├── docs
    ├── hwrt
    │   ├── misc
    │   └── templates
    └── tests
        └── symbols


where the folder ``bin`` contains all scripts that can directly be used,
``hwrt`` contains all modules and ``tests`` contains unittests written with
nosetools.

The symbols subfolder contains JSON files of recordings that are used for
testing.


Current State
-------------

* lines of code without tests: LOC
* lines of test code: LOT
* test coverage: cov
* pylint score: lint
