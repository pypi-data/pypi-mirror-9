Description: ## Walrus
        
        Lightweight Python utilities for working with Redis.
        
        ### Containers
        
        Pythonic container objects for working with the primary Redis data-types:
        
        * ``Hash``
        * ``Set``
        * ``ZSet`` (sorted set)
        * ``List``
        * ``Array`` (custom type)
        
        These objects are meant to look and act like their native Python equivalents, except sorted sets, which are kind of their own thing...
        
        ### Cache
        
        Simple cache implementation and caching decorator.
        
        ### Models
        
        Persistent structures implemented on top of Hashes. Supports indexing to allow filtering with equality conditions.
