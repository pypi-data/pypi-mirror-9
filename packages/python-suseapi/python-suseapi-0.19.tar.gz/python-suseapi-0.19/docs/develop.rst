Testsuite
---------

The testsuite can be executed using ``py.test``.

Continuous integration
----------------------

We're using several services to ensure our code is healthy:

Travis CI for running the testsuite
    https://travis-ci.org/nijel/python-suseapi
Coveralls for reporting the testsuite coverage
    https://coveralls.io/r/nijel/python-suseapi?branch=master 
Landscape for checking quality of our code
    https://landscape.io/github/nijel/python-suseapi/master
