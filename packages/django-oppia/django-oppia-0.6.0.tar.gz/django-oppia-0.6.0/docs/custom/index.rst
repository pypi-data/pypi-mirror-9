Customisation
===============

This section describes how you can do some basic customisation to the various 
components of OppiaMobile. Before making any customisations, you should read our 
page on our use of GitHub - this will help you manage you code and take 
advantage subsequent developments, bug fixes and new features implemented in the
OppiaMobile code.

If you need and help or advice in getting set up and running, or any questions
about the platform, then please post on our `OppiaMobile Google Groups forum 
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oppiamobile>`_.
