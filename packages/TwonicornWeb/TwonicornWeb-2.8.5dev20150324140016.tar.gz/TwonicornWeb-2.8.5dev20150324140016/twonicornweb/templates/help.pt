    <h2>API</h2>

    <p>
    The API is used by the clients to get deploy information. All queries return a JSON response. 

    <h3>HTTP GET Examples</h3>

    <p>
      Application:<br>
    <a tal:attributes="href host_url + '/api/application?id=1&env=dev&loc=aws1&lifecycle=current'" tal:content="host_url + '/api/application?id=1&env=dev&loc=aws1&lifecycle=current'">/api</a>
    <p>
      Deploy:<br>
    <a tal:attributes="href host_url + '/api/deploy?id=1&loc=lax1&env=dev&lifecycle=current'" tal:content="host_url + '/api/deploy?id=1&loc=lax1&env=dev&lifecycle=current'">/api</a>
    <p>
      Artifact:<br>
    <a tal:attributes="href host_url + '/api/artifact?id=308&loc=lax1'" tal:content="host_url + '/api/artifact?id=308&loc=lax1'">/api</a>
    <p>
      Configured environments:<br>
    <a tal:attributes="href host_url + '/api/envs'" tal:content="host_url + '/api/envs'">/api</a>
    <p>
      Configured artifact types:<br>
    <a tal:attributes="href host_url + '/api/artifact_types'" tal:content="host_url + '/api/artifact_types'">/api</a>
    <p>
      Configured lifecycles:<br>
    <a tal:attributes="href host_url + '/api/lifecycles'" tal:content="host_url + '/api/lifecycles'">/api</a>
    <p>
      Configured repo urls:<br>
    <a tal:attributes="href host_url + '/api/repo_urls'" tal:content="host_url + '/api/repo_urls'">/api</a>
    <p>
      Configured repo types:<br>
    <a tal:attributes="href host_url + '/api/repo_types'" tal:content="host_url + '/api/repo_types'">/api</a>

    <h3>HTTP PUT Examples</h3>

    <p>
      In order to PUT to the API, you need to authenticate with http basic auth. The username and password are configured in the following application config paramters:
    <p>
    tcw.api_user<br>
    tcw.api_pass<br>

    <p>
      Insertion and assignment of artifacts is handled by the injection script, this documentation is just for completeness.

    <p>
      Insert a new artifact:

    <p>
      telnet twonicorn.mydomain.com 80<br>
      PUT /api/artifact?repo_id=3&location=/twonicorn-test-war-git-conf&revision=abc123&branch=None HTTP/1.1<br>
      Host: twonicorn.mydomain.com<br>
      Authorization: Basic fXBps3VzZXg6Y4JjMDIz <br>

    <p>
      Make an artifact assignment:

    <p>
      telnet twonicorn.mydomain.com 80<br>
      PUT /api/artifact_assignment?deploy_id=3&artifact_id=352&env=dev&updated_by=bandta HTTP/1.1<br>
      Host: twonicorn.mydomain.com<br>
      Authorization: Basic fXBps3VzZXg6Y4JjMDIz<br>
