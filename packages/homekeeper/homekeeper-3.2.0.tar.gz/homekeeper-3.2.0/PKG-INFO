        Homekeeper
        ==========
        NOTE: The format for homekeeper configuration has changed; this change is not
        backwards compatible with the old version.
        
        This project helps organize and dotfiles across multiple (even across multiple
        computers).  It does so by marking a directory as your 'dotfiles directory' and
        then symlinking those files into your HOME directory.
        
        In the event that you use multiple computers and would like dotfiles to be
        shared, you can specify a 'base' dotfiles directory and have host specific
        dotfiles override them.
        
        One benefit of doing this is you can easily version your dotfiles directory with
        the revision control system of your choice.
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        My dotfiles repository is located here if you'd like to take a look:
        
            https://github.com/retiman/dotfiles
        
        How It Works
        ============
        
        Homekeeper will read a `$HOME/.homekeeper.json` file for configuration, or
        create one if it doesn't already exist.  The default configuration looks like
        this:
        
            {
                "base": "/home/$USER/dotfiles/base",
                "directory": "/home/$USER/dotfiles/$HOST",
                "override": true,
                "excludes": [
                    ".git",
                    ".gitignore",
                ],
                "cherrypicks": [
                    ".mplayer/config",
                    ".config/Terminal/terminalrc",
                ],
            }
        
        Homekeeper will not symlink any file in the `excludes` array in the
        configuration.
        
        Homekeeper will symlink files in the base directory first, then override those
        symlinks with files in your normal dotfiles directory.  This can be useful if
        you have different configurations for different machines.
        
        You may have homekeeper generate this file by running `homekeeper init` in the
        directory where you store your dotfiles.
        
        Once homekeeper knows where your dotfiles live, it will remove the dotfile in
        your home directory, and symlink it from your dotfiles directory.  For example,
        if you have a `.bash_profile` in `~/dotfiles`, then your home directory will
        contain:
        
            .bash_profile -> /home/$USER/dotfiles/.bash_profile
        
        NOTE: HOMEKEEPER WILL REMOVE THE ORIGINAL FILE ONCE YOU TELL IT TO SYMLINK.
        
        Make sure you back it up or are having homekeeper track the file you want to
        symlink first.
        
        Tracking
        ========
        
            $ homekeeper track ~/.vimrc
        
        This will copy your `~/.vimrc` file into your dotfiles directory.  The next time
        you run `homekeeper link` the original `~/.vimrc` will be deleted, and the
        tracked version will be symlinked there instead.
        
        If you track a directory, the entire directory and all subdirectories will be
        copied to your dotfiles directory.  You can only track a top level directory.
        For example, if you decide to track:
        
            $ homekeeper track ~/.foo/bar/baz
        
        ...then homekeeper will copy the `baz` directory into your dotfiles directory.
        In order to track all files and directories under `.foo`, track the following:
        
            $ homekeeper track ~/.foo
        
        If you want to track *just* `~/.foo/bar/baz`, see the section about cherrypicks
        below.
        
        Excludes
        ========
        
        Any paths listed in the `excludes` directive in `homekeeper.json` will be
        ignored by homekeeper when linking.  The only exception is if the path is also
        in the `cherrypicks` directive (see below).
        
        Cherry Picks
        ============
        
        This directive tells homekeeper to 'cherry pick' a particular path for linking.
        This is useful if you want to version control a single file, but not the other
        files in the same directory, or any of the parent directories.
        
        Once you have done so, copy the file manually (with the appropriate directory
        structure) into your dotfiles directory.
        
        NOTE: This feature is experimental and may change.
