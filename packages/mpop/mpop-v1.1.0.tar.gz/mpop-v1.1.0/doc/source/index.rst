==================================
 Welcome to MPoP's documentation!
==================================

The Meteorological Post-Processing package is a python library for generating
RGB products for meteorological remote sensing. As such it can create RGB
composites directly from satellite instrument channels, or take advantage of
precomputed PGEs.

Get to the project_ page, with source and downloads.

It is designed to be easily extendable to support any meteorological satellite
by the creation of plugins. In the base distribution, we provide support for
Meteosat 7, 8, 9, MTSAT1R, MTSAT2, GOES 11, GOES 12, GOES 13 through the use of
mipp_, and Noaa 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and Metop A through the use of aapp and
ahamap.

Reprojection of data is also available through the use of pyresample_.
