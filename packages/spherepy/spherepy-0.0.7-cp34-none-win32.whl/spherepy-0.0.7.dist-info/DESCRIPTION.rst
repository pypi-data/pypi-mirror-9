SpherePy
========

SpherePy is a package for working with scalar and vector spherical harmonics.
It provides:

	* scalar and vector spherical harmonic decompositions
	* objects for algebraically manipulating harmonic coefficients
	* the ability to plot coefficients and patterns

**PyPI:**

Note that the 0.0.6 version of the PyPI package you get with pip does not work on Linux, and on Windows it will try to download the latest
NumPy (which you might now want). I'm fixing this issue in 0.0.7 and will hopefully have it up soon.

Better Documentation
--------------------


I'm working on a more complete documentation 
[HERE](http://www.direentech.com/docs/spherepy).


Install
=======

**pip**

For Windows I use wheels to distribute the binaries, so make sure pip is up to date.

**Ubuntu:**
Before installing SpherePy you must install build-essential, python-dev, and NumPy

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev

For NumPy you need to decide if you want to build it yourself with

    $ sudo pip install numpy

or download the package with

    $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy

I have been building NumPy using the pip method, but it takes a long time. 

Then you can 

    $ sudo pip install spherepy

**Windows:**
Make sure you have Numpy on your machine, then

    $ pip install spherepy

Plotting
========

If you would like to use the plotting routines within SpherePy, install matplotlib:

    $ sudo pip install matplotlib

Quick Example
=============

    >>> import spherepy as sp 
    >>> c = sp.random_coefs(4, 4) # generate some random coefficients
    >>> sp.pretty_coefs(c)
    >>> p = sp.ispht(c, 50, 50) # inverse spherical transform to pattern
    >>> sp.plot_sphere_mag(p) # plot the magnitude of the pattern
