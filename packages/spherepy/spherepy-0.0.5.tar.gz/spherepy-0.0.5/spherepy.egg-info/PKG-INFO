Description: SpherePy
        ========
        
        SpherePy is a package for working with scalar and vector spherical harmonics.
        It's capabilities include:
        
        	* scalar and vector spherical harmonic decompositions
        	* objects for algebraically manipulating harmonic coefficients
        	* plotting capabilities using the matplotlib library
        	
        Plotting
        ========
        
        If you would like to use the plotting routines within SpherePy, install matplotlib (example, pip install matplotlib).
