SpherePy
========

SpherePy is a package for working with scalar and vector spherical harmonics.
It provides:

	* scalar and vector spherical harmonic decompositions
	* objects for algebraically manipulating harmonic coefficients
	* the ability to plot coefficients and patterns

Better Documentation
--------------------


I'm working on a more complete documentation 
[HERE](http://www.direentech.com/docs/spherepy).


Install
=======

**pip**

For Windows I use wheels to distribute the binaries, so make sure pip is up to date.

**Ubuntu:**
Before installing SpherePy you must install build-essential, python-dev, and NumPy

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev
    $ sudo pip install numpy

Then you can 

    $ sudo pip install spherepy

**Windows:**
Make sure you have Numpy on your machine, then

    $ pip install spherepy

Plotting
========

If you would like to use the plotting routines within SpherePy, install matplotlib:

    $ sudo pip install matplotlib

Quick Example
=============

    >>> import spherepy as sp 
    >>> c = sp.random_coefs(4, 4) # generate some random coefficients
    >>> p = sp.ispht(c, 50, 50) # inverse spherical transform to pattern
    >>> sp.plot_sphere_mag(p) # plot the magnitude of the pattern
