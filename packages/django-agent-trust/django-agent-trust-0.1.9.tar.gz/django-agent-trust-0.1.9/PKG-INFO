        This project has tools for managing trusted user agents. For example, you might
        allow the user to indicate whether they are using a public or private computer
        and implement different policies for each. Or you might be using a two-factor
        authentication scheme, allowing the users to bypass the second factor on
        machines that they designate as trusted. This uses Django 1.4's signed cookie
        facility and operates independently of sessions.
        
        Short list of features:
        
            - ``request.agent.is_trusted`` tells you whether the request came from a
              trusted agent.
            - APIs to trust or revoke the agent that made a given request.
            - Global, per-user, and per-agent settings can set the duration of agent
              trust as well as an inactivity timeout.
            - Supports session-scoped agent trust for consistency of authorization
              policies.
            - Revoke all of a user's previously trusted agents at any time.
        
        The mechanisms by which a user is allowed to designate trusted agents is left
        entirely to clients of this library. For an application of this API using
        one-time passwords, see `django-otp-agents
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-otp-agents>`_, part of the `django-otp
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-otp>`_ suite.
