################ Sites and site families

    Sites are the vertices of the graph which describes the tight binding

    Parameters
    ----------
    family : an instance of `SiteFamily`
        The 'type' of the site.
    tag : a hashable python object
        The unique identifier of the site within the site family, typically a

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

    Notes
    -----
    For convenience, ``family(*tag)`` can be used instead of ``Site(family,

    The parameters of the constructor (see above) are stored as instance

################ Symmetries

class Symmetry(object):

    Many physical systems possess a discrete spatial symmetry, which results in
    special properties of these systems.  This class is the standard way to
    describe discrete spatial symmetries in Kwant.  An instance of this class
    can be passed to a `Builder` instance at its creation.  The most important
    kind of symmetry is translational symmetry, used to define scattering
    leads.

    Each symmetry has a fundamental domain -- a set of sites and hoppings,
    generating all the possible sites and hoppings upon action of symmetry
    group elements.  A class derived from `Symmetry` has to implement mapping
    of any site or hopping into the fundamental domain, applying a symmetry
    group element to a site or a hopping, and a method `which` to determine the
    group element bringing some site from the fundamental domain to the
    requested one.  Additionally, it has to have a property `num_directions`
    returning the number of independent symmetry group generators (number of
    elementary periods for translational symmetry).

    A ``ValueError`` must be raised by the symmetry class whenever a symmetry
    is used together with sites whose site family is not compatible with it.  A
    typical example of this is when the vector defining a translational
    symmetry is not a lattice vector.

################ Hopping kinds

class HoppingKind(object):

    equal to `delta`.  In other words, the matching hoppings have the form:
    ``(family_a(x + delta), family_b(x))``

    ----------
    delta : Sequence of integers
        The sequence is interpreted as a vector with integer elements.
    family_a : `~kwant.builder.SiteFamily`
    family_b : `~kwant.builder.SiteFamily` or ``None`` (default)

    -----
    A ``HoppingKind`` is a callable object: When called with a
    `~kwant.builder.Builder` as sole argument, an instance of this class will
    return an iterator over all possible matching hoppings whose sites are

class Builder(object):
    """A tight binding system defined on a graph.

    This is one of the central types in Kwant.  It is used to construct tight
    binding systems in a flexible way.

    The nodes of the graph are `Site` instances.  The edges, i.e. the hoppings,
    are pairs (2-tuples) of sites.  Each node and each edge has a value
    associated with it.  The values associated with nodes are interpreted as
    on-site Hamiltonians, the ones associated with edges as hopping integrals.

    To make the graph accessible in a way that is natural within the Python
    language it is exposed as a *mapping* (much like a built-in Python
    dictionary).  Keys are sites or hoppings.  Values are 2d arrays
    (e.g. NumPy or Tinyarray) or numbers (interpreted as 1 by 1 matrices).

    Parameters
    ----------
    symmetry : `Symmetry` or `None`
        The symmetry of the system.

    Notes
    -----
    Values can be also functions that receive the site or the hopping (passed
    to the function as two sites) and possibly additional arguments and are
    expected to return a valid value.  This allows to define systems quickly,
    to modify them without reconstructing, and to save memory for many-orbital
    models.

    In addition to simple keys (single sites and hoppings) more powerful keys
    are possible as well that allow to manipulate multiple sites/hoppings in a
    single operation.  Such keys are internally expanded into a sequence of
    simple keys by using the method `Builder.expand`.  For example,
    ``sys[general_key] = value`` is equivalent to ::

        for simple_key in sys.expand(general_key):
            sys[simple_key] = value

    Builder instances automatically ensure that every hopping is Hermitian, so
    that if ``builder[a, b]`` has been set, there is no need to set
    ``builder[b, a]``.

    Builder instances can be made to automatically respect a `Symmetry` that is
    passed to them during creation.  The behavior of builders with a symmetry
    is slightly more sophisticated.  First of all, it is implicitly assumed
    throughout Kwant that **every** function assigned as a value to a builder
    with a symmetry possesses the same symmetry.  Secondly, all keys are mapped
    to the fundamental domain of the symmetry before storing them.  This may
    produce confusing results when neighbors of a site are queried.

    The method `attach_lead` *works* only if the sites affected by them have
    tags which are sequences of integers.  It *makes sense* only when these
    sites live on a regular lattice, like the ones provided by `kwant.lattice`.

    ``builder0 += builder1`` adds all the sites, hoppings, and leads of
    ``builder1`` to ``builder0``.  Sites and hoppings present in both systems
    are overwritten by those in ``builder1``.  The leads of ``builder1`` are
    appended to the leads of the system being extended.

    .. warning::

        If functions are used to set values in a builder with a symmetry, then
        they must satisfy the same symmetry.  There is (currently) no check and
        wrong results will be the consequence of a misbehaving function.

    Examples
    --------
    Define a site.

    >>> builder[site] = value

    Print the value of a site.

    >>> print builder[site]

    Define a hopping.

        Keys are (recursively):

              expression.
            * Any function that returns a key when passed a builder as sole
              argument, e.g. a `HoppingKind` instance or the function returned
              by `~kwant.lattice.Polyatomic.shape`.

        This method is internally used to expand the keys when getting or
        deleting items of a builder (i.e. ``sys[key] = value`` or ``del
