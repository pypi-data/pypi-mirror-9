Description: Kwant is a free (open source) Python package for numerical calculations on
        tight-binding models with a strong focus on quantum transport. It is designed to
        be flexible and easy to use. Thanks to the use of innovative algorithms, Kwant
        is often faster than other available codes, even those entirely written in the
        low level FORTRAN and C/C++ languages.
        
        Tight-binding models can describe a vast variety of systems and phenomena in
        quantum physics. Therefore, Kwant can be used to simulate
        
        * metals,
        * graphene,
        * topological insulators,
        * quantum Hall effect,
        * superconductivity,
        * spintronics,
        * molecular electronics,
        * any combination of the above, and many other things.
        
        Kwant can calculate
        
        * transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix),
        * dispersion relations,
        * modes,
        * wave functions,
        * various Greenâ€™s functions,
        * out-of-equilibrium local quantities.
        
        Other computations involving tight-binding Hamiltonians can be implemented
        easily.

        `mailing list <http://kwant-project.org/community>`_ is available for
        discussions, questions, and reporting bugs. The development of Kwant can be
        followed via the `public git repository <http://git.kwant-project.org/kwant>`_.
