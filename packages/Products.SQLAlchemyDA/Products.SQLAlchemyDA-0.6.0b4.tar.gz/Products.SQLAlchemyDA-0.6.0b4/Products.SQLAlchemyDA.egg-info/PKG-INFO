        ========================================
        
        
        About SQLAlchemyDA
        ------------------
        
        SQLAlchemyDA is a generic database adapter for Zope ZSQL methods, which are
        an older/legacy SQL templating feature for executing relational database queries
        from with in a Zope to transaction context.
        
        SQLAlchemyDA provides an implementation in the form of a Zope2 "product" which
        wraps `z3c.sqlalchemy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.sqlalchemy>`_, so that
        database connections are installable as objects in the Zope2 ZMI. Such
        connection objects can be set up to connect to any kind of database backend
        supported by SQLAlchemy using a database URI, such as Postgres, MySQL, Oracle,
        SQLite, MS-SQL, Firebird, Informix. However, some of these database backends
        have not been tested with the SQLAlchemyDA, so your mileage may vary.
        
        In addition to ZSQL support, the SQLAlchemyDA makes it possible to use the
        standard SQLAlchemy API within a Zope2 context and participate in Zope
        transactions.
        
        However, if you do not require ZSQL support, and only wish to call 'normal'
        SQLAlchemy APIs within Zope transactions, this package adds no value. Instead,
        you would be better off trying out `zope.sqlalchemy`, as recommended in the
        `Zope2 book chapter on relational database
        connectivity <http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/RelationalDatabases.html>`_.
        
        
        Requirements:
        -------------
        
        - Zope 2.10+
        - SQLAlchemy >= 0.5.0 (+ database specific low-level Python drivers)
        - z3c.sqlalchemy >= 1.2.0
        
        
        Installation:
        -------------
        
        - download and install SQLAlchemy as egg or from the sources
          from Cheeseshop (easy_install sqlalchemy). See
            
            http://www.sqlalchemy.org
        
            for details
        
        - download and install z3c.sqlalchemy as egg or from the sources 
          from Cheeseshop (easy_install z3c.sqlalchemy). See
        
            http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/z3c.sqlalchemy/
        
          for details.
        
        - unpack the archive containing SQLAlchemyDA inside the "Products"
          directory of your Zope instance home.
        
        - after restarting Zope you go to the ZMI and create an instance of
          "SQLAlchemyDA" (as you would create some DA instance)
        
        - click on the new created SQLAlchemyDA instance within the ZMI
          and configure your database connection through the "Properties" tab.
          The connection parameter 'dsn' must be specified as a valid SQLAlchemy DSN 
          like
        
                 <dbschema>://<username>:<password>@<hostname>/<databasename>
        
            Example:
                
                postgres://admin:123@localhost:5432/TestDB
        
        - ZSQL methods should see the new DA through the selection widget of available
          database adapters
        
        - NOTE: you must have the low-level Python DB drivers installed in order to 
          access a particular database. See 
        
                http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/dbengine.html#dbengine_supported
        
          for details.
        
        
        Configuration of SQLAlchemyDA:
        ------------------------------
        
        - 'dsn' - SQLAlchemy compliant Database Set Name (see www.sqlalchemy.org/docs)
        
        - 'transactional' - uncheck this property if you are working with a non-transactional
           database like older versions of MySQL. Uncheck this property *only* if you see any
           commit() related error. Otherwise leave this property checked. Changing this
           property *requires* a Zope restart.
        
        - 'quoting_style' - affects how strings are quoted in SQL. By default 'standard' 
           quotes strings correctly. Setting the value to 'no-quote' might solve quoting issues
           with some databases.
        
        
        Using SQLAlchemyDA:
        -------------------
        
        SQLAlchemyDA works as a database adapter as documented within "The Zope Book"
        
        http://www.plope.com/Books/2_7Edition/RelationalDatabases.stx
        
        and can be used like any other DA together with ZSQL methods.
        
        
        Tested with databases:
        ----------------------
        
        - Postgres 7.4, 8.0-8.2
        - SQLite 3.3.X
        - Oracle 10g
        - MySQL is *only* supported for MySQL databases with transaction support.
          (see also z3c/sqlalchemy/README.txt)      
         
        
        Known issues:
        -------------
        
        """ Database connection could not be opened ((ProgrammingError) (1064, You
        have an error in your SQL syntax near 'COMMIT .
        """
        
        This bug might appear with older MySQL versions when opening/closing
        the connections manually through the ZMI. It should not affect the
        functionality of SQLAlchemyDA.

        =========
        
        0.6.0b (2015-03-23)
        -------------------
        
        Beta Release: If you try out this version, please provide feedback!
        
        - Added alternative lookup API to get a handle on SAWrapper instances.  To use
          the new lookup mechanism, see Products.SQLAlchemyDA.da.py and look for the
          function `lookup_da`. This was created to allow avoiding Zope Acquisition as
          a lookup mechanism, and to work around the issue that the underlying
          z3c.sqlalchemy `getSAWrapper` function is non-usable when created by the
          SAWrapper DA. This is because API consumers have no access to the random 
          internally generated name ('util_id' attribute) under which the utility
          is registered...at least not without resorting to Acquisition calls.
        - Tested with SQLAlchemy 0.7.6, Zope 2.13, and Python 2.7.9, and SQLite.
          Your mileage may vary with other databases and versions, but most likely
          it will run with older versions of Zope and Python as old as 2.5 (running
          tests requires at least Python 2.5). Newer versions of SQLAlchemy will be
          tested for the next release.
        
        0.5.2 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        - Fixed LP #639597
        
        0.5.1 (2010-08-05)
        ------------------
        - fixed typo in type mapping
        
        0.5.0 (2010-05-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed LP #570208
        - Added a method 'add_extra_engine_options' to set additional engine
          options for SQLAlchemy.create_engine.
        - Removed SOFTWARE_HOME dependency
        - Requires SQLAlchemy >= 0.5.0
        
        0.4.1 (2008-06-01)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed issue with version.txt file
        
        0.4.0 (2008-01-24)
        ------------------
        
        - requires z3c.sqlalchemy (2.0.0 or higher)
        - requires SQLAlchemy 0.4.4 or higer
        
        
        0.3.0 (2007-06-10)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed some security assertions
        - added "Test" tab for executing SQL queries directly
        - better error handling for ZMI screens
        - no longer depending on a pre-registered SQLAlchemy wrapper. SQLAlchemyDA
          now accepts (as any other DA) a DSN as property 'dsn'
        - DSN can be passed through the add form
        - redirect directly to "Info" tab after creating an instance through the ZMI
        - catching some low-level exceptions from the sqlite interface in order to
          make it work with SQLite
        - new properties 'transactional' and 'quoting_style'
        - improved support for Oracle and MySQL
        - SQLAlchemyDA no longer provides access to mapper related functionalities.
          It now acts as a DA for executing SQL statements *only*.
        - fixed unregistration code for a wrapper (hopefully works with Zope 2.8 or
          higher)
        
        - updated documentation
        
        0.2.1 (2007-05-06)
        ------------------
        
        - connections can be closed/opened through the ZMI
        - some code cleanup
        - fixed a *very* stupid typo causing ZODB conflict errors
        
        0.2.0 (2007-05-05)
        ------------------
        
        - first public release
        
        0.1.0 (2007-04-30)
        ------------------
        
        - initial coding
