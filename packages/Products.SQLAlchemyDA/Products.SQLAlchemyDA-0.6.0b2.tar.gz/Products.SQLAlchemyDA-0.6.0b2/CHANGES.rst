CHANGELOG
=========

0.6.0b (2015-03-23)
-------------------

Beta Release: If you try out this version, please provide feedback!

- Added alternative lookup API to get a handle on SAWrapper instances.  To use
  the new lookup mechanism, see Products.SQLAlchemyDA.da.py and look for the
  function `lookup_da`. This was created to allow avoiding Zope Acquisition as
  a lookup mechanism, and to work around the issue that the underlying
  z3c.sqlalchemy `getSAWrapper` function is non-usable when created by the
  SAWrapper DA. This is because API consumers have no access to the random 
  internally generated name ('util_id' attribute) under which the utility
  is registered...at least not without resorting to Acquisition calls.
- Tested with SQLAlchemy 0.7.6, Zope 2.13, and Python 2.7.9, and SQLite.
  Your mileage may vary with other databases and versions, but most likely
  it will run with older versions of Zope and Python as old as 2.5 (running
  tests requires at least Python 2.5). Newer versions of SQLAlchemy will be
  tested for the next release.

0.5.2 (unreleased)
------------------
- Fixed LP #639597

0.5.1 (2010-08-05)
------------------
- fixed typo in type mapping

0.5.0 (2010-05-07)
------------------

- Fixed LP #570208
- Added a method 'add_extra_engine_options' to set additional engine
  options for SQLAlchemy.create_engine.
- Removed SOFTWARE_HOME dependency
- Requires SQLAlchemy >= 0.5.0

0.4.1 (2008-06-01)
------------------

- fixed issue with version.txt file

0.4.0 (2008-01-24)
------------------

- requires z3c.sqlalchemy (2.0.0 or higher)
- requires SQLAlchemy 0.4.4 or higer


0.3.0 (2007-06-10)
------------------

- fixed some security assertions
- added "Test" tab for executing SQL queries directly
- better error handling for ZMI screens
- no longer depending on a pre-registered SQLAlchemy wrapper. SQLAlchemyDA
  now accepts (as any other DA) a DSN as property 'dsn'
- DSN can be passed through the add form
- redirect directly to "Info" tab after creating an instance through the ZMI
- catching some low-level exceptions from the sqlite interface in order to
  make it work with SQLite
- new properties 'transactional' and 'quoting_style'
- improved support for Oracle and MySQL
- SQLAlchemyDA no longer provides access to mapper related functionalities.
  It now acts as a DA for executing SQL statements *only*.
- fixed unregistration code for a wrapper (hopefully works with Zope 2.8 or
  higher)

- updated documentation

0.2.1 (2007-05-06)

0.1.0 (2007-04-30)
------------------

- initial coding
