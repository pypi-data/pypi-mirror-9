Installation & Usage
--------------------


Aldryn Platform Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Choose a site you want to install the add-on to from the dashboard.

Manual Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Run `pip install aldryn-people`.

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        …
        'parler',
        'sortedm2m',
        'aldryn_people',
        …
    ]

3) Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate aldryn_people`.

   NOTE: aldryn_people supports both South and Django 1.7 migrations. However,
   If your project uses a version of South older than 1.0.2, you may need to add
   the following to your settings: ::

       MIGRATION_MODULES = [
           …
           'aldryn_people': 'aldryn_people.south_migrations',
           …
       ]

4) (Re-)Start your application server.


Download vCard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a CMS page and install the ``People`` app there (choose ``People`` from
the ``Advanced Settings -> Application`` dropdown).

Now redeploy/restart the site again.

The above CMS site has become a vCard download view.


Available Plug-ins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``People`` plugin lets you display list of people on a CMS page.


NOTES
-----


HVAD > Parler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project was converted from using django-hvad to django-parler from version
0.4.0. If you require HVAD in your project, checkout git tag v0.3.5_.

.. _v0.3.5: https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-people/tree/0.3.5

Python 3 (in-)compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to a dependency on the OSS project vobject_, which was last updated in 2009
and seems to strive to maintain Py2.4 compatibility, this project is currently
*not* Python 3 compatible. Pull requests for a Py3-compatible version of vobject
would be graciously accepted.
