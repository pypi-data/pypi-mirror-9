'''
Type safety checker module for python. The type safety checker uses
a debugger to check each function call and return and check the
value types according to the annotations specified.

Accepted annotations for type checked functions are class objects,
callable objects or tuples containing class and callable objects. If
any of the annotations does not conform to this rule the annotation
will be ignored.
