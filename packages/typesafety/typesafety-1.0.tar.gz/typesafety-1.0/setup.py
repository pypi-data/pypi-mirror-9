    Typesafety is a tool for writing type-checked code in Python. In languages
    like C++, Java, etc., this is a language-level feature, but Python has no
    such feature. With the advent of annotations it is however possible to write
    code with type notations. Typesafety is a means to enforce that those notations
    are valid.
