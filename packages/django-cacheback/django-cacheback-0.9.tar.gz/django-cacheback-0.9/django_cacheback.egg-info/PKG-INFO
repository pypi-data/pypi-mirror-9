        ----------------------------------------
        Asynchronous cache refreshing for Django
        ----------------------------------------
        
        What does this library do?
        --------------------------
        It's an extensible caching library that refreshes stale cache items
        asynchronously using a Celery_ task.  The key idea being that it's
        better to serve a stale item (and populate the cache asynchronously) than block
        the response process in order to populate the cache synchronously.
        
        .. _Celery: http://celeryproject.org/
        
        Using this library, you can rework your views so that all reads are from
        cache - which can be a significant performance boost.  
        
        A corollary of this technique is that cache hammering can be handled simply and
        elegantly, avoiding sudden surges of expensive reads when a cached item becomes stale.
        
        Do you have good docs?
        ----------------------
        Yup - `over on readthedocs.org`_.
