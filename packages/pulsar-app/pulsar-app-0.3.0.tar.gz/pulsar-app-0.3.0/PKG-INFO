        This project is a Python server application that allows a `Galaxy
        <http://galaxyproject.org>`_ server to run jobs on remote systems (including
        Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional
        Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred
        to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transfered back
        to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.
        
        Full documentation for the project can be found on `Read The Docs
        <https://pulsar.readthedocs.org/>`_.
        
        ------------------
        Configuring Galaxy
        ------------------
        
        Galaxy job runners are configured in Galaxy's ``job_conf.xml`` file. Some small
        examples of how to configure this can be found `here
        <https://pulsar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/galaxy_conf.html>`__, but be sure
        to checkout ``job_conf.xml.sample_advanced`` in your Galaxy code base or on
        `Github
        <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/master/config/job_conf.xml.sample_advanced>`_
        for complete information.
        
        ------------------
        Quickstart
        ------------------
        
        Full details on different ways to install Pulsar can be found in the `install
        section <https://pulsar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__ of the
        documentaiton, but if your machine has the proper Python dependencies
        available it can be quickly download and a test job run with.
        
        ::
        
            mkdir pulsar
            cd pulsar
            virtualenv venv
            . venv/bin/activate # .venv\Scripts\activate if Windows
            pip install pulsar-app
            pulsar-config 
            pulsar --daemon # just pulsar if Windows
            pulsar-check # runs a test job
        
        The `configuration documentation
        <https://pulsar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configure.html>`__
        has many details on securing your Pulsar server and enabling advanced features
        such as cluster integration and message queue communication.
        
        -----------------------
        Development and Testing
        -----------------------
        
        The recommended approach to setting up a development environment for Pulsar on
        Linux or Mac OS X is rougly as follows::
        
            git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar
            cd pulsar
            virtualenv .venv
            . .venv/bin/activate # .venv\Scripts\activate if Windows
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
        
        This project is distributed with unit and integration tests (many of which
        will not run under Windows), the following command will install the needed
        python components to run these tests. The following command will then run
        these tests::
        
            make tests
        
        The following command will then produce a coverage report
        corresponding to this test and place it in the ``coverage_html_report``
        subdirectory of this project.::
        
            coverage html
