0.8.5
--------

update buildout to new bootstrap file
undo setuptools pin
update for app engine sdk 1.9.17


0.8.4
--------

update for app engine sdk 1.9.11

remove mako and chameleon dependencies since they are no longer required for pyramid as of version 1.5


0.8.3.1
---------

somehow 0.8.3 got zipped with a README.rst instead of a readme.rst


0.8.3
--------

upgrade sdk to 1.8.7

fix setuptools craziness with rod.recipe.appengine by pinning
setuptools in versions.cfg

add flag in supervisor config for devappserver to avoid checking for
sdk updates when it starts up so that the app either comes up or
errors out, not just hangs there waiting for user input that it will
never get.


Slight modification to docs to give an actual opinion on whether to
use virtualenv or not. As in yes, use a virtualenv for less python
packaging pain. 



0.8.2-a2
---------

rebuild with all the artifacts (reademe.rst, CHANGES.txt etc.....)

0.8.2-a1
---------

added supervisord scripts to run dev_appserver

App Engine SDK version bumped to 1.8.0


0.8.1
----------------

include versions.cfg template for scaffold



0.8
----------------

bump sdk to 1.7.5

bump pyramid version to 1.4

upgrade to buildout 2.0

added versions.cfg to make managing versions of dependencies easier.

0.7
----------------

bump sdk version to 1.7.2

adding "unzip=true" to the buildout.cfg template to help out with eggs
that are distributed that way

pinning to pyramid version 1.3


0.6.1
-----------------
bump SDK version to 1.6.6

0.6: 06-13-2012
------------------

changed buildout.cfg to ignore site-packages which should fix a lot of
issues with various namespaces packages that pyramid potentially
depends on.



0.5.4.1: 05-05-2012
-------------------

doc corrections



0.5.4
-----------------

upgrading buildout to appengine sdk 1.6.5 and pyramid 1.3

changed application template to not use an ini file because it doesn't
really add any value on appengine, but handling the paste*
dependencies is troublesome for the recipe rod.recipe.appengine under
some circumstances.

This is just the default behavior of course, there's nothing stopping
you from deploying with an ini file if you wish.


0.5.3: 03-27-2012
-----------------

upgrading buildout to appengine sdk 1.6.4, the first SDK which works
with python2.7.

-----------------

fixes to address github issue #6

usage of project vs package used incorrectly.
