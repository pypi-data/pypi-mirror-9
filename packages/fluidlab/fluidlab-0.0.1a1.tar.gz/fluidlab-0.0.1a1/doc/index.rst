Welcome to FluidLab's documentation!
====================================

FluidLab is a framework for studying fluid dynamics by experiments
using Python.  It is part of the wider project `FluidDyn
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluiddyn/>`_.

The project is still in a planning stage so it is still pretty
unstable and many of its planned features have not yet been
implemented.
