.. _exp:
.. currentmodule:: fluidlab.exp


Physically, an experiment consists in interacting objects.  The
experimentalist wants to control the actions of the objects with a
good control in space and time and in a reproducible way. The results
are then some measurements about the studied physical phenomenon
produced by the measuring objects.  Usually, after the experiment has
been set up, it is repeted a number of times in order to vary some
parameters.

A experimental set-up is represented in FluidDyn by a class derived
from the class :class:`fluidlab.exp.base.Experiment`.  The
experiment class has attributes that represent the physical objects
interacting in the experimental set-up (composition).

Each realisation of the experimental set-up (with a particular set of
parameters) is represented by an instance of the experiment
class. Each experiment (each realisation) is associated with a
directory.

This package provides:

- some modules defining classes to represent base experiments:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree:

   base
   withtank
   withconductivityprobe

- a package with classes representing Taylor-Couette experiments:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree:

   taylorcouette

- other very simple classes derived from
  :class:`fluidlab.exp.withtank.ExperimentWithTank` and
  :class:`fluidlab.exp.withconductivityprobe.ExpWithConductivityProbe`,
  respectively:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree:

   doublediffusion
   vertduct
