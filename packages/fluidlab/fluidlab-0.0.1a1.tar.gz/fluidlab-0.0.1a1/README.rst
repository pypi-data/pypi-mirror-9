FluidLab
========

*Framework for studying fluid dynamics by experiments.*

`Package Documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/fluidlab>`__

FluidLab is the experimentally oriented package of the `FluidDyn
project <http://pythonhosted.org/fluiddyn>`__.  The project is still
in a testing stage so it is still pretty unstable and many of its
planned features have not yet been implemented.

It has first been developed by `Pierre Augier
<http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/people/Pierre.Augier/>`_ (CNRS
researcher at `LEGI <http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr>`_, Grenoble) in
the G. K. Batchelor Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at DAMTP, University of
Cambridge.

*Key words and ambitions*: fluid dynamics research with Python (2.7 or
>= 3.3); modular, object-oriented, collaborative, tested and
documented, free and open-source software.
