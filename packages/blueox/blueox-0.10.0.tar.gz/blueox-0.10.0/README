BlueOx - A python application logging framework

BlueOx is a python based logging and data collection framework. The problem it
attempts to solve is one where you have multiple python processes across
multiple hosts processing some sort of requests. You generally want to collect:

  * Performance data (counters, timers, etc)
  * User activity
  * Errors (and debugging data)

Use BlueOx to record that data, aggregate it to a central logging server where
it can be written to disk.

In addition, it's often useful to be able to plug reporting scripts into the
logging server so as to generate live stats and reports or do ad hoc analysis.

BlueOx's collection functionality is fairly advanced allowing heirarchies of
collectors and queuing in the event of failure. For example, it's recommend to
run an instance of `oxd` on each host, and then configure each of those
collectors to forward log events to a central collector on a dedicated log
machine.
