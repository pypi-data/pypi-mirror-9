In case a todo has subitems, a question is asked whether the subitems should be
marked as completed as well. When --force is given, no interaction is required
and the subitems are not marked completed.

In case a completed todo is recurring, a new todo will be added to the list,
while the given todo item is marked as complete. The new date is calculated
based on the todo item's due date. If the due date is in the past, today's date
is used to calculate the new recurrence date. Using --strict prevents this,
then the actual due date of the todo item is used to calculate the new
recurrence date. Note that a future due date is always used as such to
calculate the new due date.

Use --date to set a custom completion date.
