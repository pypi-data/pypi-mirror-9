        Simple Flow is a Python library that provides abstractions to write programs in
        the `distributed dataflow paradigm
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_data_flow>`_. It relies on futures
        to describe the dependencies between tasks. It coordinates the execution of
        distributed tasks with Amazon `SWF <https://aws.amazon.com/swf/>`_.
        
        A ``Future`` object models the asynchronous execution of a computation that may
        end.
        
        It tries to mimics the interface of the Python `concurrent.futures
        <http://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures>`_ library.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Provides a ``Future`` abstraction to define dependencies between tasks.
        - Define asynchronous tasks from callables.
        - Handle workflows with Amazon SWF.
        - Implement replay behavior like the Amazon Flow framework.
        - Handle retry of tasks that failed.
        - Automatically register decorated tasks.
        - Handle the completion of a decision with more than 100 tasks.
        - Provides a local executor to check a workflow without Amazon SWF (see
          ``simpleflow --local`` command).
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Let's take a simple example that computes the result of ``(x + 1) * 2``.
        
        We need to declare the functions as activities to make them available:
        
        .. code::
        
            from simpleflow import activity
        
            @activity.with_attributes(task_list='quickstart')
            def increment(x):
                return x + 1
        
            @activity.with_attributes(task_list='quickstart')
            def double(x):
                return x * 2
        
        
        And then define the workflow itself in a ``example.py`` file:
        
        .. code::
        
            from simpleflow import Workflow
        
            class SimpleComputation(Workflow):
                def run(self, x):
                    y = self.submit(increment, x)
                    z = self.submit(double, y)
                    return z.result
        
        Now check that the workflow works locally: ::
        
            $ simpleflow --local -w example.SimpleComputation -i example/input.json
        
        The file ``example/input.json`` contains the input passed to the workflow. It
        should have the format:
        
        .. code::
        
            {"args": [1],
             "kwargs": {}
            }
        
        which is equivalent to:
        
        .. code::
        
            {"kwargs": {"x": 1}}
