Description: PyFAI is an azimuthal integration library that tries to be fast (as fast as C
            and even more using OpenCL and GPU).
            It is based on histogramming of the 2theta/Q positions of each (center of)
            pixel weighted by the intensity of each pixel, but parallel version use a
            SparseMatrix-DenseVector multiplication.
            Neighboring output bins get also a contribution of pixels next to the border
            thanks to pixel splitting.
            Finally pyFAI provides also tools to calibrate the experimental setup using Debye-Scherrer
            rings of a reference compound.
