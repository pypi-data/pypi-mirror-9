Description: # imgur-uploader
        
        A simple command line client for uploading files to Imgur.
        
        Created for my [PyCon US 2015 Docker tutorial](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/312/) so that students using my cloud servers can see the gifs they create at the end of exercise 1.

        ## Quickstart
        
        ### Getting Imgur API credentials
        
        Go to https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient and register a new Imgur API client. You will need an Imgur account to do this.
        
        You can put it any valid URL for the callback URL - we won't be using it.
