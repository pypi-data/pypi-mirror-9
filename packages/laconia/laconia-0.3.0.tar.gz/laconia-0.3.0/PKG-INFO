Description: Laconia is a Python API for RDF that is designed
        to help easily learn and navigate the Semantic Web programmatically. 
        Unlike other RDF interfaces, which are generally triple-based, Laconia
        binds RDF nodes to Python objects and RDF arcs to attributes of those 
        Python objects.
