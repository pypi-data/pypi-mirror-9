Description: feincms-pagepermissions
        =======================
        
        A simple `FeinCMS <https://github.com/feincms/feincms>`_ extension that adds 
        permission-checking to a model. The model is assumed to be a Page, but it could
        be any FeinCMS model.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install using `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/>`_:
        
        ::
        
            pip install feincms-pagepermissions
        
        Change your Django settings to include pagepermissions:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                'pagepermissions',
            )
        
        Then add the extension to your content type:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            Page.register_extensions(
                ...
                'pagepermissions.extension',
            )
        
        This will add a permissions field to your content type that you will have to add
        yourself through syncdb or South or otherwise.
        
        When you edit or add a page you will have the option of setting the
        permissions required for a user to view that page. You can select multiple
        permissions, and if the user has any of those they will be able to view the
        page. Otherwise they will receive a 403.
        
        Finally, you may also want to keep a page out of the navigation if the user has
        no permission to view it. For this, there is a template filter called 
        ``check_page_permission``. Use it as follows in your template:
        
        .. code:: django
        
           {% load feincms_page_tags feincms_pagepermissions_tags %}
           
           {% feincms_nav feincms_page level=1 depth=1 as level1 %}
           {% for page in level1 %}
               {% if page|check_page_permission:user %}
                  ...display page navigation...
               {% endif %}
           {% endfor %}
