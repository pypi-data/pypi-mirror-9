    """Filter for rapidly finding all blocks of a given type.

    Keys are Block objects or integers.  Values are sets of (x, y, z)
    3-tuples.  Filters maintain the following invariants::

        vb = VoxelBuffer(...)  # with arbitrary contents
        block = Block(number, data)
        filter = Filter(vb)
        ((x, y, z) in filter[block]) == (vb[x, y, z] == block)
        ((x, y, z) in filter[number]) == (vb[x, y, z].id == number)

    The filter updates automatically when the VoxelBuffer changes.

    Initially constructing a filter is expensive, but keeping it up-to-date is
    relatively cheap.  You may realize performance gains by constructing a
    single filter and reusing it many times.

    Integer keys will not appear in iteration, because the same information is
    already available via block keys.

        Filters slow down the VoxelBuffers they are attached to.  Closing them

        Closing a filter twice is legal and has no effect.  Doing anything
        else with a closed filter will raise a :exc:`RuntimeError`.

        Filters close themselves when they are garbage collected, but you
        should not rely on this behavior.  The filter and the buffer form a
        reference cycle, so the filter will not be collected immediately under
        CPython.  Because of this delay, the finalizer will issue a warning if
        the filter is not already closed.
