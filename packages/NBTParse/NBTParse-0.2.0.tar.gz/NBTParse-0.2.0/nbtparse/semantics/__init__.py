"""Modules relating to NBT semantics

The modules in this package provide intermediate constructs to simplify
working with NBT.  Their primary purpose is making
:mod:`nbtparse.minecraft` modules less repetitive and easier to understand.

Nothing in this package directly relates to Minecraft itself, however, so
you may find uses for it in other contexts.
