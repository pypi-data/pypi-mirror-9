        Caveats
        =======
        
        Please take note that some calendars are not 100% accurate. The most common
        example is the Islamic calendar, where some computed holidays are not exactly on
        the same official day decided by religious authorities, and this may vary
        country by country. Whenever it's possible, try to adjust your results with
        the official data provided by the adequate authorities.
