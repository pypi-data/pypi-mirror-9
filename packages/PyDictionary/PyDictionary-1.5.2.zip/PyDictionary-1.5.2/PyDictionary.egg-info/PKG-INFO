Description: PyDictionary: A "Real" Dictionary Module for Python
        
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        
        
        PyDictionary is a Dictionary Module for Python 2/3 to get meanings,
        
        translations, synonyms and Antonyms of words. It uses WordNet for
        
        getting meanings, Google for translations, and thesaurus.com for getting
        
        synonyms and antonyms.
        
        
        
        This module uses Python Requests, BeautifulSoup4 and goslate as
        
        dependencies
        
        
        
        Installation
        
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        
        
        Installation is very simple through pip (or easy\_install)
        
        
        
        For pip
        
        
        
        ::
        
        
        
            pip install PyDictionary
        
        
        
        For Easy\_Install
        
        
        
        ::
        
        
        
            easy_install -U PyDictionary
        
        
        
        Usage
        
        ~~~~~
        
        
        
        PyDictionary can be utilised in 2 ways, either by creating a dictionary
        
        instance which can take words as arguments or by creating a dictionary
        
        instance with a fixed amount of words.
        
        
        
        For example,
        
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
        
        
            from PyDictionary import PyDictionary
        
            dictionary=PyDictionary()
        
        
        
        This is will create a local instance of the PyDictionary class and now
        
        it can be used to get meanings, translations etc.
        
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
        
        
            print (dictionary.meaning("indentation"))
        
        
        
        This will return a dictionary containing the meanings of the word. For
        
        example the above code will return:
        
        
        
        ::
        
        
        
            {'Noun': ['a concave cut into a surface or edge (as in a coastline', 'the
        
             formation of small pits in a surface as a consequence of corrosion', 'th
        
            e space left between the margin and the start of an indented line', 'the 
        
            act of cutting into an edge with toothlike notches or angular incisions']
        
            }                                                                        
        
        
        
        The dictionary keys are the different types of the word. If a word is
        
        both a verb and a noun then there will be 2 keys:'Noun' and 'Verb'. Each
        
        key refers to a list containing the meanings
        
        
        
        For Synonyms,
        
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
        
        
            print (dictionary.synonym("Life"))
        
        
        
        This will return a list containing the Synonyms of the word.
        
        
        
        For Antonyms,
        
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
        
        
            print (dictionary.antonym("Life"))
        
        
        
        This will return a list containing the Antonyms of the word.
        
        
        
        For Translations,
        
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
        
        
            print (dictionary.translate("Range",'es'))
        
        
        
        This will return the Translation of the word "Range" in Spanish. For
        
        Language codes consult Google Translate. The return value is String in
        
        Python 3 and Unicode in Python 2
        
        
        
        Alternatively, you can set a fixed number of words to the PyDictionary
        
        Instance. This is useful if you just want to get the meanings of some
        
        words quickly without any development need.
        
        
        
        Example:
        
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
        
        
            from PyDictionary import PyDictionary
        
        
        
            dictionary=PyDictionary("hotel","ambush","nonchalant","perceptive")
        
            'There can be any number of words in the Instance'
        
        
        
            print(dictionary.printMeanings()) '''This print the meanings of all the words'''
        
            print(dictionary.getMeanings()) '''This will return meanings as dictionaries'''
        
            print (dictionary.getSynonyms())
        
        
        
            print (dictionary.translateTo("hi")) '''This will translate all words to Hindi'''
        
        
        
        Similarly Synonyms and Antonyms can also be printed onto the screen.
        
        
        
        Using the PyDictionary API
        
        --------------------------
        
        
        
        I'm very happy to say that the PyDictionary API has been launched.
        
        
        
        It's very easy to use and it returns Meanings, Antonyms, Synonyms and
        
        Translations in JSON. It runs on Red Hat Open Shift Servers and it uses
        
        Flask.
        
        
        
        Usage
        
        ^^^^^
        
        
        
        For meanings,
        
        
        
        ::
        
        
        
            http://pydictionary-geekpradd.rhcloud.com/api/meaning/[word]
        
        
        
        For Antonyms,
        
        
        
        ::
        
        
        
            http://pydictionary-geekpradd.rhcloud.com/api/antonym/[word]
        
        
        
        For Synonyms,
        
        
        
        ::
        
        
        
            http://pydictionary-geekpradd.rhcloud.com/api/synonym/[word]
        
        
        
        For Translations,
        
        
        
        ::
        
        
        
            http://pydictionary-geekpradd.rhcloud.com/api/translate/[code]/[word]
        
        
        
        Replace word with the word parameter and 'code' with the Google
