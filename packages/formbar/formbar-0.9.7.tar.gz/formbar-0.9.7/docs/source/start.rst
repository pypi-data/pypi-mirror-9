About
=====
Formbar is a python library to layout, render and validate HTML forms in web
applications. Formbar renders forms which are compatible with `Twitter
Bootstrap <twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_ styles.

In contrast to many other form libraries forms with formbar are configured in XML
files to separate the form definition form the implementation and handle it as
configuration.

Formbar is the German word for "shapeable" and should emphasise the
character of formbar which hopefully makes shaping your forms more easy.

Installation
============
Formbar is available as `Pypi package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/formbar>`_.
To install it use the following command::

        <venv> pip install formbar

The source is availble on `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/ti/formbar>`_.
You can check of the source and install the library with the following

.. tip::

   I recommend to install the library for testing issue in the virtual python
