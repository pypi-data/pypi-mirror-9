        djohno is a tiny app for checking over your error pages, and email
        integration - to stop me doing evil things post-production to ensure
        I've set up Sentry and my error pages by randomly breaking parts of my
        site by editing code live.
        
        Documentation is available at https://djohno.readthedocs.org.
        
        Tests are run on Travis with every push - see
        https://travis-ci.org/dominicrodger/djohno.
        
        Release notes are available at
