Congratulations!

If you're reading this, you've got email configured correctly. You
might want to check the "From" section of this email to make sure it
looks OK.
{% if not pretty_from %}
It's probably a good idea to set DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL to something like
"Company Name <info@example.com>", so most email clients will display
it as coming from "Company Name" rather than just "info@example.com".
