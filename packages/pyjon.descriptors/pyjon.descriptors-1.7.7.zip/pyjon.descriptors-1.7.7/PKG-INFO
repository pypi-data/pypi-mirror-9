Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        pyjon.descriptors is a standardized way of describing a file and
        to get a generator that yields python objects from that file to your program.
        
        The yielded python objects contain attributes that are defined in an
        XML schema and their types and content are garanteed by pyjon.descriptors.
        
        The provided readers are `csv`, `xml` (specific schema) and `fixedlen`
        readers but more can be written easily.
        
        Running the tests
        =================
        
        install the tests requirements::
        
          $ pip install --upgrade tox
        
        the run the test suite and generate the coverage report with
        the following command::
        
          $ tox
        
        you should now have a directory called `coverage_html_report` with a file
        named `index.html` inside
        
        
        Python 3 compatibility
        ======================
        
        pyjon.descriptors should work just fine on Python 3.
        
        Note about upgrading from previous versions: "dirty" XML files (with custom "rc" tags) are no
        longer supported.
