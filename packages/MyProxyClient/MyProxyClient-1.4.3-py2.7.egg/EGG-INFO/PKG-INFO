Description: MyProxy Client Package
        ======================
        This a pure* Python implementation of a client to the MyProxy Credential
        Management Server (http://grid.ncsa.uiuc.edu/myproxy/).  It provides both a 
        Python API and a command line interface.
        
        * i.e. MyProxy C client libraries are not required for this package. 
        
        It uses pyOpenSSL to make an SSL connection to the server following the
        messaging interface as outlined in: http://grid.ncsa.uiuc.edu/myproxy/protocol/
        
        The code is based on an original program myproxy_logon by Tom Uram of ANL.
        
        Examples
        ========
        These show how to retrieve a certificate bootstrapping trust in remote service:
        
        API
        ---
        
        ```
        >>> from myproxy.client import MyProxyClient
        >>> myproxy_clnt = MyProxyClient(hostname="myproxy.somewhere.ac.uk")
        >>> cert, private_key = myproxy_clnt.logon(username, password, bootstrap=True)
        ```
        
        Command line interface
        ----------------------
        ```
        $ myproxyclient logon -s myproxy.somewhere.ac.uk -l <username> -o creds.pem -b
        ```
        
        Releases
        ========
        1.4.3
        -----
         * Fix for SSL to use TLS instead of SSLv3 to address POODLE vulnerability
         * Fix for SSL verification for PyOpenSSL version 0.14 - v1.3.1 was broken
           because it passed the call back method to OpenSSL using verification classes'
           `__call__` method.
           
        Tested on CentOS 6.4.
           
        1.3.1
        -----
         * Fix to `MyProxyClient.writeProxyFile` and 
           `MyProxyClient.readProxyFile` to correctly pick-up overridden file 
           setting.  Thanks to Nicolas Carenton, IPSL.
        
        Tests
        =====
        Unit test module with test files is in test/.  See the README in that directory.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        Sphinx generated documentation is available in documentation/.  run the 
        Makefile to regenerate if required.
