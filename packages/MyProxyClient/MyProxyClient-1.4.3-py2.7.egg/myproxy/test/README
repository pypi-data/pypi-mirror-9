MyProxyClient Unit Tests
========================
The unit test module is divided into two unit test classes: 

MyProxyClientLiveTestCase
MyProxyClientInterfaceTestCase

The first, MyProxyClientLiveTestCase depends on connection to a myproxy-server.
The test certificates and files in this directory are for illustration only.
They must be replaced with certificates issued by a CA that the myproxy-server
is configured to trust. See http://grid.ncsa.uiuc.edu/myproxy/ for guidance on 
installing and configuring MyProxy.

The second test class MyProxyClientInterfaceTestCase, performs sanity checks on
the getting and setting of attributes.  These tests can be run without access
to a myproxy-server service.

1) To run MyProxyClientLiveTestCase:

1.1) Start myproxy-server on it's host machine e.g. as root run,

$ myproxy-server

1.2) Edit myProxyClient.cfg and set the hostname element to the fully
qualified domain name of the MyProxy host OR alternatively set the environment
variable MYPROXY_SERVER to the host name e.g.:

$ export MYPROXY_SERVER=mytest.myproxy-server.somewhere

The environment variable setting will override any setting in the config file.  
You may also need to set the MYPROXY_SERVER_DN environment variable and/or 
experiment with the serverDN and serverCNPrefix config file settings to allow 
for any mismatch between the MyProxy server certificate Distinguished Name and 
the hostname of the host server.

The tests involve uploading new credentials, changing password settings and
finally removing these credentials from the MyP.  Make sure the MyProxy server you are using
for tests is configured to allow you to carry out these operations and that
you have test certificates issued by a CA that the MyProxy server is 
configured to trust.  If necessary download and install a copy of MyProxy for 
test purposes.  Tests may be run individually e.g. to test myProxy logon only. 
See 1.4)

1.3) Run the tests with the command:

$ python ./test_myproxyclient.py MyProxyClientLiveTestCase

1.4) To run individual tests give the test method name:

$ python ./test_myproxyclient.py MyProxyClientLiveTestCase.test1Store

 * Note that some tests are dependent on the output of previous tests.  
 * test1Store adds a new credential to the repository.  Running all the tests
   together as in 3) will ensure the credential is removed afterwards.  To
   check the existence of the credential after the test run test3Info:
   
   $ python ./test_myproxyclient.py MyProxyClientTestCase.test3Info
   
   or use MyProxy client commands on the MyProxy host: myproxy-info,
   myproxy-destroy.  If these fail, the content of /var/myproxy on the 
   target host can be checked to see if testuser credentials still exist.
 * See myProxyClientTest.cfg configuration file to change test parameters.
 * See the installation guide for MyProxy trouble shooting information.

2) To run MyProxyClientInterfaceTestCase only:

You may wish to run these tests alone if you don't have a configuration set-up
to connect to a myproxy-server.

Nb. Example certificates and private keys provided are from a test CA and are 
not for production use.

$ python ./test_myproxyclient.py MyProxyClientInterfaceTestCase

3) To run MyProxyClientLiveTestCase and MyProxyClientInterfaceTestCase:

$ python ./test_myproxyclient.py MyProxyClientLiveTestCase
