Description: OpenStack Python SDK
        ====================
        
        ``python-openstacksdk`` is a new Python library and SDK for OpenStack
        clouds. It is very young, and not yet usable, but it's under active
        development.
        
        Our goal is to provide a Python library which is:
        
        * Pleasant to use
        * Well documented
        * Complete (works with any OpenStack project)
        
        Building Documentation
        ----------------------
        
        This documentation is written by contributors, for contributors.
        
        The source is maintained in the ``doc/source/`` folder using
        `reStructuredText`_ and built by `Sphinx`_
        
        .. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
        .. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
        
        To build the docs locally::
        
            $ python setup.py build_sphinx
        
        Results are in the ``doc/build/html/`` directory.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Python 2.6+, Python 3.3+
        * pbr
        * requests
        * iso8601
        * stevedore
