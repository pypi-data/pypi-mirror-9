Description: rwslib
        ======
        
        The Goal of this library is to provide a (programmer) friendly client library to Rave Web Services (RWS).
        
        Philosophy
        ----------
        
        rwslib provides a convenient interface to RWS without hiding the implementation details. For instance,
        using rwslib you should have a simple way to request a list of studies from RWS but still be able to
        get to the HTTP headers, content body etc returned by RWS.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Documented with Sphinx. See http://rwslib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
