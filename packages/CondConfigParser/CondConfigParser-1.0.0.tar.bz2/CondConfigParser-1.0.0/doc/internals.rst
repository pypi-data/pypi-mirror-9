Internals
=========

This section contains automatically generated documentation from internal
modules of CondConfigParser. As such, it is only concerned about
implementation details that "normal" users should not need to know in order to
use CondConfigParser.

.. note::

   This chapter allows a quick glance at how CondConfigParser works
   internally. However, due to the completely automatic and largely incomplete
   state of this part of the documentation, directly reading the Python code
   in a decent text editor is likely to be more informative.
