basic-pkg-info.rst is automatically generated from the top-level
README.rst file by the prepare-basic-pkg-info.py script. This script is
in turn automatically called whenever needed by the Makefile rules that
build the documentation.

You may use the PYTHON Makefile variable to choose the Python
interpreter used to run prepare-basic-pkg-info.py. The default value of
this variable is 'python3'; if you want to use a different interpreter,
you can run for instance:

  make PYTHON=python3.4 html
