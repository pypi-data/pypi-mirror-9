        ``kids.cfg`` is a Python library providing helpers for loading your cfg file.
        
        It's part of 'Kids' (for Keep It Dead Simple) library.
        
        
        Maturity
        ========
        
        This code is in alpha stage. It wasn't tested on Windows. API may change.
        This is more a draft for an ongoing reflection.
        
        And I should add this is probably not ready to show. Although, a lot of these
        function are used everyday in my projects and I got sick rewritting them for
        every project.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        using ``kids.cfg``:

        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Tis code is python2 and python3 ready. It wasn't tested on windows.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You don't need to download the GIT version of the code as ``kids.cfg`` is
        available on the PyPI. So you should be able to run::
        
            pip install kids.cfg
        
        If you have downloaded the GIT sources, then you could add install
        the current version via traditional::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        And if you don't have the GIT sources but would like to get the latest
        master or branch from github, you could also::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/0k/kids.cfg
        
        Or even select a specific revision (branch/tag/commit)::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/0k/kids.cfg@master

        Push Request Guidelines
        -----------------------
        
        You can send any code. I'll look at it and will integrate it myself in
        the code base and leave you as the author. This process can take time and
        it'll take less time if you follow the following guidelines:
        
        - check your code with PEP8 or pylint. Try to stick to 80 columns wide.
        - separate your commits per smallest concern.
        - each commit should pass the tests (to allow easy bisect)
        - each functionality/bugfix commit should contain the code, tests,
          and doc.
        - prior minor commit with typographic or code cosmetic changes are
          very welcome. These should be tagged in their commit summary with
          ``!minor``.
        - the commit message should follow gitchangelog rules (check the git
          log to get examples)
        - if the commit fixes an issue or finished the implementation of a
          feature, please mention it in the summary.
        
        If you have some questions about guidelines which is not answered here,
        please check the current ``git log``, you might find previous commit that
        would show you how to deal with your issue.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.0.3 (2015-03-04)

        - Can access conf files not yet created but listed. [Valentin Lab]
        
          If you had listed a local file in ``REPOS/.foo.rc`` and a global config
          file in ``~/.foo.rc`` then you can store values and access them now via
          ``MConfig`` and the file will then get created.
        
        - Full support YAML, configobj, python config file, and multilayers
          config files. [Valentin Lab]
        
          - autodetection of syntax
          - 3 syntax provided: YAML, configobj, python config
          - write support provided for: YAML, configobj
        
        Changes
        ~~~~~~~
        
        - Use ``safe_load`` when parsing Yaml instead of ``load``. [Valentin
          Lab]
        
          If we have a valid reason to use ``load`` we'll consider putting it
          back.
        
        0.0.2 (2015-03-04)
        ------------------
        
        New
        ~~~
        
        - ``MConfig`` object allow read-write access to all config files at
          once. [Valentin Lab]
        
        - Full support YAML, configobj, python config file, and multilayers
          config files. [Valentin Lab]
        
          - autodetection of syntax
          - 3 syntax provided: YAML, configobj, python config
          - write support provided for: YAML, configobj
        
        Changes
        ~~~~~~~
        
        - ``find_files`` return now a label for each file coming from the find
          structure. [Valentin Lab]
        
          This is important to identify the matching pattern and give
          it an identifier.
        
        - Removed the defaut included ``mdict`` interface. [Valentin Lab]
        
          This interface was conflicting with normal dict interface. Decision
          was taken than ``mdict`` should only be used explicitely and only
          when needed.
        
        Fix
        ~~~
        
        - Code executed coming from config would loose references. [Valentin
          Lab]
        
          This is due to ``__builtins__`` being deleted in config. The only
          thing we wanted was actually to output a dict, so the workaround
          is to copy the key, value pairs excepts ``__builtins__``.
