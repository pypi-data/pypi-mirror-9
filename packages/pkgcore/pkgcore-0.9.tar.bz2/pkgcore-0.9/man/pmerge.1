.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
pmerge is the main command\-line utility for merging and unmerging packages on a
system. It provides an interface to install, update, and uninstall ebuilds from
source or binary packages.
.SH PORTAGE COMPATIBILITY
.sp
With regards to portage compatibility, pmerge provides much of the same
functionality that \fIemerge\fP does. In general, it should be possible to use
both pmerge and emerge on the same system in a sane fashion. For example,
pmerge can be used to install packages and then emerge should be able to
upgrade or uninstall them, or vice versa. Also, binary packages created using
pmerge should be able to be installed properly using emerge. Any major
compatibility issue that arises when trying to use both package managers is
probably a bug and should be reported.
.sp
In terms of option naming, pmerge tries to remain somewhat compatible to
portage so running "pmerge \-1av" should work the same as "emerge \-1av" when
using portage. However, pmerge doesn\(aqt implement nearly the same amount of
main_options that portage provides so many of the more obscure ones are missing. In
addition, pmerge defaults to a portage compatible output format that closely
matches the default colors and output structure that portage uses.
.SH POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B targets
extended atom matching of packages
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h\fP,\fB  \-\-help
show this help message and exit
.TP
.B \-\-version
show program\(aqs version number and exit
.TP
.B \-\-debug
Enable debugging checks
.TP
.BI \-\-color \ BOOLEAN
Enable or disable color support.
.TP
.BI \-\-add\-config \ <SECTION KEY VALUE>
modify an existing configuration section.
.TP
.BI \-\-new\-config \ <SECTION KEY VALUE>
add a new configuration section.
.TP
.B \-\-empty\-config\fP,\fB  \-\-config\-empty
Do not load user/system configuration.
.TP
.BI \-\-domain \ DOMAIN
domain to use for this operation
.UNINDENT
.SH PACKAGE QUERYING OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-N\fP,\fB  \-\-newuse
check for changed useflags in installed packages (implies \-1)
.UNINDENT
.SH AVAILABLE OPERATIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C\fP,\fB  \-\-unmerge
unmerge a package
.TP
.B \-\-clean
Remove installed packages that are not referenced by any target packages/sets; defaults to using the world and system sets if no targets are specified. Use with \fIcaution\fP, this option used incorrectly can render your system unusable. Note that this implies \-\-deep.
.TP
.B \-p\fP,\fB  \-\-pretend
do the resolution, but don\(aqt merge/fetch anything
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-failures
ignore resolution failures
.TP
.B \-a\fP,\fB  \-\-ask
do the resolution, but ask to merge/fetch anything
.TP
.B \-\-force
force merging to a repo, regardless of if it\(aqs frozen
.TP
.B \-f\fP,\fB  \-\-fetchonly
do only the fetch steps of the resolved plan
.TP
.B \-1\fP,\fB  \-\-oneshot
do not record changes in the world file; if a set is involved, defaults to forcing oneshot
.UNINDENT
.SH RESOLVER OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-u\fP,\fB  \-\-upgrade
try to upgrade already installed packages/dependencies
.TP
.B \-D\fP,\fB  \-\-deep
force the resolver to verify already installed dependencies
.TP
.B \-\-preload\-vdb\-state
Enable preloading of the installed packages database. This causes the resolver to work with a complete graph, thus disallowing actions that conflict with installed packages. If disabled, it\(aqs possible for the requested action to conflict with already installed dependencies that aren\(aqt involved in the graph of the requested operation.
.TP
.B \-i\fP,\fB  \-\-ignore\-cycles
Ignore cycles if they\(aqre found to be unbreakable; a depends on b, and b depends on a, with neither built is an example.
.TP
.B \-\-with\-bdeps
process build dependencies for built packages; by default they\(aqre ignored
.TP
.B \-O\fP,\fB  \-\-nodeps
disable dependency resolution
.TP
.B \-n\fP,\fB  \-\-noreplace
don\(aqt reinstall target atoms if they\(aqre already installed
.TP
.B \-b\fP,\fB  \-\-buildpkg
build binpkgs
.TP
.B \-k\fP,\fB  \-\-usepkg
prefer to use binpkgs
.TP
.B \-K\fP,\fB  \-\-usepkgonly
use only binpkgs
.TP
.B \-S\fP,\fB  \-\-source\-only
use only source packages, no binpkgs
.TP
.B \-e\fP,\fB  \-\-empty
force rebuilding of all involved packages, using installed packages only to satisfy building the replacements
.UNINDENT
.SH OUTPUT RELATED OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q\fP,\fB  \-\-quiet
suppress most output
.TP
.B \-v\fP,\fB  \-\-verbose
be verbose in output
.TP
.B \-\-quiet\-repo\-display
In the package merge list display, suppress ::repository output, and instead use numbers to indicate which repositories packages come from.
.TP
.BI \-F \ FORMATTER\fP,\fB \ \-\-formatter \ FORMATTER
which formatter to output \-\-pretend or \-\-ask output through.
