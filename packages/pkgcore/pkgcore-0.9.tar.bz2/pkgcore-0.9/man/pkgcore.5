.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
pkgcore is a framework for package management; via the appropriate class
plugins, the design should allow for almost any underlying repository, config,
or format to be used. However, it\(aqs currently focused on providing support for
ebuilds and the Gentoo ecosystem in general.
.SH PORTAGE COMPATIBILITY
.sp
In general, pkgcore tries to remain somewhat compatible with much of the
current portage configuration.
.SS Missing Functionality
.sp
The following is a list of semi\-major portage features that currently do not
have a pkgcore equivalent. Some of them are planned to be added in the future
while others are not (and are noted as such).
.sp
This section mostly serves as a warning for the unwary that might expect
everything to operate in the same fashion when switching between package
managers.

.IP \(bu 2
/etc/portage/repos.conf
.sp
Minimal support is provided for /etc/portage/repos.conf so most of the
attributes supported by portage aren\(aqt available. Support for more attributes
will be added in the future, but pkgcore is unlikely to ever support the full
set used by portage.
.IP \(bu 2
FEATURES="preserve\-libs"
.sp
Libraries \fIare not\fP preserved when sonames change during upgrades or
downgrades. This can easily render systems unworkable if major core system
library changes occur. Users will have to make use of revdep\-rebuild(1) from
portage until an equivalent is added to pkgcore and/or support for preserved
libs is added.
.sp
Note that this also means there is no preserved\-rebuild package set support
either.
.IP \(bu 2
dynamic deps
.sp
Dependency data for installed packages is always pulled from the vdb which is
only allowed to be altered on install and removed at uninstall. There is no
plan to support retrieving updated dependency data from unbuilt ebuilds in
source repositories and updating the vdb.
