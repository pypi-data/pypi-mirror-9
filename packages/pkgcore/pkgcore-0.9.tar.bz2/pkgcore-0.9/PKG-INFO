        What is pkgcore?
        ================
        
        pkgcore is a framework for package management; via the appropriate class
        plugins, the design should allow for any underlying repository/config/format to
        be used; slackware's tgzs being exempted due to lack of any real metadata, and
        autopackage format being exempted due to the fact they effectively embed the
        manager in each package (pkgcore *does* require being able to treat the pkg as
        data, instead of autopackage's method of handing resolution/all manager ops off
        to the package script).
        
        
        What does pkgcore require?
        ==========================
        
        At least python version 2.7, and snakeoil_ â€” a utility library with misc
        optimizations split out of pkgcore for others to use.  For unittests, mock_ is
        required if you're using anything less than python 3.3.
        
        
        Who to contact if I find a bug?

        =====
        
        **pclonecache**: clone a repository cache
        
        **pebuild**: low-level ebuild operations, go through phases manually
        
        **pinspect**: generic utility for inspecting repository related info
        
        **pmaint**: generic utility for repository maintenance (syncing, copying...)
        
        **pmerge**: generic utility for doing dependency resolution, fetching,
        (un)merging, etc.

        search, vdb search, etc.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Please take a look at either doc/ and dev-notes/ ; additionally, the code for
        the most part has docstrings, thus pydoc is a good reference.
        
        The `introduction docs`_ are good if you're just getting started. If you want
        to start hacking, take a look at the `development docs`_.
        
        In addition, html documentation is available at readthedocs_, alternative
        formats are also available for download_.
        
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        A standalone test runner is integrated in setup.py; to run, just execute::
        
            python setup.py test
        
        In addition, a tox config is provided so the testsuite can be run in a
        virtualenv setup against all supported python versions. To run tests for all
        environments just execute **tox** in the root directory of a repo or unpacked
        tarball. Otherwise, for a specific python version execute something similar to
        the following::
        
            tox -e py27
        
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        To build::
        
            tar jxf pkgcore-0.XX.tar.bz2
            cd pkgcore-0.XX
