        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This program, "churchdir", creates an address book from a spreadsheet file.  The 
        address book that is created is an html file which can be put on the Internet 
        (a password protected location [1]_ is strongly recommended), or on a local, 
        in-house server.  The spreadsheet file contains your lists of addresses.  This 
        file is saved in csv format.
        
        The churchdir program was created using the Python programing language and it 
        can be run on any computer (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) on which Python is 
        installed.  Python [2]_ is free to download [3]_ and use.
        
        Python 2.7 or 3.x will work.  3.x is recommended.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Once Python is installed on your computer (see above) install the Church 
        Directory software by executing this command from the command line:
        ::
        
          easy_install churchdir
        
        This will download the program from a repository of Python programs from 
        pypi.python.org and install it on your computer.
        
        Running the program
        -------------------
        
        This program works via the command line.  Create a directory in which to work
        and then make it your working directory:
        ::
        
          C:\> mkdir mydirectory
          C:\> cd mydirectory
        
        Then execute the program like this:
        ::
        
          C:\mydirectory> churchdir-quickstart
        
        You will then be asked a series of questions; most specifically, the name of
        the input file.  If the input file doesn't exist, a sample one will be created 
        for you. *(You should use this csv file to begin your address list since it 
        contains the correct headers.  Use a spreadsheet program to edit.)*
        
        After all the questions are answered, the output file (the address book) is 
        created in the current working directory.
        
        Photos
        ------
        
        Photos, specified in the "Photo URL" column of the input file, should be a head
        shot of one person, preferably 96x96 pixels.  A secondary, larger photo may be
        specified in the "Photo Secondary" column.  When a user visits the html page 
        and if he clicks on the head shot photo, the secondary photo appears.
        
        Changelog
        ---------
        
        * version 0.1: intial release
        
        * version 0.2: program now better handles bad csv input files
