        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Converts CGITest Eclipse camera tracking files to Nuke .chan camera files.
        
        The `Eclipse`_ camera system is a vehicle (usually helicopter) mounted
        camera system that offers stability and camera tracking to film & tv
        photography.
        
        CGITest is the provided application to write out the tracking data when the
        Eclipse system is running.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To convert a CGITest generated Eclipse camera tracking file in ASCII `.txt`
        format to a Nuke `.chan` file, all you need to do is supply a file to convert,
        and optionally the destination directory to place the converted file.::
        
            $ cgitest_convert CameraOn-1-cgiLog-141105-121524.txt -d ./chan_files/
        
        If you wish to offset the frame of the resulting frame range, you can
        provide a `-f` argument:::
        
            $ cgitest_convert CameraOn-1-cgiLog-141105-121524.txt -f 1001
        
        The default is 1
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Installing is as simple as using pip:::
        
            $ pip install CGITestConvert
