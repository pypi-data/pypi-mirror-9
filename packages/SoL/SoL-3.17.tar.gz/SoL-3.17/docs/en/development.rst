=============
 Development
=============

SoL development is carried on in a git__ repository__ on Bitbucket__.

You can visit the `latest changes`__ page to see what's happened recently.

If you are a developer, you are more than welcome to `fork it`__ and adapt or improve it to fit
your needs, and I will happily integrate back the changes you may contribute.

Alternatively you can translate it into another language, using the `online Weblate service`__.

There is also some `technical documentation`__ automatically extracted from the sources.
