 Dedication
============

For the second time in my life I'm *using* Carrom as a therapy, to
fight against blue times. It works great!

SoL is partially due to Joseph Leaded, an illiterate owner of a local
software house, who fired me after more than ten years of
collaboration and commitment on my part, stealing my work without
paying a dime for the last seven months. Without his rudeness I'd be
still injuring my brain writing silly Delphi apps on Window$. I *had*
to take a vacancy, to enjoy again the art of programming.

Seriously, I dedicate this work to my brother Fausto, who is surely
building perfect Carrom boards and teaching good shots in his
`निर्वाण`_: without him, neither Scarry nor SoL would have been
written.

Acknowledgements
================

I wanna say "Thank you!" to the various communities that made this
project easier and delightful:

Python_
  Simple things are simple, difficult ones are possible. With joy!

SQLAlchemy_
  Using relational databases at their full strength with a breeze of
  fresh air.

Pyramid_
  Programming for the web tends to tediousness… without a good
  and versatile framework.

ExtJS_
  I'm constantly surprised seeing how effective may be a fullfledged
  GUI inside a (good) web browser.

SCR_
  Good friends are a good thing!
