Tourney management
==================

.. figure:: tourney.png

   Tourney management

This is the core window of the application and is composed of four *panels*.

On the left there's the `competitors`_ one, where you can register new players, withdraw
existing ones or rearrange them in teams if season's :guilabel:`players per team` is bigger
than 1 (first round only).

On the right there's the `ranking`_ panel, where you can see the current ranking.
.. , possibly grouped by nationality.

At the bottom there's the `first round`_ view that let you alter the random combination
generated for the first round.

The remaining space in the middle is dedicated to the `matches`_.

The three panels on the borders can be minimized, thus maximizing the space for the
matches_. In particular, the one on the left and the one at the bottom are mainly used only
just before and just after the first round is created.

.. _competitors panel:

   Competitors panel

Competitors
-----------

This panel is used mainly at the start of a new tourney, to compose the group of participating
players. Using *drag&drop* you can either insert new players or rearrange them in teams, as
shown in the figure: you can drag single players from one team to another, or add new players
picking them from the :ref:`players <players management>` window. The :guilabel:`add…` button
brings up that window, showing only players **not yet** associated with the tourney.

.. note:: It is possible to add new players at any time, even when the tournament has already
          started and some matches has been played: even if this is not allowed in official
          tourneys, in amateur events it may happen that a player is late, or that one person
          of the public asks to enter the game. In such case, the new player gets zero points
          and is positioned at the end of the current ranking.

.. figure:: competitors_2.png
   :figclass: float-left

   Adjusted teams

You can see that there is a new completed team (with a green background); one team is not
complete because it has only one player: this has no effect on the succeding operations (it can
be played without problems) although it would be quite strange; another team will be deleted
(red background) because its only player has been removed.

.. hint:: Players may be removed from the panel by dragging them and dropping over any empty
          space (the scrollbar, when the panel is full): the icon associated to the drag
          operation will reflect the case.

.. important:: It's not possible to change the composition of a team once the first round has
               been played, for obvious reasons.

.. warning:: Although the interface allows to accumulate multiple changes to be committed in
             one single transaction, when you need to rearrange the composition of several
             teams, moving players around, it is recommended that you apply and confirm a
             single change at a time, to avoid incurring in possible integrity errors.

.. figure:: retire.png
   :figclass: float-right

   Withdraw confirmation

A competitor may be withdrew by double-clicking it and confirming the action: this means that
he won't participate to further games. He will show up in the ranking, though.

.. topic:: Teams

   From the application point of view, the number of players that compose a single competitor
   does **not** make any difference. Each game involves *two* distinct *competitors*, no matter
   how many players are grouped in each one, each group represent a *single* entity.

   When organizing a teamed championship, beware that any team is determined by the people
   assigned to it **and** by their ordering: the team `John and Paul` is **different** from the
   one composed of `Paul and John`, that is the same guys but in different order! This is where
   the `duplicate tourney` action is very useful.

   .. note:: The :guilabel:`nationality` of a team is determined by that of its first player,
             so order *matters*: be sure to drag in players in the right sequence.

First round
-----------

Once the registration has been completed, the next step is to generate the first round of the
tournament, that will be done taking into account the current rate of each player if the
tourney is linked to a particular :ref:`rating <glicko rating management>`, otherwise by
randomly pairing the competitors.

.. figure:: firstround.png
   :figclass: float-left

   First round recombination

The `tournament secretary` may decide that the random combination generated by the application
for the first round is not adeguate and some manual intervention is required. In this window,
enabled **only** before the first round is actually played, you can drag&drop competitors
around, swapping them as desired.

Even the association of matches with the carrom boards is random, for the first round. From the
second on ``SoL`` tries to give a different board for each round to a given player, following
ranking order. This guarantees that top players will preferably play on different low-numbered
boards, while weaker ones will use high-numbered boards, possibly repeatedly, in particular
when the number of players (and thus the number of tables) is very low.

   Deletion of rounds

Matches
-------

The middle panel is where most of the activity happens: here you iteratively create next round,
insert its results and compute the new ranking. The buttons on the left side of the grid let
you review the results of any played round: also the ranking panel gets reloaded to show the
corresponding state.

.. attention::

   Normally only the **last** round is editable, since the pairings of each turn depend on the
   results of previous rounds. It is therefore important to pay particular attention in the
   insertion of the *scores*.

     .. note:: In major tournaments it should be obligatory to print the results and let them
               show off for a few minutes (or display them on the monitor).

               The winners **must** check the correctness, **before** generating the next
               round.

   However it may happen that due to an error of any kind the wrong results have been inserted
   and thus a correction is necessary.

   If the errors appear in the last played round and no other round has been played yet, it's
   enough to *delete* the last round (if already generated), rectify the scores and the proceed
   as usual.

   If instead the errors are noticed in previous rounds and further rounds were played already,
   you can still change them (SoL asks explicit confirmation when you attempt to do so): the
   ranking will be recomputed, but obviously the pairing of the later rounds are **kept
   unchanged**.

   Last, if the errors are noticed only when the tournaments is terminated, the only possible
   solution is to manually tweak the assigned final bounties, to get a correct order in the
   tourney's ranking as well as in the championship's one.

.. hint::

   To insert the results of each round you may follow two distinct strategies:

     a. order the scorecards by board number and then insert the scores of each one: in this
        case you can use the :kbd:`TAB` key that moves the *focus* to the next field;

     b. when you have many boards (and thus the manual sort would be very tedious), you can
        “jump” directly to the result of a particular board by simply entering the board
        number: the *focus* will be moved to the right row and the score of the first
        competitor will be activated for editing.

.. _final round:

Final round
~~~~~~~~~~~

In major events it is possible to play one additional round to determine the top two (or four)
positions of the ranking.

SoL historically did not allow to insert the results of these final matches and the only way to
track their outcome was by manually adjusting the final bounties of the tournament. Version
3.1 implemented a proper handling of them: the :ref:`finals field <finals field>` on the
tourney controls the new behaviour.

When it is set to either ``1`` or ``2``, an explicit :guilabel:`Final round` button appears in
the menu: it generates the final round with one match between the top two competitors in the
ranking and, if the field is set to ``2``, another one between the third and the fourth
competitors, where the final scores can be eventually entered. When the :guilabel:`Final kind`
of the tourney is set to ``Best of three matches``, up to three additional rounds may be
generated with the usual :guilabel:`Next turn` button in the menu.

As soon as the final rounds are completed, the *prize-giving* operation is automatically
performed and the tournament ends.

      Ranking grouped by nationality

Ranking
-------

Whenever you change and commit the results of the last round the ranking is automatically
recomputed and shown here. The :guilabel:`prize` column is usually hidden until *prize giving*.

.. You can see the *national ranking*, grouping the view by the nationality of the
   competitor. The :guilabel:`print` button takes the current view in account and thus it emits
   the normal or the grouped printout.

.. hint:: By double-clicking on a competitor the matches_ panel focuses on him showing only his
          matches. You can see any other player details by double-clicking on another name. The
          match panel returns to the usual view either by double-clicking the same player a
          second time, or when a new round is created.

Once the :guilabel:`Bounty-giving` is done, the :guilabel:`bounty` column becomes editable,
either to manually force the bounties, or to swap top players after the final.
