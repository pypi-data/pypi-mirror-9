   The search menu

On the top right of the grid there are two buttons that respectively activate and deactivate
record filtering. The one with the magnifying glass icon adds a row of editable fields just
below the column titles where you can insert values that will be used as a filter on the
particular column. The other clears all the current filters.

As shown in the figure, with the menu on the left you can select a different filtering
criteria, for example to select players born before a particular date. The default criteria is
*contains*, that is entering the string ``“mat”`` in :guilabel:`lastname` filter will match all
the players whose lastname contains that string, that is either ``“Matys”``, or ``“Dematté”``,
or ``“Zumat”``.

It is possible to search on one or more column at the same time, for example to show only
french players you can enable the field guilabel:`country` and type the text ``FRA`` in its
search field, then maybe typing players initials in the field :guilabel:`firstname`.
