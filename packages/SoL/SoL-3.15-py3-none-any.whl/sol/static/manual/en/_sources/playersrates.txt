   pair: Players; Rates

Each :ref:`rating <glicko rating management>` produces a series of rates for each player, one
for each tourney associated with that rating he partecipates to. The most recent rate of each
player compose a ranking that *weight* the mutual strength, even when the players did not meet
each other directly.

This ranking allows the generation of non-random pairing in the subsequent tourneys. As a
statistical byproduct it is possible to obtain the trend in time of the strength of the
players, as a graphical chart.
