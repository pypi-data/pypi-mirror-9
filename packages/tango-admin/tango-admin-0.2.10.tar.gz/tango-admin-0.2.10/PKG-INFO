Description: Tango Admin
        =====
        
        Tango Admin is a collection of simple admin helpers for Django apps.
        
        It includes:
        * A responsive admin theme (at least, a lazy first pass at one)
        * An admin menu column. Thanks to @kezabelle for the idea.
        * Inlines can support a link to the related object.
        * Drag and drop tabular inlines
        * A textarea length counter
        * A "nuke user" function
        
        And some other minor improvements. It can be used with or without other Tango apps.
