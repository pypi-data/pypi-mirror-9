About this library
-------------------

Go is a continuous delivery system - http://www.go.cd/

The goal of this python library is to be an easy interface for the Go server.

This project was inspirated in the jenkinsapi library - https://github.com/salimfadhley/jenkinsapi


This library can help you:

* to list Go Agents
* to enable/disable/delete a Go Agent
* to see a job run history of an Go Agent
* to list Go Pipelines Groups and their Pipelines
* to schedule/release lock/pause/unpause a Go Pipeline
* to create and delete Go Pipelines from a XML config or delete Go Pipelines
* to create and delete Go Pipelines Groups
* to cancel a Go Stage run or see it's history


Python versions
---------------

The project have been tested and working on 2.7


Known bugs
----------

Currently compatible with Go version 14.3.0-1186.
No know bugs at the moment.

Installation
-------------

Using Pip
^^^^^^^^^

Run the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install gocdapi


Instaling from the source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can clone the repository and install:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/joaogbcravo/gocdapi.git
    python setup.py install


Example
-------
gocdAPI is intended to map the objects in Go (e.g. Pipeline Groups, Pipelines, Agents) into easily managed Python
objects:

.. code-block:: python

        >>> from gocdapi.go import Go
        >>> go_server =  Go("http://localhost:8153/")
        >>>
        >>> for uuid, agent in go_server.agents:
        ...     print uuid, " - ", agent
        ...
        a8b7c2b4-3986-476a-a797-abb3a065587e  -  Agent @ http://localhost:8153/
        >>>
        >>> agent = go_server.agents["a8b7c2b4-3986-476a-a797-abb3a065587e"]
        >>> agent.enable()
        >>> print agent.status
        Idle
        >>>
        >>> agent.disable()
        >>> print agent.status
        Disabled
        >>>
        >>> for name, pipeline_group in go_server.pipeline_groups:
        ...     print name, " - ", pipeline_group
        ...
        Development  -  Pipeline @ http://localhost:8153/
        >>>
        >>> pipeline_group = go_server.pipeline_groups["Development"]
        >>> for name, pipeline in pipeline_group:
        ...     print name, " - ", pipeline
        ...
        Web_Services_QA  -  Pipeline @ http://localhost:8153/
        Deploy_Web_Services  -  Pipeline @ http://localhost:8153/
        >>>


Testing
-------

After the installation of the test dependencies on your system, run the command:

.. code-block:: bash

        python setup.py nosetests

Nose need a Go Server and Agent to run, so when you execute nosetests it will start a new Go Server and Agent, and it
will shutdown them after all the test run. If you haven't the executable in the gocdapi_tests/systests folder it will
download them. This process can be slow, so you can start by yourself a Go Server and Agent and run nosetests in the
following way:

.. code-block:: bash

        python nosetests -s --nologcapture --tc=static_instances:true

To make a source code analysis, you can run pep8 and pylint:

.. code-block:: bash

        pep8 --ignore=E501 gocdapi/*.py
        pylint --rcfile=pylintrc gocdapi/*.py
