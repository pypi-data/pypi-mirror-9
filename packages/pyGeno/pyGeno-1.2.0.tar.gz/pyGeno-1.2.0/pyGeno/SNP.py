----
-All classes must inherit from SNP_INDEL
-All classes name must end with SNP
-A SNP_INDELs must have at least chromosomeNumber, setName, species, start and ref filled in order to be inserted into sequences
-User can define an alias for the alt field (snp_indel alleles) to indicate the default field from wich to extract alleles
