Description: # yt.recipe.relativeworkaround
        
        This is a buildout recipe that will fix an annoying with buildout: when the
        relative-paths options is turned on, it will still use the absolute path when referencing
        the buildout root:
        
            # buildout.cfg
            [buildout]
            relative-paths = true
        
            [scripts]
            recipe = z3c.recipe.scripts:scripts
            eggs =
                fabric
            interpreter = python
        
        
        The result is absloute paths still added in various places:
        
            $ cat parts/scripts/site.py | grep `pwd`
                '/Users/yusuket/stash/TOOL/shipit'
        
        
        Run this recipe at the end of your build, and it will do it's best to
        correct them to the proper values.
