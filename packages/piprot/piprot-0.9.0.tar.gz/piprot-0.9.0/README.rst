piprot
======

How rotten are your requirements?

tl;dr: piprot allows you to check the requirements defined in your
requirements files for freshness.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest release of piprot can be installed via PyPI:

::

    pip install -U piprot

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

Run piprot and provide a requirements file (if it's not called
requirements.txt) and it will tell you the current status of your
packages.

::

    > piprot base_requirements.txt
    requests (2.3.0) is up to date
    six (1.6.1) is 107 days out of date. Latest is 1.7.3
    piprot (0.6.0) is up to date
    doge (3.4.0) is 129 days out of date. Latest is 3.5.0
    Your requirements are 236 days out of date

If your requirements file is named "requirements.txt", you don't need to
provide it. piprot will automatically traverse included requirements
files.

The ``--verbatim`` argument will output your complete requirements file,
with some comments about the out of date nature of your packages.

::

    > piprot --verbatim
    # Requirements for Piprot
    # This actually doubles as a test file

    requests==2.3.0
    six==1.6.1 # Latest 1.7.3

    piprot==0.6.0
    # notarequirement==0.1.1

    doge==3.4.0 # Latest 3.5.0
    # Generated with piprot 0.7.0
    # Your requirements are 236 days out of date

Using ``--outdated`` will show only the out of date requirements, pretty
much the same as running ``pip list -o``, except on a requirements file.

::

    > piprot --outdated
    six (1.6.1) is 107 days out of date. Latest is 1.7.3
    doge (3.4.0) is 129 days out of date. Latest is 3.5.0
    Your requirements are 236 days out of date

The ``--latest`` argument will output the requirements lines with the
current version replaced with the latest version.

::

    > piprot --latest
    ipython (1.1.0) is 331 days out of date. Latest is 2.2.0
    ipython==2.2.0 # Updated from 1.1.0
    Django (1.5.4) is 241 days out of date. Latest is 1.6.5
    Django==1.6.5 # Updated from 1.5.4
    requests (1.2.3) is 356 days out of date. Latest is 2.3.0
    requests==2.3.0 # Updated from 1.2.3
    Your requirements are 928 days out of date

Personally, I like to use ``--latest`` and ``--verbatim`` together,
creating a sort-of ''perfect'' requirements file for me,

::

    > piprot --latest --verbatim
    # Development Requirements
    ipython==2.2.0 # Updated from 1.1.0

    Django==1.6.5 # Updated from 1.5.4
    requests==2.3.0 # Updated from 1.2.3
    # Generated with piprot 0.8.0
    # Your requirements are 928 days out of date

Yep, you can use stdin as well if you really want to, but there are
better tools for working with packages installed in your environment.

::

    pip freeze | piprot


(New in 0.9) You can also lookup requirements from a Github repo with the ``--github``,
``--branch`` and ``--path`` options. Additionally you can use ``--token`` to
supply a `Personal Access Token` to remotely test private repositories.

::

    > piprot -g sesh/piprot
    requests (2.4.2) is out of date. Latest is 2.4.3
    requests-futures (0.9.5) is up to date
    six (1.8.0) is up to date
    piprot (0.8.2) is up to date
    Looks like you've been keeping up to date, time for a delicious beverage!


Working with your environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

piprot is designed around working with requirements defined in a
requirements file. Check out
`pip-tools <https://github.com/nvie/pip-tools>`__ if you're looking for
something similar that's designed for use against the packages that you
actually have installed.

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since version 0.7.0 piprot has had support for uploading your
requirements to `piprot.io <https://piprot.io>`__ to receive weekly
notifications about packages that have been updated. You can upload your
requirements using a command like this:

::

    piprot --notify=brenton@piprot.io requirements.txt

This service was created by @sesh (the creator of this tool, me!) and
may at some point in the future require a small fee for ongoing
notifications.

Installing post-commit hook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install a simple post-commit hook to automatically upload your
requirements every time you commit to your repository. Run the following
command and add the output to ``.git/hook/post-commit``:

::

    piprot --notify-post-commit

You will be asked a few questions to help set up the hook before the
output.

Tests
~~~~~

To run the test suite, execute ``python -m unittest discover``, within
the project directory.

Please ensure that the (limited) tests are all passing before making a
pull request. Feel free to add more.
