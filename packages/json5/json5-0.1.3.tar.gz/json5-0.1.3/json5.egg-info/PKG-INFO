        pyjson5
        =======
        
        A Python implementation of the
        `JSON5 data format <https://github.com/aseemk/json5>`.
        
        `JSON5 <https://github.com/aseemk/json5>` extends the 
        `JSON <http://www.json.org>` data interchange format to make it
        slightly more usable as a configuration language:
        
        * JavaScript-style comments (both single and multi-line) are legal.
        
        * Object keys may be unquoted if they are legal JavaScript field names.
        
        * Objects and arrays may end with trailing commas.
        
        * Strings can be single-quoted, and multi-line string literals are allowed.
        
        There are a few other more minor extensions to JSON; see the above page for
        the full details.
        
        This project implements a reader and writer implementation for Python;
        where possible, it mirrors the
        `standard Python JSON API <https://docs.python.org/library/json.html>`
        for ease of use.
        
        This is an early release. It is not well-tested, and has not been tuned
        for performance.
