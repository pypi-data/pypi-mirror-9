Description: 
        The Asynchronous Message Tool Kit. Utilities for the AMQP.
        Currently three tools are supported; record, play and merge.
        
        The record tool reads messages from the exchange and prints
        them to stdout. Messages are recorded in json format.
        
        The play tool reads messages from a file and sends them to the
        target exchange.
        
        The merge tool uses message_ids to merge recordings into a single
        file.
