Pyflect
=======

Have you ever needed to get the list of all fields of an object in Python? Of course you can easily use the power of
``dir``...and get lost in a bunch of magic attributes.

The ones coming from the Java world know the sweet taste of having e.g. ``getMethods`` and ``getFields`` methods. This module
introduces some flavours of Java-like reflection into the Python world.
