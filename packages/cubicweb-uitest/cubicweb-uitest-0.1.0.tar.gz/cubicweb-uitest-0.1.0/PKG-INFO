Description: Summary
        -------
        
        This cube is meant to serve both test and documentation purpose.
        To achive this, the cube must ideally provide the samples of all basic cubicweb
        views.
        
        Schema
        ------
        
        The main cube's entity is `EveryThing` with is supposed to contain all basic
        cubicweb fields (e.g `String`, `Int`, `DateTime`, `Passowrd`, etc) bind whith
        all basic cubicweb widgets and some widgets provided by cubes, if deemed useful.
        
        A bunch of `EveryThing` is automatically created during the initialization of a
        new instance.
        
        Views
        -----
        
        There is two types of views :
        
        * **static views** : a collection of typography samples such as headings,
          paragraphs, lists gathered together.
        
        * **dinamic views** : a collection of basic cubicweb views applied to EveryThing
          entities. Each view must provide it's pyhon code.
        
        
        Instance
        ---------
        
        Cube instances must allow anonymous acces.
