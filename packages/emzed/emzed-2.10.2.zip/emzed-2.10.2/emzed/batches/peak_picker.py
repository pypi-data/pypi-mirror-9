def runPeakPickerHiRes(pattern=None, destination=None, configid=None, **params):

    """ import runPeakPickerHiRes.
    runs peakPickerHiRes from openMs in batch mode.
    - input files are map files (mzXML, mxML, mzData),
    - ouput files are mzML files, with extended file name.
    - *pattern* is
    - *destination* is the path of the output file
    - *configid* is

    You can add modifications to the standard parameters, e. g.
    *signal_to_noise*, as named arguments.

    If you have multiple configs for the peakpicker, you can give an
    configid as defined in algorithm_configs.py, or you are asked to choose
    a config.

    If you have a single config this one is used automatically.

    Examples:
    
    - runPeakPickerHiRes()
       asks for source files and target directory
       asks for config if multiple algorithm_configs are defined

    - runPeakPickerHiRes(configid="std", signal_to_noise = 2.0)
       uses config with id "std", overwrites signal_to_noise
       parameter with signal_to_noise=2.0.

    - runPeakPickerHiRes(signal_to_noise = 2.0)
       asks for source files and target directory
       runs peak picking with modified parameter.

    - runPeakPickerHiRes(pattern)
       looks for map files matching pattern
       resulting mzML files are stored next to input map file

    - runPeakPickerHiRes(pattern, signal_to_noise = 2.0)
       looks for map files matching pattern
       resulting mzML files are stored next to input map file
       runs peak picking with modified parameter

    - runPeakPickerHiRes(pattern, destination)
       looks for map files matching pattern
       resulting mzML files are stored at destination directory

    - runPeakPickerHiRes(pattern, destination, signal_to_noise = 2.0)
       looks for map files matching pattern
       resulting csv files are stored at destination directory
       runs peak picking with modified parameter
