Installation
------------

``plone.app.event`` only provides Dexterity behaviors to build own types based
on them.  If you want to install a Dexterity based Event type, you can simply
use ``plone.app.contenttypes`` 1.2a3 or up.

Depend on one (or both) of these setuptools dependencies::

    'plone.app.event'


The zcml dependency is be loaded automatically by z3c.autoinclude.

Then install plone.app.event via the controlpanel or by depending on the
following GenericSetup profile in metadata.xml::

    plone.app.event:default


Upgrading from plone.app.event 1.x
----------------------------------

TODO: ...

There are upgrade steps in plone.app.contenttypes for 1.x to 2.0. That has to
be revisited and refactored.


Upgrading from plone.app.event 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO: ...

The "ploneintegration" setuptools extra, subpackage and GenericSetup profile
have been gone. You just need to remove these dependencies from your setup and
use the "plone.app.event.at:default" profile instead, if you plan to use the
Archetypes based ATEvent type.

Use the provided upgrade steps to upgrade Dexterity behaviors: Attribute
storage (Migrate fields from annotation storage to attribute storage) and New
IRichText behavior (Enable the new IRichText instead of the IEventSummary
behavior).


Upgrading from Products.ATContentType to plone.app.event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

  Please backup before upgrading and check the upgraded contents for validity!

If you want to upgrade Products.ATContentTypes based ATEvents to
plone.app.event ones, there is an upgrade step for that: "Upgrades old AT
events to plone.app.events" (Metadata version 1 to 2). In order to use it, go
to Plone Control Center -> ZMI -> portal_setup -> Upgrades. Select
"plone.app.event.at:default" profile and click "Show old upgrades". Select the
upgrade step and run it.

You might also need to "clear and rebuild" the catalog after upgrading. You can
do so at Plone Control Center -> ZMI -> portal_catalog -> Advanced (this
may take a while)


Upgrading to Dexterity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrade steps to migrate Products.ATContentTypes based ATEvents,
plone.app.event based ATEvents or plone.app.event Dexterity example types
(plone.app.event.dx.event) to plone.app.contenttypes Dexterity Events can be
found within plone.app.contenttypes. This package utilizes plone.app.event's
Dexterity behaviors for it's Event type.


Configuration
-------------

.. note::

  Don't forget to set the portal timezone!

After installation, please set your timezone in the @@event-settings
controlpanel. Otherwise time calculations are based on UTC and likely wrong for
your timezone. Also set the first weekday setting for correct display of the
first weekday in calendar views.
