txwinrm: Async Python WinRM Client
==================================

At Zenoss we are working on a project to improve the reliability, performance
and features of native Windows monitoring. The core of this project is this
Python library for asynchronously managing Windows using the WinRM and WinRS
services. This library will then be used by Zenoss to do automatic discovery
and monitoring the way Zenoss users are used to with some new possibilities.

Right now we're trying to get as much real world experience using the library
as possible to prove out the reliability and performance improvements we're
hoping to achieve. If you have access to Windows servers, you can help! It
doesn't even require a Zenoss Core installation as this tool stands alone right
now.

See the zenoss-windows forum for updates to the project, and leave your
feedback there.

Installation
------------

Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 LTS (Python 2.7.3)

::

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get -y install gcc python-dev libkrb5-dev krb5-user python-setuptools
    # if prompted for your kerberos realm, leave it blank and choose OK

    sudo easy_install txwinrm

    # if you want to use a Windows domain
    sudo genkrb5conf <windows domain> <domain controller IP address>

    # now you can run the txwinrm commands (winrm, winrs, typeperf, and wecutil)
 
 
Centos 6.3 x86_64 (Python 2.6.6)

::
 
    # as root
    yum -y install gcc python-devel krb5-devel krb5-workstation python-setuptools
    easy_install txwinrm
     
    # if you want to use a Windows domain
    genkrb5conf <windows domain> <domain controller IP address>
     
    # now you can run the txwinrm commands (winrm, winrs, typeperf, and wecutil) as a normal user


Zenoss Core or Resource Manager 4.2.x installed on CentOS 6 (Zenoss Python 2.7)

::

    # as root
    yum -y install gcc krb5-devel krb5-workstation

    # as the zenoss user
    easy_install txwinrm

    # as root (if you want to use a Windows domain)
    genkrb5conf <windows domain> <domain controller IP address>

    # now you can run the txwinrm commands (winrm, winrs, typeperf, and wecutil) as the zenoss user


Current Feature Support
-----------------------

-  HTTP
-  Basic authentication
-  WQL queries
-  WinRS
-  typeperf
-  Subscribe to the Windows Event Log
-  Kerberos authentication (domain accounts)


Future Feature Support
----------------------

-  HTTPS
-  NTLM authentication (local accounts)


Configuring the Target Windows Machines
---------------------------------------

You can enable the WinRM service on Windows Server 2003, 2008 and 2012. Run
Command Prompt as Administrator and execute the following commands

::

    winrm quickconfig
    winrm s winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true";MaxConcurrentOperationsPerUser="4294967295"}
    winrm s winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
    winrm s winrm/config/winrs @{MaxShellsPerUser="2147483647"}


WQL Queries
-----------

You can pass a single host a query via the command line...

::

    $ winrm -r host -u user -f "select * from Win32_NetworkAdapter"


Another option is to create an ini-style config file and hit multiple targets
with multiple queries. Example config is at `examples/config.ini <https://raw.github.com/zenoss/txwinrm/master/examples/config.ini>`_

::

    $ winrm -c path/to/config.ini


This will send WinRM enumerate requests to the hosts listed in config.ini. It
will send a request for each WQL query listed in that file. The output will
look like

::

    <hostname> ==> <WQL query>
        <property-name> = <value>
        ...
        ---- (indicates start of next item)
        <property-name> = <value>
        ...
    ...


Here is an example...

::

    cupertino ==> Select name,caption,pathName,serviceType,startMode,startName,state From Win32_Service
      Caption = Application Experience
      Name = AeLookupSvc
      PathName = C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs
      ServiceType = Share Process
      StartMode = Manual
      StartName = localSystem
      State = Stopped
      ----
      Caption = Application Layer Gateway Service
      Name = ALG
    ...


A summary of the number of failures if any and number of XML elements processed
appears at the end. The summary and any errors are written to stderr, so
redirect stdin to /dev/null if you want terse output.

::

    $ winrm -c path/to/config.ini >/dev/null

    Summary:
      Connected to 3 of 3 hosts
      Processed 13975 elements

          4.30% of CPU time used by WmiPrvSE#2 process with pid 1268


The '-a' option specifies the authentication method. Currently supported values
are 'basic' and 'kerberos'. 'basic' is the default.

The '-d' option increases logging, printing out the XML for all requests and
responses, along with the HTTP status code.


WinRS
-----

The winrs program has four modes of operation:

-  interactive (default): Execute many commands in an interactive command
   prompt on the remote host
-  single: Execute a single command and return its output
-  long: Execute a single long-running command like
   'typeperf -si 1' and check the output periodically
-  batch: Opens a command prompt on the remote system and
   executes a list of commands (actually right now it executes one
   command twice as a proof-of-concept)


An example of interactive mode

::

    $ winrs interactive -u Administrator -x 'typeperf "\Memory\Pages/sec" "\PhysicalDisk(_Total)\Avg. Disk Queue Length" "\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time" -si 1' -r oakland

Typeperf
--------

txwinrm's typeperf command allows you to run a remote typeperf command, check
the output periodically, parse it, and print it to stdout. It support the -si
option and multiple counters. Here is an example:

::

    $ typeperf -r gilroy -u Administrator '\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time' '\memory\Available Bytes' '\paging file(_Total)\% Usage'
    \memory\Available Bytes
      00:54:27: 193130496.0
    \paging file(_Total)\% Usage
      00:54:27: 0.012207
    \Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time
      00:54:27: 0.004487
    \memory\Available Bytes
      00:54:28: 193216512.0
      00:54:29: 193982464.0
    \paging file(_Total)\% Usage
      00:54:28: 0.012207
      00:54:29: 0.012207
    \Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time
      00:54:28: 1.542879
      00:54:29: 0.004487
    \memory\Available Bytes
      00:54:30: 193933312.0
      00:54:31: 193941504.0
    \paging file(_Total)\% Usage
      00:54:30: 0.012207


Subscribing to the Windows Event Log
------------------------------------

The following command shows an example of subscribing to the Windows event log:

::

    $ wecutil -r saratoga -u Administrator
    Pull #1
    Event(system=System(provider='Microsoft-Windows-EventForwarder', event_id=111, event_id_qualifiers=None, level=None, task=None, keywords=None, time_created=datetime.datetime(2013, 5, 8, 20, 29, 31, 132000), event_record_id=None, channel=None, computer='saratoga.solutions.loc', user_id=None), data=None, rendering_info=None)
    Pull #2


You can run wecutil against a matrix of hosts and event queries by using a config file.

::

    $ wecutil -c examples/config.ini
    milpitas System/'*' pull #1 of 2
    milpitas Application/'*' pull #1 of 2
    gilroy System/'*' pull #1 of 2
    ...
    milpitas System/'*' Event(system=System(provider='Microsoft-Windows-...
    ...
    milpitas Application/'*' pull #2 of 2
    ...
