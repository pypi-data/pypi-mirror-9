        Introduction
        ============
        
        `EEA Daviz`_ is a web tool developed by the European Environment Agency which
        helps creating interactive data visualizations easily through the web
        browser, no extra tools are necessary. It is free and open source.
        
        You can generate attractive and interactive charts and combine them in a
        dashboard with facets/filters which updates the charts simultaneously.
        Data can be uploaded as CSV/TSV or you can specify SPARQL to query
        online Linked open data servers (aka sparql endpoints).
        
          **Daviz is the first Semantic web data visualisation tool for Plone CMS,
          entirely web-based!**
        
        At the moment `Simile Exhibit`_ and `Google Charts`_ visualizations are
        supported. The architecture allows to extend Daviz with more
        visualisation libraries (visualisations plugins).

        =============
        
        |Daviz features diagram|
        
        1. No desktop tools needed to make visualizations. all web based.
        2. Data input: easy copy and paste of data table from any webpage or
           excel sheet
        3. Data input from URL (CSV/TSV/JSON)
        4. Data input: drag-and-drop your data from CSV/TSV files, and we do the rest
        5. Data input advanced: retrieve data from any SPARQL endpoint on the fly
        6. Intuitive visualization editor to create interactive charts.
        7. Large amount of visualizations available: Area, Bar,
           Bubble, Candlestick, Column, Combo Chart, Gauge, Geo Intensity Maps,
           Line, Pie, Radar, Scatter, Stepped Area, Table, Tree Map, Motion Charts,
           Faceted search table, Faceted tiles, Faceted timeline,
           Faceted map and more...
        8. Dashboard. Group charts into one or more dashboards.
        9. Share any chart. Embeddable visualization in any webpage.
        10. Customizable chart options and colors
        11. Data table manipulation via drag and drop, preparing table for chart
        12. Pivot table (Transpose), transform row values into columns
        13. Modular framework for extending it with more visualizations
        14. Branding: add your own logo to each chart + QR code
        15. And much more...
        
        
        It is simple to use, needs no desktop application, everything is done
        through the web by uploading an "excel file", CSV, TSV. You can also query
        the "web of data" via public available sparql endpoints.
        
        You can easily make visualizations like:
        
        1. `Simile Exhibit <http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit3>`_
        2. `Google Charts <http://code.google.com/apis/chart>`_
        
        See also initial project `wiki page <http://taskman.eionet.europa.eu/projects/zope/wiki/DaViz>`_
        for the reasoning behind this project.
        
        
        Video Tutorials
        ===============
        Most of DaViz features are presented throughout a series of video tutorials available under the `EEA Web Systems Training`_ YouTube channel.
        The screencasts are divided in two playlists: Basic_ and Advanced_.

        Architecture overview
        =====================
        
        At the moment `Simile Exhibit`_ and `Google Charts`_ visualizations are
        supported. The architecture allows to extend Daviz with more

        Installation
        ============
        
        zc.buildout
        -----------
        If you are using `zc.buildout`_ and the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Update your buildout.cfg file:
        
          * Add ``eea.daviz`` to the list of eggs to install
        
          ::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            eggs =
              ...
              eea.daviz
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        
        Google Maps API Key
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Plone
        +++++
        Within ZMI -> Plone Site -> portal_properties add a plone property sheet called
        geographical_properties and inside it add a new string property
        called google_key.
        
        Zope
        ++++
        Within ZMI -> Top Folder -> manage_propertiesForm add a string property called
        google_key
        
        In this property you have to paste the Google maps API KEY, follow instruction
        https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key
        
        The Google account you use to generate the key has to be owner of the site,
        this is done by verification via Google webmaster tools.
