        .. note::
        
          Do not use this software yet: it was one of the first projects
          I wrote in Python, it is buggy, it is poorly designed. I do use it, but I
          know its bugs and limitations.
        
          I have a full rewrite in mind, but this is not my priority, so the release
          date (if any) should be quite far in the future. This rewrite can be tracked
          in branch `next <https://git.framasoft.org/spalax/chval/tree/next>`_.

        I - Description
        ---------------
        
        Program Ch'val (abbreviated chval) is a wrapper for getmail. It provides two
        features:
        
        * password are no longer stored in plain text, but are stored encrypted, using
          another password as a key;
        * chval can be run as a daemon and call getmail every X minutes.
        
        The name comes from Ferdinand Cheval, known as "le facteur Cheval" (Postman
        Cheval), a famous French postman and naive architect.
