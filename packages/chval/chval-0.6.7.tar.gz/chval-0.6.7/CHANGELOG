gams (0.6.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  This new version changes the way passwords are stored. It is necessary to run
  tool gams5to6.py (in directory "meta") to convert password file from old
  format to old format. Syntax is:
    gams5to6.py [gamsrc]
  Now, the actual changelog:
  * Using different methods to encrypt and decrypt strings: solves the
    following bugs.
    * Bug #003: long passwords are now allowed;
    * Bug #018: brackets are no longer ignored at the end of passwords.
  * Improved behaviour when Ctrl-C is hit.
  * The same password is now encrypted in a different string for different
    getmailrc files (there is no way to tell that two getmailrc files have the
    same password because their hash are the same).
  * Solved bug #007: Using strong random function.
  * Solved bug: Options --gamsdir and --version can now be used after command.
  * Solved bug #020: A daemon that was not answering to ping made client crash.
  * Solved bug in "gams fill": Password was asked for getmailrc files that
    already contained passwords.
  * Solved bug #019: Ignore getmailrc files without passwords with "gams getmail"
  * Solved bug #021: Daemon now asks password only if it needs it
  * Minor code refactoring and improvement.
