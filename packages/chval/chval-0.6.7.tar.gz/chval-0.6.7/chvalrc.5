.SH NAME
chvalrc \- Per user configuration file for chval.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
~/.chval/chvalrc

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
All options are in section \fB[options]\fP. Then, each option is set by a
line \fBname = value\fP, where \fBname\fP is the name option, listed above.
.PP
For each of these options, if the corresponding option is set in the command
line of \fBchval\fP(1), the value set in the configuration file is ignored.
.PP
.IP daemon_cycle_time
Time (in minutes) between two successive calls to \fBgetmail\fP(1) (when run
in daemon mode). Default is 60 minutes.
.IP gap
Set the time interval between two calls of \fBgetmail\fP. This is done so that,
if you have ten accounts to get mail from, you will not launch ten instances of
\fBgetmail\fP at the same time, but leave a small time interval between two
calls. Default is \fB0\fP.
.IP getmail_options
Default options to be given to each call to \fBgetmail\fP(1). Default is
\fB-n\fP.
.IP getmail_timeout
Time (in second) before which \fBgetmail\fP(1) is considered no longer
responding, and is killed. Default is a fairly long time (five minutes).
.IP getmaildir
Directory to use for configuration and data files of \fBgetmail\fP. Default is
\fB~/.getmail\fP.
.IP interface
Layout of user feedback. Available choices are \fBnone\fP, \fBlinear\fP,
\fBdefault\fP and \fBdialog\fP.
.IP parallel
Parallel mode. Can be one of \fBdaemons\fP (in client mode only: calls to
daemons are done in parallel), \fBgetmail\fP (in daemon mode or getmail mode:
calls to \fBgetmail\fP(1) are done in parallel), \fBall\fP (all of the
former), \fBnone\fP (none of the former). Default is \fBnone\fP.
