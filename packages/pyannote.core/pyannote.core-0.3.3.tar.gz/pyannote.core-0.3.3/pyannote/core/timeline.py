class Timeline(object):
    """
    Ordered set of segments.

    A timeline can be seen as an ordered set of non-empty segments (Segment).
    Segments can overlap -- though adding an already exisiting segment to a
    timeline does nothing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    segments : Segment iterator, optional
        initial set of segments
    uri : string, optional
        name of segmented resource

    Returns
    -------
    timeline : Timeline
        New timeline

    Examples
    --------
    Create a new empty timeline

        >>> timeline = Timeline()
        >>> if not timeline:
        ...    print "Timeline is empty."
        Timeline is empty.

    Add one segment (+=)

        >>> segment = Segment(0, 1)
        >>> timeline.add(segment)
        >>> if len(timeline) == 1:
        ...    print "Timeline contains only one segment."
        Timeline contains only one segment.

    Add all segments from another timeline

        >>> other_timeline = Timeline([Segment(0.5, 3), Segment(6, 8)])
        >>> timeline.update(other_timeline)

    Get timeline extent, coverage & duration

        >>> extent = timeline.extent()
        >>> print extent
        [0 --> 8]
        >>> coverage = timeline.coverage()
        >>> print coverage
        [
           [0 --> 3]
           [6 --> 8]
        ]
        >>> duration = timeline.duration()
        >>> print "Timeline covers a total of %g seconds." % duration
        Timeline covers a total of 5 seconds.

    Iterate over (sorted) timeline segments

        >>> for segment in timeline:
        ...    print segment
        [0 --> 1]
        [0.5 --> 3]
        [6 --> 8]

    Segmentation

        >>> segmentation = timeline.segmentation()
        >>> print segmentation
        [
           [0 --> 0.5]
           [0.5 --> 1]
           [1 --> 3]
           [6 --> 8]
        ]

    Gaps

        >>> timeline = timeline.copy()
        >>> print timeline
        [
           [0 --> 1]
           [0.5 --> 3]
           [6 --> 8]
        ]
        >>> print timeline.gaps()
        [
           [3 --> 6]
        ]
        >>> segment = Segment(0, 10)
        >>> print timeline.gaps(segment)
        [
           [3 --> 6]
