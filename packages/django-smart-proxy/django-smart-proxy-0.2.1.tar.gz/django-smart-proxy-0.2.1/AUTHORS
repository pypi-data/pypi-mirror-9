Django Smart Proxy was created by Matt Caldwell <matt.caldwell@gmail.com> and
is maintained by Celerity IT, LLC <opensource@celerity.com> and the generous
and talented Open Source community (http://opensource.org/).

Initially, Django Smart Proxy was based heavily on Django HTTP Proxy
(https://bitbucket.org/yvandermeer/django-http-proxy/), which was
created and maintained by Yuri van der Meer <django-http-proxy@yvandermeer.net>.

Though we've diverged (entirely) from Django HTTP Proxy, the original authors and
maintainers certainly still deserve credit, as they paved the way and provided
inspiration for Django Smart Proxy.
