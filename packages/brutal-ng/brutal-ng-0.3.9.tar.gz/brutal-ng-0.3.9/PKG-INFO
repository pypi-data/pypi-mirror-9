        Backwards compatibility
        -----------------------
        
        ``brutal-ng`` tries to be as backwards compatible as possible. The goal is
        to be able to replace ``brutal`` with ``brutal-ng`` and not to be required
        to change any plugin you wrote for the older version.

        Believe it or not, we do have some tests now. To run them you can execute::
