Version 1.4.0 - 26 Jan 2015

* Incremental base backup implementation through the reuse_backup
  global/server option. Possible values are off (disabled,
  default), copy (preventing unmodified files from being
  transferred) and link (allowing for deduplication through hard
  links).
* Store and show deduplication effects when using reuse_backup=
  link.
* Added transparent support of pg_stat_archiver (PostgreSQL 9.4) in
  check, show-server and status commands.
* Improved administration by invoking WAL maintenance at the end of
  a successful backup.
* Changed the way unused WAL files are trashed, by differentiating
  between concurrent and exclusive backup cases.
* Improved performance of WAL statistics calculation.
* Treat a missing pg_ident.conf as a WARNING rather than an error.
* Refactored output layer by removing remaining yield calls.
* Check that rsync is in the system path.
* Include history files in WAL management.
* Improved robustness through more unit tests.
* Fixed bug #55: Ignore fsync EINVAL errors on directories.
* Fixed bug #58: retention policies delete.

Version 1.3.3 - 21 Aug 2014

* Added "last_backup_max_age", a new global/server option that
  allows administrators to set the max age of the last backup in a
  catalogue, making it easier to detect any issues with periodical
  backup execution
* Improved robustness of "barman backup" by introducing two global/
  server options: "basebackup_retry_times" and
  "basebackup_retry_sleep". These options allow an administrator to
  specify, respectively, the number of attempts for a copy
  operation after a failure, and the number of seconds of wait
  before retrying
* Improved the recovery process via rsync on an existing directory
  (incremental recovery), by splitting the previous rsync call into
  several ones - invoking checksum control only when necessary
* Added support for PostgreSQL 8.3
* Minor changes:

    + Support for comma separated list values configuration options
    + Improved backup durability by calling fsync() on backup and
      WAL files during "barman backup" and "barman cron"
    + Improved Nagios output for "barman check --nagios"
    + Display compression ratio for WALs in "barman show-backup"
    + Correctly handled keyboard interruption (CTRL-C) while
      performing barman backup
    + Improved error messages of failures regarding the stop of a
      backup
    + Wider coverage of unit tests
* Bug fixes:

    + Copies "recovery.conf" on the remote server during "barman
      recover" (#45)
    + Correctly detect pre/post archive hook scripts (#41)

Version 1.3.2 - 15 Apr 2014

* Fixed incompatibility with PostgreSQL 8.4 (Closes #40, bug
  introduced in version 1.3.1)

Version 1.3.1 - 14 Apr 2014

* Added support for concurrent backup of PostgreSQL 9.2 and 9.3
  servers that use the "pgespresso" extension. This feature is
  controlled by the "backup_options" configuration option (global/
  server) and activated when set to "concurrent_backup". Concurrent
  backup allows DBAs to perform full backup operations from a
  streaming replicated standby.
* Added the "barman diagnose" command which prints important
  information about the Barman system (extremely useful for support
  and problem solving)
* Improved error messages and exception handling interface
* Fixed bug in recovery of tablespaces that are created inside the
  PGDATA directory (bug introduced in version 1.3.0)
* Fixed minor bug of unhandled -q option, for quiet mode of
  commands to be used in cron jobs (bug introduced in version
  1.3.0)
* Minor bug fixes and code refactoring

Version 1.3.0 - 3 Feb 2014

* Refactored BackupInfo class for backup metadata to use the new
  FieldListFile class (infofile module)

* Refactored output layer to use a dedicated module, in order to
  facilitate integration with Nagios (NagiosOutputWriter class)

  stdout channels (command_wrappers module)

* Refactored hook scripts management

  configuration class.

* Support for hook scripts to be executed before and after a WAL
  file is archived, through the 'pre_archive_script' and
  'post_archive_script' configuration options.

  --immediate-checkpoint command option and 'immediate_checkpoint'
  configuration option

* Implemented network compression for remote backup and recovery
  through the 'network_compression' configuration option (#19)

* Implemented the 'rebuild-xlogdb' command (Closes #27 and #28)

  directory

* Refactored remote recovery code to work the same way local
  recovery does, by performing remote directory preparation
  (assuming the remote user has the right permissions on the remote
  server)

* 'barman backup' now tries and create server directories before
  attempting to execute a full backup (#14)

* Fixed bug #22: improved documentation for tablespaces relocation

  lock file

* Fixed bug #32: xlog.db read access during cron activities

Version 1.2.3 - 5 September 2013

  to limit the I/O bandwidth (in KBPS) for backup and recovery operations
  on a per tablespace basis

* Added /etc/barman/barman.conf as default location

* Bug fix: avoid triggering the minimum_redundancy check
  on FAILED backups (thanks to Jérôme Vanandruel)

Version 1.2.0 - 31 Jan 2013

* Added the "retention_policy_mode" global/server option which defines
  the method for enforcing retention policies (currently only "auto")

* Added the "minimum_redundancy" global/server option which defines
  the minimum number of backups to be kept for a server

* Added the "retention_policy" global/server option which defines
  retention policies management based on redunancy (e.g. REDUNDANCY 4)
  or recovery window (e.g. RECOVERY WINDOW OF 3 MONTHS)

* Added retention policy support to the logging infrastructure, the
  "check" and the "status" commands

  'barman backup all' now iteratively backs up all the configured servers.

* Fixed bug #9: "9.2 issue with pg_tablespace_location()"

* Add warning in recovery when file location options have been defined
  in the postgresql.conf file (issue #10)

* Fail fast on recover command if the destination directory contains
  the ':' character (Closes: #4) or if an invalid tablespace
  relocation rule is passed

* Report an informative message when pg_start_backup() invocation
  fails because an exclusive backup is already running (Closes: #8)

Version 1.0.0 - 6 July 2012

* Backup of multiple PostgreSQL servers, with different versions. Versions
  from PostgreSQL 8.4+ are supported.

* Support for secure remote backup (through SSH)

* Management of a catalog of backups for every server, allowing users
  to easily create new backups, delete old ones or restore them

* Compression of WAL files that can be configured on a per server
  basis using compression/decompression filters, both predefined (gzip
  and bzip2) or custom

* Support for INI configuration file with global and per-server directives.
  Default location for configuration files are /etc/barman.conf or
  ~/.barman.conf. The '-c' option allows users to specify a different one

  backup, allowing DBAs to specify a point in time. The 'recover' command
  supports relocation of both the PGDATA directory and, where applicable,
  the tablespaces

* Added the '--remote-ssh-command' option to the 'recover' command for
  remote recovery of a backup. Remote recovery does not currently support
  relocation of tablespaces

  for a given server, including size of the base backup and total size
  of the related WAL segments

* Added the 'show-backup' command that shows the relevant information
  for a given backup, including time of start, size, number of related
  WAL segments and their size, etc.
