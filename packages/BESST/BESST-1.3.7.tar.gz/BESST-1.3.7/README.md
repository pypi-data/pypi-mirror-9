BESST
========

BESST is a package for scaffolding genomic assemblies. It contains several modules for e.g. building a "contig graph" from available information, obtaining scaffolds from this graph, and accurate gap size information (based on GapEst http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22923455). BESST is described in http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/281 For installation, see docs/INSTALL.md. Manual is found in docs/MANUAL.md.
