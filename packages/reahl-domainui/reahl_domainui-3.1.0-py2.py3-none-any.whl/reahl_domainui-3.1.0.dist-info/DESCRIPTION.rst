Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.

This Reahl component contains a user interface for some of the domain functionality in reahl-domainui.

See http://www.reahl.org/docs/3.1/tutorial/gettingstarted.d.html for installation instructions.
