============

A ZTFY package providing a new Bootstrap-based application management skin


What is it?
===========

MyAMS, "My Application Management Skin", is a new ZTFY package which provides a complete application
management skin based on Bootstrap. It is heavilly using AJAX and HTML5 "data" API, and already includes a few
JQuery plug-ins like DataTables or Validate.

No end-user or even developer documentation is available yet. I hope to be able to produce one as well as
a complete demonstration site as soon as possible.
