        Introduction
        ============
        
        A ZTFY package providing a new Bootstrap-based application management skin
        
        
        What is it?
        ===========
        
        MyAMS, "My Application Management Skin", is a new ZTFY package which provides a complete application
        management skin based on Bootstrap. It is heavilly using AJAX and HTML5 "data" API, and already includes a few
        JQuery plug-ins like DataTables or Validate.
        
        No end-user or even developer documentation is available yet. I hope to be able to produce one as well as
        a complete demonstration site as soon as possible.
