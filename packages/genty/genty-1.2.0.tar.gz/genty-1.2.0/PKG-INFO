        Hot in 1.2!
        -------------------------
        
        Parametrized tests where the final parameters are not determined until test
        execution time. It looks like so:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            @genty_dataset((1000, 100), (100, 1))
            def calculate(self, x_val, y_val):
                # when this is called... we've been authenticated, perhaps in
                # some Test.setUp() method.
                
                # Let's imagine that _some_function requires that authentication.
                # And it returns a 3-tuple, matching that signature of
                # of the test(s) decorated with this 'calculate' method.
                return self._some_function(x_val, y_val)
        
            @genty_dataprovider(calculate)
            def test_heavy(self, data1, data2, data3):
                ...
        
        The ``calculate()`` method is called 2 times based on the ``@genty_dataset``
        decorator, and each of it's return values define the final parameters that will
        be given to the method ``test_heavy(...)``.
        
        Previously genty only supported parameters defined at import time of the test
        module. Now heavyweight data, or data that requires other test-time data, can
        be created at test execution time.
        
        About
        -----
        
        Genty, pronounced "gen-tee", stands for "generate tests". It promotes generative 
        testing, where a single test can execute over a variety of input. Genty makes
        this a breeze.
        
        For example, consider a file sample.py containing both the code under test and
        the tests:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from genty import genty, genty_repeat, genty_dataset
            from unittest import TestCase
        
            # Here's the class under test
            class MyClass(object):
                def add_one(self, x): 
                    return x + 1
        
            # Here's the test code
            @genty
            class MyClassTests(TestCase):
                @genty_dataset(
                    (0, 1),
                    (100000, 100001),
                )
                def test_add_one(self, value, expected_result):
                    actual_result = MyClass().add_one(value)
                    self.assertEqual(expected_result, actual_result)
        
        
        Running the ``MyClassTests`` using the default unittest runner
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ python -m unittest -v sample
            test_add_one(0, 1) (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
            test_add_one(100000, 100001) (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
        
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Ran 2 tests in 0.000s
        
            OK
        
        Instead of having to write multiple independent tests for various test cases, 
        code can be refactored and parametrized using genty!
        
        It produces readable tests.
        It produces maintainable tests.
        It produces expressive tests.
        
        Another option is running the same test multiple times. This is useful in stress
        tests or when exercising code looking for race conditions. This particular test
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            @genty_repeat(3)
            def test_adding_one_to_zero(self):
                self.assertEqual(1, MyClass().add_one(0))
        
        
        would be run 3 times, producing output like
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ python -m unittest -v sample
            test_adding_one() iteration_1 (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
            test_adding_one() iteration_2 (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
            test_adding_one() iteration_3 (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
        
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Ran 3 tests in 0.001s
        
            OK
        
        The 2 techniques can be combined:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
                @genty_repeat(2)
                @genty_dataset(
                    (0, 1),
                    (100000, 100001),
                )
                def test_add_one(self, value, expected_result):
                    actual_result = MyClass().add_one(value)
                    self.assertEqual(expected_result, actual_result)
                    
        
        There are more options to explore including naming your datasets and ``genty_args``.
        
        .. code-block:: python
         
                @genty_dataset(
                    default_case=(0, 1),
                    limit_case=(999, 1000),
                    error_case=genty_args(-1, -1, is_something=False),
                )
                def test_complex(self, value1, value2, optional_value=None, is_something=True):
                    ...
         
        
        would run 3 tests, producing output like
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ python -m unittest -v sample
            test_complex(default_case) (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
            test_complex(limit_case) (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
            test_complex(error_case) (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
        
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Ran 3 tests in 0.003s
        
            OK
        
        
        The ``@genty_datasets`` can be chained together. This is useful, for example, if there are semantically different datasets
        so keeping them separate would help expressiveness.
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        	@genty_dataset(10, 100)
        	@genty_dataset('first', 'second')
        	def test_composing(self, parameter_value):
        		...
        
        
        would run 4 tests, producing output like
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ python -m unittest -v sample
            test_composing(10) (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
            test_composing(100) (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
            test_composing(u'first') (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
            test_composing(u'second') (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
        
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Ran 4 tests in 0.000s
        
            OK
        
        
        Sometimes the parameters to a test can't be determined at module load time. For example,
        some test might be based on results from some http request. And first the test needs to
        authenticate, etc. This is supported using the ``@genty_dataprovider`` decorator like so:
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            def setUp(self):
                super(MyClassTests, self).setUp()
                
                # http authentication happens
                # And imagine that _some_function is actually some http request
                self._some_function = lambda x, y: ((x + y), (x - y), (x * y))
        
            @genty_dataset((1000, 100), (100, 1))
            def calculate(self, x_val, y_val):
                # when this is called... we've been authenticated
                return self._some_function(x_val, y_val)
        
            @genty_dataprovider(calculate)
            def test_heavy(self, data1, data2, data3):
                ...
        
        
        would run 4 tests, producing output like
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
        
        	$ python -m unittest -v sample
        	test_heavy_calculate(100, 1) (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
        	test_heavy_calculate(1000, 100) (sample.MyClassTests) ... ok
        
        	----------------------------------------------------------------------
        	Ran 2 tests in 0.000s
        
        	OK
        
        Notice here how the name of the helper (``calculate``) is added to the names of the 2
        executed test cases.
        
        Like ``@genty_dataset``, ``@genty_dataprovider`` can be chained together.
        
        Enjoy!

        Notes
        -------------------------
        
        When Genty was released through version 0.2.0, it was released under the namespace
        box.test. In version 0.3.0, importing genty became easier:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from genty import genty, genty_dataset, genty_args
        
        vs.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from box.test.genty import genty, genty_dataset, genty_args
            from box.test.genty.genty_args import genty_args
        
        Starting with 1.0.0, however, you will no longer be able to import genty from box.test.
