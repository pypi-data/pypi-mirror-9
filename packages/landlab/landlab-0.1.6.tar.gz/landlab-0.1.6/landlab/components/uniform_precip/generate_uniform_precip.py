        The method keeps track of the DELTA_T such that if a storm needs to be
        generated longer than this supplied model timestep, the generator will
        return the storm in "chunks", until there is no more storm duration.
        e.g.,
        storm of intensity 1. is 4.5 long, the DELTA_T is 2., the generator 
        yields (2.,1.) -> (2.,1.) -> (0.5,1.) -> ...
        
        If DELTA_T is None or not supplied, no subdivision occurs.
        
        Once a storm has been generated, this method will follow it with the
        next interstorm, yielded as (interstorm_duration, 0.). Note that the
        interstorm will NOT be subdivided according to DELTA_T unless you set
        the flag *subdivide_interstorms* to True.
