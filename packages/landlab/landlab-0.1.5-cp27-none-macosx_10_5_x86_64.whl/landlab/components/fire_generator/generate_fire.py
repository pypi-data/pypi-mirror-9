""" generate_fire.py

This component generates random numbers using the Weibull distribution
(Weibull, 1951). No particular units must be used, but it was written with
the fire recurrence units in time (yrs).

Using the Weibull Distribution assumes two things: All elements within the study
area have the same fire regime. Each element must have (on average) a constant
fire regime during the time span of the study. 

As of Sept. 2013, fires are considered instantaneous events independent of
other fire events in the time series.
