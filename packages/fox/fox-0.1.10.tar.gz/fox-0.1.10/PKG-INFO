Description: fox
        ===
        
        fox is a set of tools and utilities for building iOS and Mac projects.
        fox is not a normal project, but rather an outlet for my deep
        frustrations with Apple’s Xcode tools. The vision for fox to provide a
        complete replacement for the Xcode build and project file system (but
        *not* an IDE or text editor.) I realize that achieving this vision is
        probably impossible, but I believe I’ll get something positive out of
        the journey.
        
        **fox is very early and not recommended for production use yet.**

        ipa
        ~~~
        
        Create a signed IPA file.
        
        ::
        
            fox ipa [-h] [--project PROJECT] --target TARGET [--config CONFIG] --identity IDENTITY --profile PROFILE [--keychain KEYCHAIN]
        
        -  ``-h`` Print help.
        -  ``--project`` Path to Xcode profile file.
        -  ``--config`` The build configuration. Defaults to ``Debug``.
        -  ``--target`` Refers to the name of the target in the Xcode project.
        -  ``--identity`` Name of the code-signing identity, i.e. ‘iPhone

        -  ``--profile`` Provisioning profile. If a valid path is supplied, that
           profile is used. Also, a name can be provided, (i.e. ‘MyApp Ad Hoc’)
           and fox with search for that provisioning profile in default
           locations (currently just
           ``~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles``).
        -  ``--keychain`` Use a keychain file instead of the default keychain.
        
        resign
        ~~~~~~

        -  ``-h`` Print help.
        -  ``--ipa`` Path to IPA file to re-sign.
        -  ``--identity`` Name of the code-signing identity, i.e. ‘iPhone
           Distribution: My Company’.
        -  ``--profile`` Provisioning profile. If a valid path is supplied, that
           profile is used. Also, a name can be provided, (i.e. ‘MyApp Ad Hoc’)
           and fox with search for that provisioning profile in default
           locations (currently just
