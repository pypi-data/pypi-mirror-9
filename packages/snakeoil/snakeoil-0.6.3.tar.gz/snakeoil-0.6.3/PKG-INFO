        ========
        snakeoil
        ========
        
        snakeoil is a python library that implements optimized versions of common
        python functionality. Some classes and functions have cpython equivalents,
        but they all have native python implementations too.

        Tests
        =====
        
        A standalone test runner is integrated in setup.py; to run, just execute::
        
            python setup.py test
        
        In addition, a tox config is provided so the testsuite can be run in a
        virtualenv setup against all supported python versions. To run tests for all
        environments just execute **tox** in the root directory of a repo or unpacked
        tarball. Otherwise, for a specific python version execute something similar to
        the following::
        
            tox -e py27
        
        Note that mock_ is required for tests if you're using anything less than python
        3.3.
