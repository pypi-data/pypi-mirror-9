# Controls whether cuts are evaluated in parallel, which requires more
# memory. If cuts are evaluated sequentially, only two BigMips need to be
# in memory at a time.
PARALLEL_CUT_EVALUATION: true
# The number of CPU cores to use in parallel cut evaluation. -1 means all
# available cores, -2 means all but one available cores, etc.
NUMBER_OF_CORES: -1
# The verbosity of parallel computation (integer from 0 to 100).
PARALLEL_VERBOSITY: 0
# Controls whether concepts are cached. Note that concept caching is only
# available if the caching backend is a database; otherwise, this setting has
# no effect, and concepts will not be cached.
CACHE_CONCEPTS: false
# Controls whether BigMips are cached and retreived.
CACHE_BIGMIPS: false
# Controls whether concepts should be normalized before being cached.
# Normalization increases the chances that a precomputed concept can be used
# again, but is expensive.
NORMALIZE_TPMS: true
# Some functions are memoized using an in-memory LRU-cache. This is the maximum
# percentage of memory that each PyPhi process' caches can use.
MAXIMUM_CACHE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE: 50
# The caching system to use. "fs" means cache the results on the local
# filesystem, in a subdirectory of the current directory; "db" means connect to
# a database and store the results there.
CACHING_BACKEND: "fs"
# The directory to use for local persistent caching on the filesystem. This
# only has an effect if the caching backend is the filesystem and not a
# database.
FS_CACHE_DIRECTORY: "__pyphi_cache__"

# In some applications of this library, you may prefer to define single-nodes
