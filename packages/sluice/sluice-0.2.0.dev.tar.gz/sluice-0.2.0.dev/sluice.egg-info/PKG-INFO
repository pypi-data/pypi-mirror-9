Description: Sluice
        ======
        Sluice is a set of tools for managing ZFS snapshots:
        
        * ``zfs-autosnapshot`` creates snapshots with automatically-generated names
        
        * ``zfs-copy`` combines ``zfs send`` and ``zfs receive``
        
        * ``zfs-sync`` does one-way synchronisation of snapshots between two datasets
        
        with several others on the way:
        
        * ``zfs-cull``
        
        * ``zfs-import``
        
        * ``zfs-export``
        
        Motivation / rationale
        ----------------------
        (combine with description?)
        
        - goals:
        
          - unix philosophy
        
            - snapshot, sync and cull can quite happily be independent operations with separate schedules
        
          - avoid config file
        
            - since tools are split up, fewer command-line options are required
        
            - schedule with cron/launchd and configure targets as args
        
            - can also use zfs user props for config
        
          - no requirement for remote installation (provided by weir)
