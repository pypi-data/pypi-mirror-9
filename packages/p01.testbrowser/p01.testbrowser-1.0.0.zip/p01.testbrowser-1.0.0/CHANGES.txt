1.0.0 (2015-03-17)
------------------

- feature: implement j01.jsonrpc and j01.dialog button and link controls.
  The current implementation supports the j01.jsonrpc and j01.dialog buttons
  and and links aout of the box. Even the j01 dialog popup is supported.

  getActivities and you will see a nice log like history.
