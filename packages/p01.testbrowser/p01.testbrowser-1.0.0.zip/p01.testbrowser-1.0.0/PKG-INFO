        1.0.0 (2015-03-17)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: implement j01.jsonrpc and j01.dialog button and link controls.
          The current implementation supports the j01.jsonrpc and j01.dialog buttons
          and and links aout of the box. Even the j01 dialog popup is supported.
          This makes jsonrpc based request/repsone testing very simple. There is
          no difference in testing a simple or jsonrpc form anymore.
        
        - feature: support a html5 like browser history implementation using
          pushState and onpopstate like history state management
        
        - feature: support j01.history.js concept given from j01.jsonrpc. Added
          implicit support for this html5 browser history concept based on given
          jsonrpc response. Also support the standard history. You can access
          the history with the method getHistory()
        
        - feature: add activities. You can dump the activities with the method
          getActivities and you will see a nice log like history.
        
        - feature: support more request methods like PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS etc
        
        - feature: added JSONRPCProxy and getJSONRPCTestProxy supporting wsgi
          application setup
        
        - feature: implement better support for ajax injection. Keep original html as
          reference for content injection as browser._dom property and offer a method
          for replace partial content. Also support response.body content as body
          attribute and json method for access application/json response.
