Metadata-Version: 1.1
Name: Deployapp
Version: 0.7.17
Summary: 
Deployapp

Deployapp is a simple module to deploy multiple Python or PHP/HTML applications on a single server.

For Python application it uses Virtualenv to isolate each application, Gunicorn+Gevent as the backend server,
Supervisor and Nginx.

For PHP/HTML sites, it just uses the path as it would in normal environment, and you must have php-fpm

Deployapp can also run scripts before and after deployment of the sites.

It can run scripts as standalone, and workers for longer background tasks.

Requirements:
    Nginx
    Gunicorn
    Supervisor
    Gevent
    Virtualenvwrapper

** TESTED ON CENTOS AND WITH PYTHON 2.7
