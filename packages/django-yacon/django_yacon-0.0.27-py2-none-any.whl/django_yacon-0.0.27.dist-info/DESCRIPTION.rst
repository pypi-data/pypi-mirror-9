Yacon is a django app for building websites based on a CMS.  Yacon provides methods for managing hierarchical, multi-lingual page content across multple sites.  Yacon ships with ckedit and uses AJAX calls to allow the user to do inline WYSIWYG editing of their web content.  Yacon does not provide any design or templating tools, and so is not a full CMS, but provides enough to support CMS features on any django site you are already building.
