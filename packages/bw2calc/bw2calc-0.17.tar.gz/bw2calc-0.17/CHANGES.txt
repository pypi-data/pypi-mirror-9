- BUGFIX: Fix handling of nested dependent databases

0.16.1 (2014-12-05)
===================

- CHANGE: Better documentation for most code.
- BUGFIX: Graph traversal handles most coproducts, and raises sensible errors when it can't.

0.16 (2014-08-03)
=================

- FEATURE: Changes in MatrixBuilder should make normal static LCA calculations about three times faster.

0.15.1 (2014-07-30)
===================

Update dependencies.

0.15 (2014-06-11)
=================

0.13 (2014-04-16)
=================

- BREAKING CHANGE: LCA.fix_dictionaries now sets/uses ``_mapped_dict`` to determine if ``fix_dictionaries`` has been called.

0.12 (2014-02-13)
=================

- BREAKING CHANGE: Matrix builder will only include parameter array rows that are correctly mapped, instead of raising an error when unmapped rows occur. This behaviour can be turned off by passing ``drop_missing=False``.

===================

- BUGFIX: Change column names in method matrix building to be consistent with bw2data 0.11

- BREAKING CHANGE: Graph traversal was reworked, and some functionality for interpreting the output was moved to ``bw2analyzer``.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Deleted ``SimpleRegionalizedLCA`` class. Regionalization will be provided in bw2regional.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Deleted initial sensitivity work, moved for now to branch, as it was not yet usable.
- FEATURE: Much better and more thorough documentation.
- FEATURE: Improved testing and test coverage
