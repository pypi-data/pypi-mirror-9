Changes
=======

0.3.1 (2015-03-29)
------------------

- Turned former `diceware` module into a Python package. This is to
  fix `bug #1 Wordlists aren't included during installation
  <https://github.com/ulif/diceware/issues/1>`_, this time really.
  Wordlists will from now on be stored inside the `diceware` package.
  Again many thanks to `conorsch <https://github.com/conorsch>`_ who
  digged deep into the matter and also came up with a very considerable
  solution.
- Use readthedocs theme in docs.
