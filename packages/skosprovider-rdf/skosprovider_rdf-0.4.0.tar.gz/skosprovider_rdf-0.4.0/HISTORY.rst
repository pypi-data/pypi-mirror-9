0.4.0 (03-03-2015)
------------------

- Allow dumping a single conceptscheme to RDF. This does not dump the entire
  conceptscheme with all it's concepts or collections, just information on the
  conceptscheme itself and it's top concepts.
- Allow dumping a single concept or collection to RDF, and not just an entire
  conceptscheme with all concepts or collections.
- Add skos:inScheme information to RDF dumps.
- Better handling of dc(t):identifier. When reading an RDF file both 
  dcterms:identifier and dc:identifier are considered when analysing the 
  identifier. During dumping, we also dump to dcterms:identifier.

- Dumping to an RDF file now also adds notes to a Collection, not just to a
  Concept.
