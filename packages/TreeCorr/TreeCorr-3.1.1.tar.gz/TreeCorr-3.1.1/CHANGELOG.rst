- Turned off some C++-layer debugging lines that I had accidentally left on.

API changes:
------------

- Changed class names G2Correlation -> GGCorrelation, N2Correlation ->
  NNCorrelation, and K2Correlation -> KKCorrelation.  I realized that I had
  been kind of inconsistent in my use of G2 vs GG to mean the two-point
  shear correaltion.  In most places in the docs and such I use GG, but then
  I made the class name G2Correlation.  Considering that g1,g2 are the shear
  components, I think this may be confusing.  Plus, when I eventually do the 
  various three point functions, I'll want NGG, NNG, GGG, etc.  So I corrected
  my poor design choice and changed this class to GGCorrelation.  Similarly
  for the other two auto-correlations. (#9)
- Changed the config parameters g2_file_name -> gg_file_name, n2_file_name ->
  nn_file_name, and k2_file_name -> kk_file_name for the same reason as above.
  In this case though, I kept the old parameter names as valid aliases for the
  new names for backwards compatibility with existing config files.  With
  verbose >= 1, you will get a warning about the name change, but it will still
  work. (#9)


Changes to output files:
------------------------

- Removed the extra dots I put in the headers of the output files.  They were
  meant to help visually separate the columns, but it confuses some automatic
  parsers (like astropy as pointed out by Joe Zuntz). (#14)


New features:
-------------

- Switched the documentation to use Restructured Text markup and put the
  documentation online using Sphinx. (#9)
- Added a warning if a file_list does not have any entries. (#10)
- Added a warning if Catalog is passed an input array that is not 1-d.
  If will also automatically reshape it to 1-d. (#11)


Bug fixes:
----------

- Fixed how setup.py checks what kind of compiler is being used when the
  compiler is called simply 'cc'.  It should now detect gcc more reliably and
  so use OpenMP on those systems. (#7)
- Fixed an error in the handling of file_name as a list of file names. (#10)
- Allowed verbose parameter to correctly reset the logging verbosity on calls
  to Catalog, etc.  It used to only get set correctly on the first call, so if
  later values of verbose were different, they did not work right. (#11)
- Fixed some errors in the sample.params file. (#12)
