"""
Note on using the setup.py:
setup.py operates in 2 modes that are based on the presence of the 'dev' file in the root of the project.
 - When 'dev' is present, Cython will be used to compile the .pyx sources. This is the development mode
   (as you get it in the git repository).
 - When 'dev' is absent, C/C++ compiler will be used to compile the .cpp sources (that were prepared in
   in the development mode). This is the distribution mode (as you get it on PyPI).

This way the package can be used without or with an incompatible version of Cython.

The idea comes from: https://github.com/MattShannon/bandmat
