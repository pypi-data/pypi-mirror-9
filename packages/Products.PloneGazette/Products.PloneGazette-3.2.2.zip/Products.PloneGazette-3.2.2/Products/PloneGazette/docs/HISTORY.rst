3.2 (2012-02-09)
================

- Added backwards-compatible patch for Plone 4.1.3, TinyMCE 1.2.9
  which fixes error messages when editing a Newsletter.
  [morphex]

- Added more Norwegian translations and improved some of them.

- Added support for internal-links which didn't have the CSS class
  set.

  [nteixeira, sdemagny, vincentfretin]

- Added plone.app.discussion compatibility.
  [fdelia, keul, vincentfretin]

- Added a migration step that'll try and make private all
  NewsletterBTree objects.  The devastating effect of these becoming
  public during the upgrade process is that the Google bot will
  delete all your subscriptions.  [nouri]

- Fallback to 'MailHost.send' if 'MailHost.secureSend' is not
  available.  [nouri]

- Support specifying the id of the MailHost to use through an
  environment variable.  [nouri]

3.1.1 (2009-10-22)
==================

- Fixed "Link to member preferences does not work" (#63). Thanks to Gauthier
  Bastien for bug report.
  [naro]

- Added separate subscriber_workflow which allows to edit subscribers
  objects anonymously. Please read UPGRADE.txt how to run GS upgrade step to
  switch existing subscribers to this workflow.
  [naro]

3.1.0 (2009-10-18)
==================

- Add the possibility to define a newsletter header similar to
  newsletter footer.  And add a field for defining CSS style
  properties that go into the <body> element of the newsletter
  that's sent out (but not into Plone's view of the
  newsletter). [Ingo Van den Broeck, nouri]

- Update the role mappings of a Subscriber during creation.  We got
  Unauthorized errors when trying to edit the subscriber
  anonymously.  This was fixed by clicking the 'Update security
  settings' button on the portal_workflow tool.  This code fixes it
  too.  [maurits]

- Subscriber class now has a portal_type attribute. This fixes a bug
  with failing to create new subscribers while having a contentrule with a
  portal_type condition active. [Huub Bouma]

- Fixed bug where a faulty email address (without even a '@') would result
  in a zope error instead of a template which renders the error. [reinout]

- listFolderContents and getFolderContents moved back to the subclasses.
  Plone 3 has another implementation of the folder listing.
  [naro]

3.0.0 (2008-07-11)
==================

- fixed test newsletter if testing user were subscribed but not activated
  [naro]

- all emails are now encoded. In case of utf8 emails, these will be generated
  in base64 encoding. Subject is encoded too (if applicable). This may
  fix situations described in #37 and #40.
  [naro]

- Fixed listing of NewsletterRichReference. This fixes #36
  [Guido A.J. Stevens, naro]

- added changeRelativeToAbsolute method which converts all relative links
  generated by Kupu to absolute links.
  [Ralph Jacobs, 4D]

- Moved listFolderContents and getFolderContents to PNLBase class. This
  fixes #34.
  [naro]

3.0.0-beta2 (2007-12-06)
========================

- fixed initialization of subscribers catalog. Thanks to Wouter Vanden Hove

3.0.0-beta1 (2007-12-03)
========================

- see UPGRADE.txt for upgrade notes, see README.txt for general installation and usage notes.
- only major change against 2.5 version is creation of subscribers catalog
  inside NewsletterTheme objects. All Subscribers are stored in the subscribers_catalog
  to be easily and fast found and listed.
- Content types are still CMF based, code is not polished and optimized.
- removed Extensions/ dir, added basic GS profile with content types and skin layer
- use secureSend. Emails are generated as email.Message.Message instances and not strings
- make all forms and object manipulation working in Plone 3
- cutoff Plone 3.0 compatible version. Dropped Plone 2.1 and 2.5 compatibility.
  If you want to use PloneGazette on Plone 2.5, use 2.5 branch and versions in
  PloneGazette 2.5 line.

2.5.0-beta1 (2007-11-25)
========================

- fixed HTML markup in subscriber edit form to support <label> in radio boxes
- fixed testSendToMe
- fixed toLocalizedTime definition (plone 2.5). Thanks to Andrew Kornilov for
  pointing to it.
  [naro]

2.5.0-alpha1 (2007-11-24)
=========================

- replaced toPortalTime with toLocalizedTime in Newsletter view. Fixes #11
- added getFolderContents method to the NewsletterTheme.
  This fixes #4 - Subscribers do not appear in folder listing or view
- do not use secureSend in combination with email.Message.Message.
  There is bug in SecureMailHost used in plone 2.5 which prevents this
  combination (#6504)
- trying to stay compatible with Plone 2.1 for the moment
- removed metadata and duplicate Contents tab from newslettertheme and
  newsletter
  [naro]
