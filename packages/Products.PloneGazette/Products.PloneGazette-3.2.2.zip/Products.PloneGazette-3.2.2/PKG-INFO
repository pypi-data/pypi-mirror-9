        The look of the HTML newsletter
        ===============================
        
        You may change globally the way the newsletter are rendered by
        customizing the "newsletter_mua_formatter" template. Be very
        careful to follow the instructions in the comments of this
        template: "newsletter_mua_formatter" is **not** a Plone template
        like the others.
        
        You may have your own HTML newsletter formatter. Copy
        "newsletter_mua_formatter" to
        "/yourplone/skins/custom/my_mua_formatter" or anywhere else in the
        skins path. You just need to modify your NewsletterCentral, setting
        the "Newsletter render template (TALES)" field to
        "nocall:here/my_mua_formatter".
        
        Add your own recipients list
        ============================
        
        Just write a script that returns a list of tuples in the form ::
        
            [(email, html, changeUrl), ...]
        
        * "email" is a mail address
        * "html" is "HTML" to receive HTML newsletters and "Text" for plain text newsletters
        * "changeUrl" is an URL where the user may change his newsletter preferences
        
        Example ::
        
            [('tom@somewhere.com',
              'HTML',
              'http://www.myplone.com/personalize_form'),
             ('jerry@elsewhere.net',
              'Text',
              'http://www.myplone.com/personalize_form'),
             ...]
        
        Call that script "/yourplone/skins/custom/additionalSubscribers" or
        anywhere else in the skins path. Modify your NewsletterCentral
        setting the "Extra recipients (TALES)" field to
        "nocall:here/additionalSubscribers".
        
        In example, you could add newsletter settings in the member
        preferences of your Plone site and make a script that gathers all
        subscribers and related options.
        
        IN ANY CASE, PLEASE TEST THIS SCRIPT IN A STANDALONE WAY BEFORE
        USING IT IN A NEWSLETTERCENTRAL. EXCEPTIONS OR INVALID FORMATS
        COULD SCREW ALL UP.
        
        Permissions
        ===========
        
        Please be sure your Subscribers folder is always **private**. Otherwise Anonymous 
        will be able to see all your subscribers.
        
        Subscriber objects itself uses one_state_workflow to be always accessible to 
        anonymous (all users has to be able change own settings and we can't distinguish
        between anonymous users).
        
        Instead of using the standard CMF/Plone permissions ("Add portal
        content"), PloneNewsletter comes with its own set of permissions
        such you can tweak the roles that can add/manage newsletter related
        resources.
        
        * PNL Add Newsletter Theme, PNL Change Newsletter Theme
        * PNL Add Newsletter, PNL Change Newsletter
        * PNL Add Subscriber, PNL Change Subscriber
        
        More informations
        =================
        
        The NewsletterReference type allows to refer any portal_type
        of the site within the newsletter.
        
        In the Newsletter the Referece has a title, a description, and
        an ordered list of the referenced objects.
        In our usecase we need to build a newsletter with different
        reference objects. They need
        
        * Title
        * Descriptive text with richtext functionality (text is not taken
          from the referred content type)
        * an optional image
        * and of course the reference to a content object within the portal
        
        The differences to the currently availablle NewsletterReference are
        
        * richtext edit (to have more freedom of design within the newsletter)
        * preview image (to provide icons for types that don't have a preview
          image, and also to provide a different format that fits the layout
          of the newsletter)
        
        If you have any questions about NewsletterRichReference 
        contact <harald.friessnegger@lovelysystems.com> (fRiSi on #lovely)

        - Release for Plone-4.2.2. [taito]
        
        3.2 (2012-02-09)
        ================
        
        - Added backwards-compatible patch for Plone 4.1.3, TinyMCE 1.2.9
          which fixes error messages when editing a Newsletter.
          [morphex]
        
        - Added more Norwegian translations and improved some of them.
        
        - Added support for internal-links which didn't have the CSS class
          set.

        - Added a migration step that'll try and make private all
          NewsletterBTree objects.  The devastating effect of these becoming
          public during the upgrade process is that the Google bot will
          delete all your subscriptions.  [nouri]
        
        - Fallback to 'MailHost.send' if 'MailHost.secureSend' is not

          environment variable.  [nouri]
        
        3.1.1 (2009-10-22)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed "Link to member preferences does not work" (#63). Thanks to Gauthier
          Bastien for bug report.
          [naro]
        
        - Added separate subscriber_workflow which allows to edit subscribers
          objects anonymously. Please read UPGRADE.txt how to run GS upgrade step to
          switch existing subscribers to this workflow.
          [naro]
        
        3.1.0 (2009-10-18)
        ==================
        
        - Add the possibility to define a newsletter header similar to
          newsletter footer.  And add a field for defining CSS style
          properties that go into the <body> element of the newsletter
          that's sent out (but not into Plone's view of the
          newsletter). [Ingo Van den Broeck, nouri]
        
        - Update the role mappings of a Subscriber during creation.  We got
          Unauthorized errors when trying to edit the subscriber
          anonymously.  This was fixed by clicking the 'Update security
          settings' button on the portal_workflow tool.  This code fixes it
          too.  [maurits]
        
        - Subscriber class now has a portal_type attribute. This fixes a bug
          with failing to create new subscribers while having a contentrule with a
          portal_type condition active. [Huub Bouma]
        
        - Fixed bug where a faulty email address (without even a '@') would result
          in a zope error instead of a template which renders the error. [reinout]
        
        - listFolderContents and getFolderContents moved back to the subclasses.
          Plone 3 has another implementation of the folder listing.
          [naro]
        
        3.0.0 (2008-07-11)
        ==================
        
        - fixed test newsletter if testing user were subscribed but not activated
          [naro]
        
        - all emails are now encoded. In case of utf8 emails, these will be generated
          in base64 encoding. Subject is encoded too (if applicable). This may
          fix situations described in #37 and #40.
          [naro]
        
        - Fixed listing of NewsletterRichReference. This fixes #36
          [Guido A.J. Stevens, naro]
        
        - added changeRelativeToAbsolute method which converts all relative links
          generated by Kupu to absolute links.
          [Ralph Jacobs, 4D]
        
        - Moved listFolderContents and getFolderContents to PNLBase class. This
          fixes #34.
          [naro]
        
        3.0.0-rc2 (2008-03-22)
        ======================
        
        - added missing i18n:domain to browser/configure.zcml [hannosch]
        - fixed getUrl -> getURL [naro]
        
        3.0.0-rc1 (2008-02-17)
        ======================
        
        - fixed attribute error when accessing NewsletterBTree folder contents (#30)
        - fixed UnicodeError when activation subject or body contains non ascii
          characters
        - PG is registered to all skins layers
        - another subscribers catalog fix. Catalog is based on CMFCore. catalog tool instead of ZCatalog
        
        3.0.0-beta2 (2007-12-06)
        ========================
        
        - fixed initialization of subscribers catalog. Thanks to Wouter Vanden Hove
        
        3.0.0-beta1 (2007-12-03)
        ========================
        
        - see UPGRADE.txt for upgrade notes, see README.txt for general installation and usage notes.
        - only major change against 2.5 version is creation of subscribers catalog
          inside NewsletterTheme objects. All Subscribers are stored in the subscribers_catalog
          to be easily and fast found and listed.
        - Content types are still CMF based, code is not polished and optimized.
        - removed Extensions/ dir, added basic GS profile with content types and skin layer
        - use secureSend. Emails are generated as email.Message.Message instances and not strings
        - make all forms and object manipulation working in Plone 3
        - cutoff Plone 3.0 compatible version. Dropped Plone 2.1 and 2.5 compatibility.
          If you want to use PloneGazette on Plone 2.5, use 2.5 branch and versions in
          PloneGazette 2.5 line.
        
        2.5.0-beta1 (2007-11-25)
        ========================
        
        - fixed HTML markup in subscriber edit form to support <label> in radio boxes
        - fixed testSendToMe
        - fixed toLocalizedTime definition (plone 2.5). Thanks to Andrew Kornilov for
          pointing to it.
          [naro]
        
        2.5.0-alpha1 (2007-11-24)
        =========================
        
        - replaced toPortalTime with toLocalizedTime in Newsletter view. Fixes #11
        - added getFolderContents method to the NewsletterTheme.
          This fixes #4 - Subscribers do not appear in folder listing or view
        - do not use secureSend in combination with email.Message.Message.
          There is bug in SecureMailHost used in plone 2.5 which prevents this
          combination (#6504)
        - trying to stay compatible with Plone 2.1 for the moment
        - removed metadata and duplicate Contents tab from newslettertheme and
          newsletter
          [naro]
