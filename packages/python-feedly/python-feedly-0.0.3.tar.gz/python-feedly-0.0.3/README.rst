.. code-block:: python

	FEEDLY_REDIRECT_URI = "http://fabreadly.com/auth_callback"
	FEEDLY_CLIENT_ID="client_id"
	FEEDLY_CLIENT_SECRET="client_secret"

	def get_feedly_client(token=None):
		if token:
			return FeedlyClient(token=token, sandbox=True)
		else:
			return FeedlyClient(
								client_id=FEEDLY_CLIENT_ID, 
								client_secret=FEEDLY_CLIENT_SECRET,
								sandbox=True
			)
	def auth(request):   
		feedly = get_feedly_client()
		# Redirect the user to the feedly authorization URL to get user code
		code_url = feedly.get_code_url(FEEDLY_REDIRECT_URI)    
		return redirect(code_url)


After getting a code, you may exchange it for an access token and a refresh token.


.. code-block:: python

	def callback(request):
		code=request.GET.get('code','')
		if not code:
			return HttpResponse('The authentication is failed.')
		
		feedly = get_feedly_client()
		
		#response of access token
		res_access_token = feedly.get_access_token(FEEDLY_REDIRECT_URI, code)
		# user id
		if 'errorCode' in res_access_token.keys():
			return HttpResponse('The authentication is failed.')
			 
		id = res_access_token['id']
		access_token=res_access_token['access_token']

	# get user's subscription
	def feed(access_token):
			'''get user's subscription'''
			feedly = get_feedly_client()
			user_subscriptions = feedly.get_user_subscriptions(access_token)
