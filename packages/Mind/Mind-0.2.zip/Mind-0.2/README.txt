Mind
=====
Mind is library for games in Python
Mind is divided on two parts (for now): Mind.Knowledge and Mind.Orientation (and Mind.Test but it's only for testing)
Next version will be 0.2
In that version Mind.Imagination will be added
For help see Documentation, use Mind.Tets file (and try to understand its code) and see pro_1.py file (on GitHub).
