WARNING! This code is speciallized for use on eudplib
- Default player of rawtrigger is 'All Player'.
- Only conditions/actions used in eudplib are declared
- Condition/Action input filtering (& 0xFFFFFFFF thing) are only applied to
  player & number section of Deaths/SetDeaths
Note this when using this code outside of eudplib.
