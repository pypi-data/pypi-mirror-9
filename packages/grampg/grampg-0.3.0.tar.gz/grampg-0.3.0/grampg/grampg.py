    The generator object.

    A generator instance undergoes three phases during its existance: create it
    with the character sets to choose from, specify it by calling its methods
    finalizing in a call to :meth:`done`, and generate passwords
    with it by calling its :meth:`generate` method.

    Character sets should not be modified once the generator is
    instantiated. If other character sets are required, a new instance should
    be used.

    During the specification, repeated calls to the same method (consecutively
    or otherwise) overrides previous calls, so it is not an error to call them
    more than once. Specification is over after a call :meth:`~Generator.done`
    succeds. Once *done*, the generator cannot be further spec'ed, and only
    calls to :meth:`generate` are valid (although it is possible to call
    :meth:`done` over and over again, it does not have effect).
