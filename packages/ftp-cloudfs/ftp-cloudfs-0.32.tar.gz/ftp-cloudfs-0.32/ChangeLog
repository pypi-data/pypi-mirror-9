 * 0.32
 - Fixes to hide-part-dir by John Leach to support any segment format.

2014-12-11 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.31
 - New permit-foreign-addresses configuration token to expose that
   functionality from pyftpdlib. This is useful when the control
   connection is proxified. Check the example configuration file for
   more information. Thanks to Koert van der Veer for the patch.
 - swiftclient requirement updated to be >= 2.1.0.
 - Tokens won't be reused in large files support to avoid broken
   uploads because of expired tokens.
 - Fixed a bug in large files support with UTF-8 encoded filenames.
 - Added error translation in two methods of the file emulation. Accessing
   an unexistent file was resulting in an unhandled exception instead of
   sending an FTP error to the client. Thanks to John Leach for the report.
 - A --config command line option has been added to specify an alternative
   configuration option that will be used instead of the default one in /etc.

2014-10-06 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.30
 - Migrated to swiftclient >= 2.0.0 and requests. This means older
   versions of the library are not supported, so please upgrade.
 - Added new configuration token "insecure" to allow connections to
   auth servers with invalid SSL certs (eg, self-signed certificates).

   This is a potentially disruptive release, please test before upgrading
   your production systems!

2014-09-19 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.29
 - Fixed large file support to support non-ascii encodings.

   Thanks to Ã‰douard Puginier for the report!

   with long time FTP sessions.
 - Added new configuration token "rackspace-service-network" to support
   Rackspace's service network as implemented in swiftclient.

2014-05-21 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.27
 - Added new configuration token "passive-ports" to expose pyftpdlib's
   functionality. Check ftpcloudfs.conf.example for details.
 - Explicitly close connections instead of relying on the garbage
   collector. Some compatibility code has been added for those using
   python-swiftclient < 1.9.0.

2014-05-14 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.26.2
 - Changed setup.py to force swiftclient 1.9.0 as version 2.x uses
   Requests and we're currently incompatible.

2014-04-10 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.26.1
 - Fixed a bug in token cache code with auth 2.0 (keystone) when used
   with memcache. The same username in different tenants could get the
   same auth token.

   This bug was introduced in 0.24.

   Thanks to Igor Belikov for the report and the patch!

 - Auth 2.0 support in tests has been improved. 

2014-03-20 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.26
  This release improves large file support:
  - Large file rename (manifest only, not the parts).
  - Delete large files (manifest and parts are removed).
  - Hide ".part" directory in directory listings.

    to Pedro Perez for the patch!
  - Copyright year bump

2013-12-01 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.25.1, 0.25.2
  - Fixed a bug in ObjectStorageFS when used in "delayed authentication"
    mode that resulted in a information leak vulnerability in sftp-cloudfs.

    Under certain conditions it was possible to serve a cached directory
    listing from a different user.

2013-11-15 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.25
  - Large file support added. The server will split big files in parts
    to go over the object size limit of Swift. See 'split-large-files'
    configuration token.

    For further info please read:
  
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_large_objects.html

2013-11-08 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

  - Updated requirements to pyftpdlib >= 1.3.0.

2013-10-17 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.24.2
  - Fixed a bug in token cache code. The server could get stuck with
    a cached invalid token not requesting a new one.

2013-10-12 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.24.1
  - Fixed a small bug that prevented users with no privileges to list
    the root directory to access containers with the appropriate ACL.
    This was affecting sftp-cloudfs mainly as some SFTP clients will
    perform 'stat' over a directory before 'cd'. The problem  was
    introduced in 0.23.

2013-10-11 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.24
  - Introduced an auth token cache when memcache is available.
    Thanks to Vil Surkin for the RFE.

2013-10-02 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.23.4
  - Fixed a bug listing a directory with more than 10k objects that
    included a virtual directory ('subdir') as last object of a 10k batch.

2013-09-29 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.23.3
  - Fixed a bug that was preventing non privileged users to log in. That
    was introduced in 0.23.2.

2013-09-29 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

2013-08-29 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.23
  ftpcloudfs ported from python-cloudfiles to python-swiftclient
  - Using python-swiftfiles instead of the abandoned python-cloudfiles
  - The code has been tidied up for better maintainability and there are 
    some performance improvements. The functionality should be the same,
	but please test this release before upgrading your production systems!

  From now on the project will focus on OpenStack Object Storage (swift);
  although Rackspace Cloud Files is still compatible.

  If you want to keep using python-cloudfiles, please use ftp-cloudfs 0.22.

2013-07-11 Juan J. Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * 0.22
  Cache performance improvements
  - Cache management has been improved limiting the calls to memcache
