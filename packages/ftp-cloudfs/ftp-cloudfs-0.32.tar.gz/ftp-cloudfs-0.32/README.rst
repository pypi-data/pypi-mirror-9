DESCRIPTION
===========

ftp-cloudfs is a ftp server acting as a proxy to `OpenStack Object Storage (swift)`_.
It allow you to connect via any FTP client to do upload/download or create containers.

By default the server will bind to port 2021 which allow to be run as a non
root/administrator user.

.. _OpenStack Object Storage (Swift): http://launchpad.net/swift

It supports pseudo-hierarchical folders/directories as described in the `OpenStack Object Storage API`_.

.. _OpenStack Object Storage API: http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-object-storage/developer/content/


REQUIREMENTS
============

- Python 2 >= 2.6
- python-swiftclient >= 2.1.0 - https://github.com/openstack/python-swiftclient/
- pyftpdlib >= 1.3.0 - http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/
- python-daemon >= 1.5.5 - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/
- python-memcache >= 1.45 - http://www.tummy.com/Community/software/python-memcached/

IMPORTANT: pyftpdlib 1.2.0 has a couple of known issues (memory leak, file descriptor leak) and it shouldn't
be used in production systems.

python-swiftclient 2.x uses Requests and it is currently incompatible with ftp-cloudfs < 0.30.


Operating Systems
=================

ftp-cloudfs is developed and tested in Ubuntu and Debian Linux distributions but it should work on any
Unix-like (including Mac OS X) as long as you install the requirements listed above.


INSTALL
=======

Use standard setup.py directives ie.::

  python setup.py install

Or if you have `pip`_ installed you can just run::

  pip install ftp-cloudfs

which will install ftp-cloudfs with all the required dependencies.

We also provide a `requirements.txt` file in case you want to install all the dependencies using `pip`
without installing ftp-cloudfs::

  pip install -r requirements.txt

ftp-cloudfs has been `included in Debian Jessie`_.

.. _`pip`: https://pip.pypa.io/
.. _included in Debian Jessie: http://packages.debian.org/jessie/ftp-cloudfs


USAGE
======

The install should have created a /usr/bin/ftpcloudfs (or whatever
prefix defined in your python distribution or command line arguments)
which can be used like this:

  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORT, --port=PORT  Port to bind the server (default: 2021)
  -b BIND_ADDRESS, --bind-address=BIND_ADDRESS
                        Address to bind (default: 127.0.0.1)
  -a AUTHURL, --auth-url=AUTHURL
                        Authentication URL (required)
  --insecure            Allow to access servers without checking SSL certs
  --memcache=MEMCACHE   Memcache server(s) to be used for cache (ip:port)
  -v, --verbose         Be verbose on logging
  -f, --foreground      Do not attempt to daemonize but run in foreground
  -l LOG_FILE, --log-file=LOG_FILE
                        Log File: Default stdout when in foreground
  --syslog              Enable logging to the system logger (daemon facility)
  --pid-file=PID_FILE   Pid file location when in daemon mode
  --uid=UID             UID to drop the privilige to when in daemon mode
  --gid=GID             GID to drop the privilige to when in daemon mode
  --keystone-auth       Use auth 2.0 (Keystone, requires keystoneclient)
  --keystone-region-name=REGION_NAME
                        Region name to be used in auth 2.0
  --keystone-tenant-separator=TENANT_SEPARATOR
                        Character used to separate tenant_name/username in
                        auth 2.0 (default: TENANT.USERNAME)
  --keystone-service-type=SERVICE_TYPE
                        Service type to be used in auth 2.0 (default: object-
                        store)
  --keystone-endpoint-type=ENDPOINT_TYPE
                        Endpoint type to be used in auth 2.0 (default:
                        publicURL)

The defaults can be changed using a configuration file (by default in
/etc/ftpcloudfs.conf). Check the example file included in the package.


CACHE MANAGEMENT
================

`OpenStack Object Storage (Swift)`_ is an object storage and not a real file system.
This proxy simulates enough file system functionality to be used over FTP, but it
has a performance impact.

To improve the performance a cache is used. It can be local or external (with
Memcache). By default a local cache is used, unless one or more Memcache servers
are configured.

If you're using just one client the local cache may be fine, but if you're using
several connections, configuring an external cache is highly recommended.

If an external cache is available it will be used to cache authentication tokens too
so any Memcache server must be secured to prevent unauthorized access as it could be
possible to associate a token with a specific user (not trivial) or even use the
cache key (MD5 hash) to brute-force the user password.


AUTH 2.0
========

By default ftp-cloudfs will use Swift auth 1.0, that is compatible with `OpenStack Object Storage`
using `swauth`_ auth middleware and Swift implementations such as `Rackspace Cloud Files` or
`Memset's Memstore Cloud Storage`.

Optionally `OpenStack Identity Service 2.0`_ can be used. Currently python-keystoneclient (0.3.2+
recommended) is required to use auth 2.0 and it can be enabled with ``keystone-auth`` option.

You can provide a tenant name in the FTP login user with TENANT.USERNAME (using a dot as
separator). Please check the example configuration file for further details.

.. _Memset's Memstore Cloud Storage: https://www.memset.com/cloud/storage/


LARGE FILE SUPPORT
==================

The object storage has a limit on the size of a single uploaded object (by default this is 5GB).
Files larger than that can be split in parts and merged back on the fly using a manifest file.

ftp-cloudfs supports this transparently with the *split-large-files* configuration token, setting
it to the number of megabytes wanted to use for each part (disabled by default).

When a *FILE* is larger than the specified amount of MB, a *FILE.part* directory will be created and
*n* parts will be created splitting the file automatically. The original file name will be used to
store the manifest. If the original file is downloaded, the parts will be served as it was a single file.

The *FILE.part* directory can be removed from directory listings using the *hide-part-dir* configuration
token. Please be aware that the directory will still be visible when accessing the storage using
swift API.
