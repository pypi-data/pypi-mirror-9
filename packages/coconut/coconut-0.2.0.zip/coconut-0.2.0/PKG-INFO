Description: Coconut
        =======
        
        *Coconut is a variant of Python built for simple, elegant functional programming.*
        
        Python is a beautiful, powerful language. Unfortunately, much of that beauty goes away when programming in a functional style. While functional programming in Python technically works, it's cumbersome and difficult. The Coconut Programming Language is the solution to that problem, with a syntax derived from Python but with new features that allow for truly Pythonic functional programming, and a compiler that produces stand-alone Python code for easy interoperability with existing libraries and modules.
        
        Coconut can be found on GitHub_ and PyPI_.
        
        A full **introduction and tutorial** of the Coconut programming language can be found in the HELP_ file. If you don't know what you're doing, you should start there.
        
        The full Coconut **documentation** can be found in the DOCS_ file. If you're looking for info about a specific feature, you should go there.
