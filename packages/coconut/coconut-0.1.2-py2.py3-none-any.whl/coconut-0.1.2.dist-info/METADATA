Coconut
=======

*Coconut is a variant of Python built for simple, elegant functional programming.*

Python is a beautiful, powerful language. Unfortunately, much of that beauty goes away when programming in a functional style. This is because Python was built to be an object-oriented programming language, object-oriented use cases the most heavily considered in the design of the language. While functional programming in Python technically works, it's cumbersome and difficult. Coconut is the solution to that problem, a functional-programming-focused language that compiles to Python.

Getting Started
---------------

Coconut can be found on GitHub_ and PyPI_.

A full **introduction and tutorial** of the Coconut programming language can be found in the HELP_ file.

The full Coconut **documentation** can be found in the DOCS_ file.
