The PySpectrograph package holds the tasks to model and analyze spectroscopic
data from grating spectrographs.

These tasks include:

Spectrograph--The basic equations and components of a spectrograph
Models--models for different spectrographs
Spectra--classes for the handling of spectra
WavelengthSolutions--Methods for calculating the wavelength solution
Identify--Tasks to measure the wavelength solution 
Utilities--General useful tasks
