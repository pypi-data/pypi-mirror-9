Description of the `sphinxcontrib-packages` Sphinx Extension
============================================================

|sources| |pypi| |documentation| |license|

This `sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`__ extension provides some directives
to see what tools are available on the compiling machine. I wrote this because
I was developping a sphinx extension calling system commands, and I wanted to
be able to use is on `readthedocs <http://readthedocs.org>`__, but I did not
know which tools were available there: the `official list of installed tools
<https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/builds.html#packages-installed-in-the-build-environment>`__
is pretty scarceâ€¦

Install
-------

This module is compatible with both python 2 and 3.

See the end of list for a (quick and dirty) Debian package.

    pip install sphinxcontrib-packages

* Quick and dirty Debian (and Ubuntu?) package

  This requires `stdeb <https://github.com/astraw/stdeb>`_ to be installed::
