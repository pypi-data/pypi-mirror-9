Grow is a modern, social, rapid, collaborative CMS and static site generator that helps teams build high-quality web sites. Grow's mission is to bring joy to building and launching web sites. This is the SDK. Thanks for checking it out.

The best place to learn more about the project is http://growsdk.org.

Here are some of the key features:

- portable: Sites are file-based and backed by Git, so they work with your favorite tools. The SDK runs on your machine and in the cloud.
- content-friendly: Content files are managed separately from presentation. Architect your content structure, and write documents in Markdown and YAML.
- fully international: Internationalization features come built-in.
- flexible: The system is designed around launches. Launch on-demand, schedule launches, and have your whole team review them.
- security-minded: Run "pre-launch" checks against your sites that automatically detect commoon web security issues.
