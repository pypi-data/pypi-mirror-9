'''
Global grammars lie directly within the grammars directory.
App-specific grammars must be in subdirectories whose names
at least partially match the name of an open program. For example,
grammars in the directory 'mozilla firefox' will only run when a
program containing 'mozilla firefox' somewhere in its title is open and
has focus.
