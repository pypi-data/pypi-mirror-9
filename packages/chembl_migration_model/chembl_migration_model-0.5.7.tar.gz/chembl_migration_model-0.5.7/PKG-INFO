Description: chembl_migration_model
        ======
        
        This is chembl_migration_model package developed at Chembl group, EMBL-EBI, Cambridge, UK.
        
        This package contains Django ORM model suitable for data exports and migrations.
        It excludes some tables present in chembl_core_model (such as COMPOUND_MOLS and COMPOUND_IMAGES) as well as some columns in remaining tables.
        
        The model is generated dynamically from chembl_core_model and this is why models.py file is empty.
        Whole logic sits in __init__.py.
        All classes are unmanaged by default so you can't use them to syncdb.
        To create tables from the model you have to run migrate command from chembl_migrate.
