PDS Command Line Environment
----------------------------------------------

The ``pds`` command line environment provides commands for interacting with the You Technology
Personal Data Store.  The overall command structure is fairly simple, with command groups 
for each major resource in the PDS (types, scopes, etc...). All inputs and outputs are in 
the form of JSON documents.

Details on post-installation setup can be found in `PDS Command Line Tool Setup`_. 

The `PDS Command Line Tool Tutorial`_ shows basic usage of the tool.
