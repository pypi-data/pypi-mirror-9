This Python package provides command-line utilities to make it easier to run
machine learning experiments with scikit-learn.  One of the primary goals of
our project is to make it so that you can run scikit-learn experiments without
actually needing to write any code other than what you used to generate/extract
the features.

Command-line Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main utility we provide is called ``run_experiment`` and it can be used to
easily run a series of learners on datasets specified in a configuration file 
like:

.. code:: ini

  [General]
  experiment_name = Titanic_Evaluate_Tuned
  # valid tasks: cross_validate, evaluate, predict, train
  task = evaluate
  
  [Input]
  # these directories could also be absolute paths 
  # (and must be if you're not running things in local mode)
  train_directory = train
  test_directory = dev
  # Can specify multiple sets of feature files that are merged together automatically
  # (even across formats)
  featuresets = [["family.ndj", "misc.csv", "socioeconomic.arff", "vitals.csv"]]
  # List of scikit-learn learners to use
  learners = ["RandomForestClassifier", "DecisionTreeClassifier", "SVC", "MultinomialNB"]
  # Column in CSV containing labels to predict
  label_col = Survived
  # Column in CSV containing instance IDs (if any)
  id_col = PassengerId
  
  [Tuning]
  # Should we tune parameters of all learners by searching provided parameter grids?
  grid_search = true
  # Function to maximize when performing grid search
  objective = accuracy
  
  [Output]
  # again, these can/should be absolute paths
  log = output
  results = output
  predictions = output
  models = output


For more information about getting started with ``run_experiment``, please check
out `our tutorial <https://skll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html>`__, or
`our config file specs <https://skll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/run_experiment.html>`__.

We also provide utilities for:

-  `converting between machine learning toolkit formats <https://skll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/utilities.html#skll-convert>`__
   (e.g., ARFF, CSV, MegaM)
-  `filtering feature files <https://skll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/utilities.html#filter-features>`__
-  `joining feature files <https://skll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/utilities.html#join-features>`__
-  `other common tasks <https://skll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/utilities.html>`__


Python API
~~~~~~~~~~

If you just want to avoid writing a lot of boilerplate learning code, you can
also use our simple Python API. The main way you'll want to use the API is through
the ``Learner`` and ``Reader`` classes. For more details on our API, see
`the documentation <https://skll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html>`__.

While our API can be broadly useful, it should be noted that the command-line 
utilities are intended as the primary way of using SKLL.  The API is just a nice
side-effect of our developing the utilities.

SciKit-Learn Laboratory (SKLL) is pronounced "skull": that's where the learning
happens.
