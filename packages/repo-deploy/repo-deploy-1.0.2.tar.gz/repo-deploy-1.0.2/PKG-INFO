Description: 
        	Automates code and configuration deployment for continuous deployment environments by periodically
        	polling a source repository for configuration changes (http, git, s3, etc). When changes are
        	detected, the new files are retrieved and any locally configured update triggers are executed
        	(in /etc/repo-deploy/*.d). This is intentionally separate from configuration management systems
        	like Puppet in order to provide more flexible packaging and build process integration. The
        	deployer can be configured to run as a daemon (with supervisord) or under cron (or Puppet
        	agent.)
