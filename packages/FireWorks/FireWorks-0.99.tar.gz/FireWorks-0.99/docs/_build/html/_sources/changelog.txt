v0.7
----

.. caution:: The default behavior is now that mod_spec and update_spec push updates to next Firework AND the next FireTask
.. caution:: The FWConfig parameters are no longer called via a FWConfig() class instantiation; you can import these parameters directly now.

* Python 3 support! via 'six' library (S.P. Ong)

* Various internal improvements, e.g. to FWConfig (S.P. Ong)
* Bug fixes (A. Jain, S.P. Ong)

**v0.66**

.. warning:: This version changes the default serialization for custom FireWorks without _fw_name to <project>::<Class> instead of <Class>. If you have custom FireTasks from v0.62-v0.65 that did not specify _fw_name explicitly, this introduces a backward incompatibility. Contact the support list if this affects you - an easy fix is available.

* Fix major bug in dynamic workflows with multiple additions/detours
* Fixed lpad reset that became broken in recent release
* Change default _fw_name for FireTasks to <project>::<Class>, e.g. fireworks::MyTask

* Add qlaunch cleanup (S.P. Ong)
* Setup different default config dirs (S.P. Ong)

.. warning:: This version introduced a bug in ``lpad reset`` via the command line (fixed in v0.66)

.. caution:: The ``add_dir`` command is incorporated into the ``add`` command. e.g. ``lpad add my_dir/*.yaml``. Many command line options that allowed comma-separated lists are now space-separated lists to better employ argparse (see updated docs).

* clean up argument parsing (S.P. Ong)
* remote qlaunch handles multiple configs (S.P. Ong)


**v0.63**

* fix bug in rtransfer mode of FileTransferTask (S.P. Ong)
* improvements to remote qlaunch (S.P. Ong)

**v0.62**

.. caution:: The TransferTask is renamed to FileTransferTask (however, existing FireWorks databases should be backwards-compatibile). The names of the default FireTasks no longer have spaces; however, existing FireWorks databases and code should be backwards-compatible.

* Add FIFO and FILO sort options for equal priority FireWorks
* Remove database locks in multiprocessing mode
* Allow multiple scripts in ScriptTask (S.P. Ong)
* Add additional File I/O FireTasks (S.P. Ong)

**v0.61**

* Include text files needed for queue adapters in distribution (D. Gunter)

v0.6
----

.. caution:: The QueueAdapter code has been refactored in a way that is not fully backward compatible. Chances are, you will have to modify any ``my_qadapter.yaml`` files you have so that the ``_fw_name`` is set to *CommonAdapter* and a new ``_fw_q_type`` parameter is set to *PBS*, *SGE*, or *SLURM*.

v0.5
----

**v0.36**

.. caution:: The ``rerun_fw``, ``defuse_fw``, and ``reignite_fw`` commands are now pluralized, ``refresh_wf`` is simply ``refresh``, and ``rerun_fizzled`` has been incorporated into ``rerun_fws``.

* much more powerful control for ``rerun_fws``, ``defuse``, ``archive``, ``reignite``, ``defuse_fws``, ``reignite_fws``, ``refresh``.

**v0.35**

* restore behavior back to v0.33

**v0.34**
