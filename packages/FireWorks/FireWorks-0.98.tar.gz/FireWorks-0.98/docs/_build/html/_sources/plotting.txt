==================
Plotting workflows
==================

.. note:: You must have networkx and matplotlib installed as optional dependencies in order to use plotting

The plotting feature is in **alpha** stage of development. You can plot workflows via the command::

    lpad display_wflows -i <FW_ID>

where *<FW_ID>* corresponds to one of the Firework ids in your workflow.
