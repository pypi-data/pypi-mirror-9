-----

* Testing structure
* Some minor improvements in the core.

* The oficial package name now is seabird. I realized that my goal here goes beyond to just parse the .cnv files, so the name seabird covers it better.

* Bugfix, now handle well when timeJ has masked values.

* When position available in the header.intro as NMEA, load this instead of
    try to parse from the header.notes.
* Load default values from a yaml file, like attributes{cruise, project, 
    shipname ...}
