Description: cmd3 - A dynamic CMD shell with plugins
        =======================================
        
        cmd is an extension for the CMD class with the following features:
        
        * commands are loaded from plugin directories 
        * usage of docopts as part of the command creation
        * variable substitution
        * execution of python commands
        * scripts loadable from a script directory
        
        Through these extensions cmd becomes very flexible and can be used to
        extend command shell interface through simple add-ons via very simple
        plugins provided as classes.
