        Intro
        -----
        
        As we all know, we can use Amazon's free 3G network to deliver our docs,
        but we need to manually click the deliver buttom in the browser. This
        script is born to rescue us from this boring thing. Config this script,
        add it to the ``crontab`` and you'are done. All your docs will be sent
        to your kindle automatically.
        
        Requirement
        -----------
        
        -  Python 2.7
        -  Requests lib
        -  BeautifulSoup lib
        -  Linux platform(I haven't test it on windows)
        
        Install
        -------
        
        ::
        
            $ sudo pip install kindlepush
        
        Feature
        -------
        
        -  It has a log file, you can check which file you've delivered.
        
        -  Use sqlite database, don't worry about that a doc will be missed or
           delivered twice.
        
        -  Get pending deliveries.

                "directory": "/path/to/save/",  # save log file and database, end with '/'
                "count": 15,                    # check how many docs evert time that whether those have been deliverred before, default 15 is one page a time.
