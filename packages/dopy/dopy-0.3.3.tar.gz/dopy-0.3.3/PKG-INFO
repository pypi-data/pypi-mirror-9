Description: Digital Ocean API Python Wrapper
        ================================
        
        Inspired by [dop](https://github.com/ahmontero/dop).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code-block:: bash
            
            # pip install dopy
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        To interact with Digital Ocean, you first need .. a digital ocean account with 
        valid API keys.
        
        Keys can be set either as Env variables, or within the code.
        
        For API v.2.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            # export DO_API_VERSION='2'
            # export DO_API_TOKEN='api_token'
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
            >>> from dopy.manager import DoManager
            >>> do = DoManager(None, 'api_token', api_version=2)
        
        
        For API v.1.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
            
            # export DO_CLIENT_ID='client_id'
            # export DO_API_KEY='long_api_key'
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
            >>> from dopy.manager import DoManager
            >>> do = DoManager('client_id', 'long_api_key')
        
        Methods
        =======
        
        The methods of the DoManager are self explanatory; ex.
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
            >>> do.all_active_droplets()
            >>> do.show_droplet('12345')
            >>> do.destroy_droplet('12345')
            >>> do.all_regions()
            >>> do.all_images()
            >>> do.all_ssh_keys()
            >>> do.sizes()
            >>> do.all_domains()
            >>> do.new_droplet('new_droplet', 66, 1601, 1)
        
        The methods for v.2 API are similar, the only difference
        is using names instead of IDs for domains and slugs for
        sizes, images and datacenters; ex.
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
            >>> do.show_domain('exapmle.com')
            >>> do.new_droplet('new_droplet', '512mb', 'lamp', 'ams2')
