"""
Documentation can be found at https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/index.html, but usually you only need to do the
following steps to publish a new package version to PyPI::

    # Update the version tag in this file (setup.py)
    python setup.py register
    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip upload

That's already it. You should get the following output written to your command line::

    Server response (200): OK

If you get errors, check the following things:

- Are you behind a proxy? --> Try not to be behind a proxy (I don't actually know how to configure setup.py to be proxy-aware)
- Is your command correct? --> Double-check using the reference documentation
- Do you have all the necessary libraries to generate the wanted formats? --> Reduce the set of formats or install libs
