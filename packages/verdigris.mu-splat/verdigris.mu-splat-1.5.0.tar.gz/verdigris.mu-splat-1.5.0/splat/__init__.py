    """A general purpose signal.

    This class provides a thin Python wrapper around the signal functionality
    implemented in the C ``_splat`` extension.  It takes a signal and provides
    a sequence object which can be indexed and iterated.  Signals are limited
    in time and have a fixed duration.

    def __init__(self, frag, sig_obj, duration=None, origin=None):
        """The ``frag`` argument is a :py:class:`splat.data.Fragment` object
        with which the Signal will be compatible.  This is used to determine
        the sample rate and the duration of the signal.  Then ``sig_obj`` is
        the signal, which can be either a floating point value, a callable or a
        Fragment object.  The ``duration`` can be optionally used to provide an
        arbitrary Signal duration in seconds, different from the ``frag``
        duration which is used by default.

        When using a **callable** signal, it must accept a single floating
        point argument and return a floating point value.  As a minimal
        example, it may be a lambda function (that's a tremolo)::

          sig = splat.Signal(frag, lambda x: 0.8 + 0.2 * sin(x * 1000.0))

        The input value is often a time value, but it may be any dimension
        depending on the usage of the signal.  This is compatible with the
        :py:meth:`splat.interpol.Spline.value` method, so a Spline object can
        be used in conjunction with a Signal object.
