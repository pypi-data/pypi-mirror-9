0.4.3 (11-03-2015)
------------------

We had some packaging issues with the `0.4.2` release. 


0.4.2 (11-03-2015)
------------------

This release of Atramhasis is mostly a bugfix update of the `0.4.1` release. 

- Fix paths of db in scaffolds
- Add more information on exceptions 
- Update skosprovider_getty and skosprovider_heritagedata 
  (fix the problems when importing external thesauri)
- Documentation update


0.4.1 (04-03-2015)
------------------

This release of Atramhasis is a minor update of the `0.4.0` release, focussing
on small corrections and improvements and improving the documentation. A few
interesting non-invasive features were added, mostly to the editor's admin
interface and machine-readable exports of RDF data.

Upgrading from `0.4.0` should be simple and cause no or few problems.

- A conceptscheme, concept or collection can now be exported to RDF through
  skosprovider_rdf_ 0.3.1. These are individuals export endpoints that can
  be reached in one of two ways. Either by hitting a url like
  http://localhost:6543/conceptschemes/GEOGRAPHY/c/335 with a supported RDF mimetype
  (``application/rdf+xml``, ``application/x-turtle``, ``text-turle``). Or by
  using an RDF syntax specific suffix (.rdf or .ttl).
- When importing, allow the user to request more information on a concept or
  collection, before actually importing it.
- Allow merging a concept with other concepts it matches. This allows a user to
  compare a local concept with an external one it matches and import any notes
  or labels that are present in the external concept, but not the local one.
- Reworked some parts of the public interface to make everything a bit clearer
  and to make all pages easily reachable.
- Allow sorting the languages in the admin interface.
- Reorganised and extended the right click menu on the grid in the admin
  interface.
- Allow looking up a *skos:match* from within the admin interface.
- Some issues with the length of language ids were solved.
- Fixed some issues when importing a collection instead of a concept.
- Made it easy to add a Google Analytics tracker.
- Added instructions on how to deploy a demo site on heroku_. These work just as
  well for deploying an actual production site to heroku_.
- Lots of small updates and tweaks to the documentation.
- Updated some dependencies.
- Some code cleanup and reorganisation. Several smaller bugs in the admin
  interface were fixed.
- The data fixtures were updated with *skos:note* examples. Added a license for
  reuse of the fixture data.

0.4.0 (23-12-2014)
------------------

- Update to skosprovider_ 0.5.0. Among other things, this makes it possible
  to handle relations between Concepts and Collections using the 
  *subordinate_arrays* and *superordinates* properties. Conceptschemes are
  now also much better integrated within the providers, thus making it 
  possible to provider more context for a Concept. This version of 
  skosprovider_ can also handle *skos:matches*.
- Add possibility to edit language tags. It's now possible to use the admin
  interface to add, edit and delete languages in Atramhasis. 
- When the REST service receives labels or notes in currently unavailable 
  languages, it will validate those through language_tags_. It the languages 
  are valid according to the IANA registry, they will be added to the languages 
  available in the application.
- Default length of language id changed to 64 characters. This is not available
  as an alembic migration. So only effective when creating a new database.
  If you already have a database created from an older version of Atramhasis,
  please modify accordingly. Modifying column length on SQLite is not possible
  (see http://www.sqlite.org/omitted.html ).
- Abiltity to match Concepts in an Atramhasis ConceptScheme to Concepts in 
  external ConceptSchemes through properties such as *skos:exactMatch* and
  *skos:closeMatch*.
- Ability to import Concepts and Collections from external providers. This 
  makes it possible to import Concepts from eg. the AAT (via skosprovider_getty_),
  Flanders Heritage Thesauri (via skosprovider_oe_),
  English Heritage Thesauri (via skosprovider_heritagedata_) or any other 
  SKOS vocabulary for which a skosprovider_ has been written. Currently only 
  the concept or collection itself can be imported, without its relations to 
  other concepts or collections.
- Add the ability to have a delete of a concept or collection fail if it is 
  being used in other systems.
- Implement a delete permission.
- Add validation rule that a Concept must have at least one label.
- Update to skosprovider_sqlalchemy_ 0.4.1.
- Update to pyramid_skosprovider_ 0.5.0.
- Update to skosprovider_rdf_ 0.3.0. This update adds support for dumping 
  ConceptScheme in an RDF file and also handles *subordinate_arrays* and
  *superordinates*.
- Update to language_tags_ 0.3.0.


0.3.1 (05-09-2014)
------------------

- Update to skosprovider_sqlalchemy_ 0.2.1.
- Update to skosprovider_rdf_ 0.1.3 This fixes an issue with RDF having some
  SKOS elements in the wrong namespace. Also added a missing dependency on
  skosprovider_rdf_ to setup.py
- Updated the Travis build file to run a basic dojo build and test for build
  failures.


0.3.0 (15-08-2014)
------------------

- Atramhasis now includes a working admin userinterface at `/admin`. Still needs
  some polish when it comes to error handling and reporting about validation 
  errors.
- The admin module gets run through a dojo build to minimize page loads
  and download times
- Added RDF/XML en RDF/Turtle downloads to the public interface. Currently
  only dumps a full conceptscheme, not individual concepts.
- Added more docs.
  

0.2.0 (16-05-2014)
------------------

- Full public userinterface
- REST CRUD service
- Security integration
- CSV export
- demo using Mozilla Persona as sample security setup


0.1.0 (22-04-2014)
------------------

- Initial version
- Setup of the project: docs, unit testing, code coverage
- Scaffolding for demo and deployment packages
- Limited public user interface
- Basis i18n abilities present
- Integration of pyramid_skosprovider_
- Integration of skosprovider_
- Integration of skosprovider_sqlalchemy_
