The PDF generation is based on the Produce & Publisher framework
(https://www.produce-and-publish.com) - in particular on the Produce & Publish
Server and its counter part Produce & Publish Client. The PDF conversion is
accomplished using an external like PrinceXML (http://www.princexml.com) or
PDFreactor (https://www.pdfreactor.com). One of the converters must be licensed
for production usage. Our preference and recommendation is PDFreactor.
