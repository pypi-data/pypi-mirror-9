django-autoconfig
=================

Automatic configuration of a Django project based on the requirements of apps in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

Basic Usage
-----------

Import ``django_autoconfig.autoconfig`` in ``settings.py``, and call ``configure_settings`` with ``globals()``::

    from django_autoconfig.autoconfig import configure_settings
    configure_settings(globals())

``django-autoconfig`` will run through each app in ``INSTALLED_APPS``, applying the configuration in their ``autoconfig`` module.

.. note::
    ``configure_settings`` must be run after ``INSTALLED_APPS`` is defined.

In your app, define a ``autoconfig`` module, that contains the settings you need defined, or the app's requirements::

    SETTINGS = {
        'MY_APP_MUST_HAVE_THIS_VARIABLE_SET': False,
    }

Ordering Relationships
----------------------

If your app requires a particular ordering of the values in a setting, you can define a list of ``django_autoconfig.autoconfig.OrderingRelationship`` objects specifying these relationships.

.. autoclass:: django_autoconfig.autoconfig.OrderingRelationship
    :show-inheritance:
    :members:

Autoconfig Rules
----------------

1. If a setting does not exist, it will be defined.
2. If a setting exists and is a ``list`` or ``tuple``, the contents will be appended to the existing setting, ignoring any duplicates.
3. If a setting exists and is a ``dict``, the keys will be merged, and values merged, according to these same rules.
4. If an app is in ``AUTOCONFIG_DISABLED_APPS``, that app won't have its autoconfig processed.

Inconsistent States
-------------------

If autoconfig cannot reach a consistent state, an ``ImproperlyConfigured`` exception will be raised. This means that two or more apps could not agree on the required settings, and this must be manually reserved.
