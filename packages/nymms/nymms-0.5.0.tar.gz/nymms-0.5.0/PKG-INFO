Description: ===========================================
        NYMMS (Not Your Mother's Monitoring System)
        ===========================================
        
        You can find the latest docs (there aren't enough!) at ReadTheDocs_.
        
        NYMMS is a monitoring framework that takes inspiration from a lot of different
        places.
        
        It's goals are:
        
        - Independently scalable components
        - Fault tolerant
        - Easily useable in a cloud environment
        - Easy to add new monitors
        
        There are many other goals, but that's a good start.
        
        Here's a somewhat hard to understand diagram (at least without some
        explanation):

        Requirements
        ============
        
        Currently the main requirements are:
        
        - Python (2.7 - may work on older versions, haven't tested)
        - boto
        - PyYAML (used in a few backends, will eventually not be a requirement unless
          you need to use those backends)
        - Jinja2 (needed for templating)
        - Validictory (0.9.1 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/validictory/0.9.1)
        
        Optionally:
        
        - pagerduty (0.2.1 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pagerduty/0.2.1) if you use the
          pagerduty reactor handler
