        Perform an administrative HTTP request. This request is sent out to
        the administrative API interface (i.e. the "Management/REST API")
        of the cluster.

        See <LINK?> for a list of available comments.

        Note that this is a fairly low level function. This class will with
        time contain more and more wrapper methods for common tasks such
        as bucket creation or node allocation, and this method should
        mostly be used if a wrapper is not available.

        :param string path: The path portion (not including the host) of the
          rest call to perform. This should also include any encoded arguments.

        :param string method: This is the HTTP method to perform. Currently
          supported values are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`

        :param bytes content: Content to be passed along in the request body.
          This is only applicable on `PUT` and `POST` methods.

        :param string content_type: Value for the HTTP ``Content-Type`` header.
          Currently this is ``application-json``, and should probably not be
          set to something else.

        :param int response_format:
          Hint about how to format the response. This goes into the
          :attr:`~couchbase.result.HttpResult.value` field of the
