        Bookmarklet
        -----------
        
        jaraco.pmxbot provides a bookmarklet
        for readily sending messages to the pmxbot HTTP interface. To install it,
        just open /bookmarklet in the API service. It will present a link.
        Option-click the link and add it to your bookmarks. Give it a name like
        "Send to pmxbot".
        
        To use the bookmarklet, browse to any web page, then select the bookmarklet.
        You will be prompted with a dialog with a channel and message. Specify the
        channel and optionally edit the message. Then hit Enter or click Submit and
        that message will be broadcast on the channel indicated.
        
        
        3.0
        ===
        
        Kiln and BitBucket now also use the ChannelSelector. Therefore, clients
        should be updated not to pass the channel, and instead just specify the
        endpoint (i.e. http://my.pmxbot/kiln or /bitbucket). Furthermore, the channel
        routing should be specified in the config based on the repository name.
        
        2.0
        ===
        
        FogBugz config key should now be "FogBugz channels".
        
        Jenkins HTTP endpoint now uses config to route messages to channels rather
        than requiring it in the URL. The new endpoint is simply "/jenkins".
