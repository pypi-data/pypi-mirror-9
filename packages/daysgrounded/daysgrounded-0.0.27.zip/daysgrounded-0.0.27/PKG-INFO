Description: daysgrounded
        ============
        
        *daysgrounded* allows you to manage your kid's grounded days (simple app for trying Python programming and testing procedures).
        
        Although the code is OS independent, I'm only able to test it in console (Windows Cmd) and Windows GUI.
        
        You shouldn't use this because it's just a fake app for allowing me to try Python programming and testing procedures.
        
        **Features:**
        
        * Saves a log file with all changes.
        * Saves grounded days total per child and last update date.
        * Allows changes in CLI and GUI (this last one has different widgets for the same function).
