IoT library is an API interface to communicate with an ISOTEL of Things (IoT) server.
An IoT server provides innovative ways to interact with hardware devices like sensors, actuators connected via serial links, USB, bluetooth, wireless, etc., in a distributed, profile-less manner, to support heterogeneity and scalability.
isotel-iot API can bind to an IoT server, search for available devices, as well as interact with them by retrieving and modifying their values.
IoT servers can connect to each others via Skype, a feature extremely useful to reach out to remote devices behind firewalls.
