# Murano Classes Metadata

This folder contains only 'core library' classes for Murano.

Any file located here will be included into Murano package (deb/rpm) and imported automatically during installation.

Any other classes should be imported manually via CLI or UI.

Such classes could be found in one of two external repositories:
* Murano App Incubator repository - https://github.com/murano-project/murano-app-incubator
* Murano Incubated Apps repository - doesn't exist yet
