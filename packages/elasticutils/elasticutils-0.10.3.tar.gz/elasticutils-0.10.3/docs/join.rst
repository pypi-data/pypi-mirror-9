Interested in working on a Python library for using elasticsearch?
Interested in using it? Then you should be interested in this project!


Want to help?
=============

Here are things we need help with:

* **fixing bugs listed in the issue tracker**

* **writing tests**

* **writing documentation**: We could use help writing better
  documentation for ElasticUtils.

* **spreading the word**: Do you know other people who would like this
  software? If so, tell them about ElasticUtils!

* **project infrastructure**: Is there infrastructure that's missing
  in this project that would make it easier for you to collaborate? If
  so, what?


Are you thinking, "That list is makes me want to go shopping for bumper
stickers!" That's ok!  Hop on IRC, say hi and we can go from there!
