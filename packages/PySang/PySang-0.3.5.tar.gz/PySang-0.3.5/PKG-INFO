        ## Requirements
        - [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/)
        - [biopython](http://www.biopython.org)

        you can do without it.
        
        ## Usage
        Install and call pysang. An example sequence is opened. Press Ctrl+O or use
        the mouse to open your Sanger sequence.
