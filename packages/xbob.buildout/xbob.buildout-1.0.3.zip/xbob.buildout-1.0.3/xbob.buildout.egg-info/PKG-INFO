         Buildout Recipes for Bob Packages
        ===================================
        
        This package contains a number of recipes to be used to build `Satellite
        Packages <http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob/docs/releases/last/sphinx/html/OrganizeYourCode.html>`_ for `Bob <http://idiap.github.com/bob/>`_,
        a signal-processing and machine learning toolbox originally developed by the
        Biometrics Group at Idiap, in Switzerland.
        
        .. note::
        
          You normally don't need to download this package directly. It will be done by
          ``zc.buildout`` automatically, if you followed our recipe to build `Satellite
          Packages`_.
        
        C++/Python Extension
        --------------------
        
        This extension allows you to compile C/C++ extensions that depend on each other
        using a buildout. It assures that eggs living in both ``develop-eggs`` and
        ``eggs`` are on your path before building the packages in the ``develop``
        section. By using this extension you can drop the use of the local recipe
        ``xbob.buildout:develop``, which should be considered deprecated.
        
        Supported Options
        =================
        
        verbose
        
          If set, buildout it will output the compilation commands while compiling the
          module.
        
        prefixes
        
          A list of directories where this recipe will look for installed software,
          such as compiled libraries and header files. It is the same as setting the
          environment variable ``BOB_PREFIX_PATH`` to a list of paths containing
          externally installed software. As a side-effect, setting ``BOB_PREFIX_PATH``
          also sets, internally, ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` to a list of directories following
          where to search for pkg-config files.
        
        debug
        
          If set, the module will be compiled with debugging symbols and with
          optimization turned off. If ``debug`` is set to ``true``, this is equivalent
          to appending the environment variables ``CFLAGS`` and ``CXXFLAGS`` with ``-O0
          -g``. If it is set to ``false``, it is the same as appending ``-O3 -g0``
          instead.
        
        environ
        
          The name of a section on your configuration file that contains the names and
          values of environment variables that should be used through the build. This
          section is named, by default, ``environ``.
        
          If a section named ``environ`` exists, it is read and the environment
          variables are set **before** the specified eggs are developed. You can use
          variable substitution on this section. Here is an an example::
        
            [environ]
            CFLAGS = '-O0 -g -DNDEBUG'
            CXXFLAGS = ${CFLAGS}
        
          Notice there is some functionality overlap between the previous flags and the
          use of section ``environ``. While it is more flexible, you must understand
          the consequences of setting both ``prefixes`` and ``debug``, together with
          ``environ``. The rule is simple: values set on the ``environ`` section have
          **precedence** to ``debug`` and ``prefixes``. If you set ``debug`` and
          ``CFLAGS`` (or ``CXXFLAGS``) in the ``environ`` section, for example, then
          the values on the final ``CFLAGS`` variable would be ``-O0 -g`` followed by
          ``environ``'s ``CFLAGS`` settings. Analogously, the paths defined by
          ``environ``'s ``BOB_PREFIX_PATH`` and ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` are **prepended**
          to those listed in ``prefixes``, if that is also set.
        
        Multi-Script Installer
        ----------------------
        
        This recipe installs **all** most used scripts and interpreter proxies for your
        package. It will look at the ``buildout`` section entry called ``prefixes``,
        that potentially lists prefixes that should be **prepended** to the default
        python environment. In these prefixes, it will look for standard python
        directories. If one or more are found, these paths are **prepended** into
        the resulting scripts generated by this recipe and eggs will be searched on
        those locations prioritarily.
        
        By default, this recipe will use the eggs defined at the ``buildout`` section
        called ``eggs``, but that can be overriden locally. It generates these scripts:
        
        python
          A pre-configured python interpreter
        
        gdb-python
          A pre-configured python interpreter, prefixed with ``gdb`` to make debugging
          easier. Use it like you use ``python``.
        
        nosetests
          A test runner called ``nosetests`` will be created on the bin directory of
          buildout.
        
        coverage
          A test coverage application called ``coverage`` will be created on the bin
          directory of buildout.
        
        sphinx
          Several sphinx utilities will be created on the bin directory of buildout.
        
        package scripts
          Package scripts will be created taking into account the ``prefixes``
          established for this section or globally (as a second priority).
        
        To use this recipe, you just have to simply do::
        
          [scripts]
          recipe = xbob.buildout:scripts
        
        Common Supported Options
        ========================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        prefixes
          A list of directories where this recipe will look for subdirectories with
          the stem ``lib/python*/site-packages``. All directories matching this
          condition are appended to the search paths. If not given, the value of this
          property defaults to ``buildout.prefixes``. Both can be empty, which makes
          this recipe default to using standard available paths.
        
        eggs
          The eggs option specifies a list of eggs to use for **building** this
          package. Each string must be given on a separate line. If not given, the
          value of this property defaults to ``buildout.eggs``.
        
        dependent-scripts
          If set to the string ``true``, scripts will be generated for all required
          eggs in addition to the eggs specifically named.
        
        interpreter
          The name of a script to generate that allows access to a Python interpreter
          that has the path set based on the eggs installed. If you don't specify
          anything, the default value ``python`` will be used.
        
        extra-paths
          Extra paths to be appended in a generated script. To prepend, using the
          ``prefixes`` entry.
        
        nose-flags
          These are extra flags that are **appended** to the given ``nosetests``
          command line, automatically. Use this to preset arguments you like running
          all the time like ``-v``, for example.
        
        Other Recipes
        -------------
        
        This package also provides recipes that allow for the discrete installation of
        interpreters and support programs, lumped together with the ``scripts`` recipe
        described above. You can use some of the options described above with these
        recipes. For example, the ``prefixes``, ``eggs`` and ``extra-paths`` are
        considered by all these recipes.
        
        .. note::
        
          Use of these individual recipes should be done with care. The ``scripts``
          recipe should be used by default, unless you have a special requirement that
          is not covered by that recipe.
        
        python
          This recipe generates **just** a python interpreter on the binary directory.
          Extra options considered: ``interpreter``.
        
        ipython
          This recipe generates an IPython interpreter on the binary directory.
          Extra options considered: ``interpreter``.
        
        gdb-python
          This recipe generates a gdb launcher using the python interpreter so you can
          start your scripts directly typing ``gdb-python myscript.py``.
        
        pylint
          No extra options for this recipe.
        
        nose
          This recipe generates only the ``nosetests`` program. Extra options
          considered are:``nose-flags``.
        
        coverage
          This recipe generates only the ``coverage`` program. Extra options
          considered are:``coverage-flags``.
        
        sphinx
          This recipe generates only the Sphinx documentation generator applications.
          Extra options considered: none.
        
        egg.scripts
          This recipe generates only the scripts (and dependent scripts) for the
          package. Extra options considered: ``dependent-scripts``.
