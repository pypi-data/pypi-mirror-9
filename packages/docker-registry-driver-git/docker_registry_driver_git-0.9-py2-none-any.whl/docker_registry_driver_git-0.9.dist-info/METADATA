Description: # Docker registry git driver
        
        This is a [docker-registry backend driver][registry-core] which stores images 
        in a git repository.
        
        [![PyPI version][pypi-image]][pypi-url]
        ## Usage
        
        
        
        ```
        pip install docker-registry-driver-git
        ```
        
        Then edit your docker-registry configuration so that `storage` reads `gitdriver`.
        
        
        ## Options
        
        You may add any of the following to your main docker-registry configuration to further configure it:
        
        ```yaml
        storage: gitdriver
        storage_path: /gitrepopath
        
        ```
