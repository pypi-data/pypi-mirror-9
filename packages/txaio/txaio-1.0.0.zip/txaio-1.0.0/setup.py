``txaio`` is a helper library for writing code that runs unmodified on
both Twisted and asyncio.

This is like `six <http://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_, but for wrapping
over differences between Twisted and asyncio so one can write code
that runs unmodified on both (*aka* "source code compatibility"). In
other words: your users can choose if they want asyncio **or** Twisted
as a dependency.

    Note that, with this approach, user code runs under the native
    event loop of either Twisted or asyncio. This is different from
    attaching either one's event loop to the other using some event
    loop adapter.
