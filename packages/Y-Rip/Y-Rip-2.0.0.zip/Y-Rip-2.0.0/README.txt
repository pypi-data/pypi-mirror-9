## INSTALL

1 )>  Use Command Prompt or CMD or some Powered software, Path it to here.
2 )>  Make sure you have Python Installed.
3 )>  Use the following Command to install Yrip.

        ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
       	`														   `
       	`   python setup.py install                                `
       	`                                                          `

4 )> See the Sample files to get an idea of how this Works!       	



## CHANGES:
Added another function, so theres now 2 RIP Hashing algorithm
Renamed Yrip algorithm to Trimlet

Added Aripple Function that generates Bytes of Hashes. And If Cracked only returns ` abcdef/0123456789 ` So password cannot be cracked!
