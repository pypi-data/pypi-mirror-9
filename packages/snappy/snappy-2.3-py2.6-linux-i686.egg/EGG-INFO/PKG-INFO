Description: SnapPy is a package for studying the topology and geometry of
        3-manifolds, with a focus on hyperbolic structures.  It is based on
        the SnapPea kernel written by `Jeffery Weeks
        <http://www.geometrygames.org>`_.  
        
        Complete documentation is available on the web including the
        `main page <http://snappy.computop.org>`_ and an
        `installation guide <http://snappy.computop.org/installing.html>`_.
