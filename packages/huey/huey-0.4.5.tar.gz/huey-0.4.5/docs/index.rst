=========================

.. image:: http://media.charlesleifer.com/blog/photos/huey-logo.png

a lightweight alternative.

* written in python
* no deps outside stdlib, except redis (or roll your own backend)
* support for django

supports:

* multi-threaded task execution
* scheduled execution at a given time
* periodic execution, like a crontab
* retrying tasks that fail
* task result storage


Huey's API
----------

.. code-block:: python

    from huey import RedisHuey, crontab

    huey = RedisHuey('my-app', host='redis.myapp.com')

    @huey.task()
    def add_numbers(a, b):
        return a + b

    @huey.periodic_task(crontab(minute='0', hour='3'))
    def nightly_backup():
        sync_all_data()
