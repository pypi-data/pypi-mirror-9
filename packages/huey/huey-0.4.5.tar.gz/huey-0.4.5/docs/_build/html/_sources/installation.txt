Installing
==========

huey can be installed very easily using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install huey

huey has no dependencies outside the standard library, but currently the only
fully-implemented queue backend it ships with requires `redis <http://redis.io>`_.
To use the redis backend, you will need to install the python client.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install redis
