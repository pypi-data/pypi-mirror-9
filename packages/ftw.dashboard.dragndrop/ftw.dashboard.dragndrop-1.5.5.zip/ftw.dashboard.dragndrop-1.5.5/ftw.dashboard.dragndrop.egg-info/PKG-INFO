        Install
        =======
        
        - Add ``ftw.dashboard.dragndrop`` to your buildout configuration:
        
        ::
        
          [instance]
          eggs =
            ftw.dashboard.dragndrop
        
        - Run buildout.
        
        - Install ``ftw.dashboard.dragndrop`` in portal_setup.
        
        - Configure the dashboard in the ``portal_properties`` tool (addablePortlets).
        
        
        Properties:
        ===========
        
        - **dashboardEditable**:
          True: The dashboard will always be editable, all functionalities are available
          False: The standard view (``@@dashboard``) will only provide the dragndrop and the fold functionality. Use the ``@@manage-dashbord`` view to customize your dashboard.
        
        - **columnNumber**:
          Number of dashboard columns. There are only 4 portlet managers provided by plone. If you need more you need to register additional dashboard portlet managers.
        
        - **addablePortlets**:
          Defines the addable portlets.
          You can use "portlet.Calendar" or "portlet.Calendar:Portlet Calendar". With the latter form you can change the title of the portlet.
          You ca also use "@@my-view:My custom view, which adds a portlet". If the first parts starts with "@@", the given view will be called.
        
        - **showleftcolumn**:
          Displays the plone.leftcolumn
        
        - **showrightcolumn**:
