About
=====

comt is an open source web application for annotating, discussing
and writing texts online.

It's the software that powers the `co-ment web service
<http://www.co-ment.com>`_.


Annotate, discuss, (re)write…
-----------------------------

… are the three main functions of comt. They open many possible
uses: school, corporate, legal, advocacy… View our use cases.



Import cares for compatibility
------------------------------

The import module of comt is compatible with many document formats
to let you import your existing texts into the site.


Text editor inside
------------------

You can create new texts or edit your previously uploaded ones
through the text editor integrated into comt. To organize your
text, choose between 3 languages: the extended pandoc flavor of
markdown (recommended), HTML or RST.

Export to good-looking printable formats
----------------------------------------

Simplified formatting of text in comt allows a high quality export.

Several formats are available for export: PDF, Open Office, MS Word,
LaTex and HTML.


A text’s life
-------------

You can edit your text, taking in account modification proposals
from commentators for example. comt allows version management.
You can switch back to a previous version any time and visualize
changes between any two versions. When you create a new one, you
can keep the received comments or discard them.

Contributor and role management
-------------------------------

Create a working group easily around a text or a set of texts.
Invite your contributors on the fly and give them a common role or
give some of them a specific role: observer, commentator, moderator,
editor or manager.

RSS feed, e-mail: choose your alert tool
----------------------------------------

To be alerted of new contributions to a text (new comment, new
version), a RSS feed and an e-mail alert system are provided for
each text.


The workspace
-------------

comt’s workspace gives you a global view of your group’s activity
(comments, new subscribers, new texts…) and a direct access to the
contents.

You have a real-time view of your working group members, texts and
comments through the dashboard portlets. A precious tool for managing
a project in a paperless environment.


Activity-meter
--------------

You can view your group’s activity at different levels (global, for
a specific text or member). You can adjust the graph’s time-frame:
day, week or month.

Browse through comments easily
------------------------------

What if your text receives a lot of comments? You can display or
browse them according to the part of the text commented, their date
of arrival, their author or their tags.
