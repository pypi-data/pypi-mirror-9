HotLine
=======
A pop-up input field with customizable settings. Supporting multiple modes, syntax highlighting, and inline autocompletion.

HotLine is like a supped up version of Nuke's node creator. Best of all, it works *anywhere* through the use of context modules. These modules make use of the HotLine api to add Modes and parent HotLine to an existing PySide application. Currently HotLine only comes with a Context for Autodesk Maya.
