Installation
=============

Installing htmlPy
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    The following instructions will install htmlPy module. The module is dependent on PyQt4 which can not be installed using setuptools. Please refer the further instructions for PyQt4 installation instructions.


You can install htmlPy with :command:`pip`::

    $ pip install Pillow

Or :command:`easy_install` (for installing `Python Eggs <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs>`_, as :command:`pip` does not support them)::

    $ easy_install htmlPy

Or download the `compressed archive from PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/htmlPy/>`_, extract it, and inside it, run::

    $ python setup.py install

.. note::
    Superuser access may be required if you are trying to install htmlPy globally. Please use **sudo** before the above commands in such case. However, installation inside **virtualenv** is highly recommended.

Installing PyQt4_
~~~~~~~~~~

htmlPy is dependent on PyQt4_ which cannot be installed using :command:`pip` or :command:`easy_install`. It has to be installed manually. Please see :doc:`PyQt4 installation instruction <pyqt_installation>` for instructions for installation of PyQt4 globally and inside virtualenv.
