    """Find the peaks or valleys of a 1D signal.

    Uses the difference (np.diff) in signal to find peaks. Current limitations include:
        1) Only for use in 1-D data; 2D may be possible with the gradient function.
        2) Will not detect peaks at the very edge of array (i.e. 0 or -1 index)

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : array-like
        1D y-data of signal.
    x : array-like
        1D x-data of signal. If None, will create a uniform range the length of the y-data.
    threshold : int, float
        The value the peak must be above to be considered a peak. This removes "peaks"
        that are in a low-value region.
        If passed an int, the actual value is the threshold.
        E.g. when passed 15, any peak less with a value <15 is removed.
        If passed a float, it will threshold as a percent. Must be between 0 and 1.
        E.g. when passed 0.4, any peak <40% of the maximum value will be removed.
    min_peak_width : int, float
        If passed an int, parameter is the number of elements apart a peak must be from neighboring peaks.
        If passed a float, must be between 0 and 1 and represents the ratio of the profile to exclude.
        E.g. if passed 0.05 with a 1000-element profile, the minimum peak width will be 0.05*1000 = 50 elements.
    max_num_peaks : int
        Specify up to how many peaks will be returned. E.g. if 3 is passed in and 5 peaks are found, only the 3 largest
        peaks will be returned.
    find_min_instead : bool
        If False (default), peaks will be returned.
        If True, valleys will be returned.

    Returns
    -------
    max_vals : numpy.array
        The values of the peaks found.
    max_idxs : numpy.array
        The x-indices (locations) of the peaks.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If float not between 0 and 1 passed to threshold.
