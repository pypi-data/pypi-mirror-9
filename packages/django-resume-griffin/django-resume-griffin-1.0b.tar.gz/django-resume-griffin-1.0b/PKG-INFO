Description: =======================
        Django |Resume| Griffin
        =======================
        
        Purpose
        =======
        
        So, you're wanting to put up a |resume| on your site (being an excellent
        Django developer and all, why not?). You grab your good ol' PDF you've used
        since 2007 and copy and paste your |resume| in the WYSIWYG editor in Django.
        It may look pretty; you may have to mess with it a little bit.
        
        Yeah, you could do it that way. Or you could do it **the Griffin Way!**
        
        Django |Resume| Griffin takes your |resume| to the next level by modelling it.
        You can keep track of where you worked, for how long, and who your managers
        were.
        
        What's With the Name?
        ---------------------
        
        A lot of open source projects use a gimmick to name projects or versions. The
        naming scheme for my projects is mythical creatures. This one is--obviously--a
        griffin. My other projects include `Token Asena
        <https://www.pypy.org/griffin-token-asena>`_ and `Project Goblin
        <https://www.pypi.org/django-project-goblin>`_.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        As with most django apps, the easiest way way is PIP::
        
            pip install -U django-resume-griffin
        
        Now add ``griffin`` to the list of installed apps::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                # ...
                'griffin',
                # ...
            )
        
        
        .. |Resume| replace:: Résumé
        .. |resume| replace:: résumé
