"""
This middleware manages the "editing" status of a Session. 

Views should not pay attention (nor modify) the "editing" key in request.GET and in request.session.
Views are supposed to call is_editing() to determine whether they should
render an editable version or not.

Internally, editing is activated by a GET editing=1, 
stopped explicitly by GET editing=0, or stopped automatically 
if the request.path changes. Editing is also "sticky", if theres no
"editing" key requested, then the previous request's value is 
maintained.


There can be more than one renderers in a single request. 
When a renderer says stop_editing(), then this should become 
active only for the next request, other renderers of the same 
request must still get True when they call is_editing().

If a renderer calls stop_editing() and some other renderer 
(before or after) calls continue_editing(), then editing continues.

Example: when a renderer saves successfully, then it calls stop_editing(). But if some other renderer detects a validation error, then it calls continue_editing() and this will override the stop call of the first renderer.
