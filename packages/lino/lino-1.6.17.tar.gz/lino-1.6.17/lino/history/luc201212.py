  Continued on module :mod:`lino.modlib.codechanges`.
  I abandoned a first approach which used a `changes.py` 
  file in each module because
  code changes must be documented in *one central place 
  per developer*, not per module.

  The next approach is using a package :mod:`lino.history`.
  This package is importable Python code where the developer 
  writes down what he does. The first example is 
  :srcref:`/lino/lino/history/luc201212.py`, 
  which contains a report, in Python syntax, 
  about my work in December 2012 (since yesterday).

  A first version just stored these objects in memory 
  and used the existing CodeChanges table.

  While working on this I understand that this system can also 
  be just an intermediate solution on our way to do all this 
  directly in :mod:`lino.projects.presto`.

  So the virtual table CodeChanges goes away, 
  and a fixture :mod:`lino.projects.presto.fixtures.history`
  imports the :mod:`lino.history` package and yields 
  them to the deserializer.

    blogger.entry(CMS, 2304, "Started template inheritance", """
  The sidebar doesn't yet work. 

  The best way to solve this is probably using template inheritance.

  So in a first step I started to use it,
  as described in http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/api/#loaders,
  by defining 
  an `Environment` instance and my own loader 
  (in :mod:`lino.core.web`).

  I also replaced Django's template engine by Jinja,
  as explained in 
  `Using an alternative template language
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/api/#using-an-alternative-template-language>`_.
  Lino used Django's template engine only for the mandatory 
  `500.html` and `404.html` templates.

  All this is really great! 
  I had never used templates because Django's 
  engine doesn't allow function calls. 
  In the beginning when I discovered Django, 
  I felt clearly that this isn't my thing.
  Cheetah had this feature, and I need it to generate `linolib.js`, 
  but I never really fell in love with Cheetah.
  I plan to replace this one also by Jinja soon.
  I did hear about Jinja, too,
  but I just didn't recognize that this was the door to a great new world.
