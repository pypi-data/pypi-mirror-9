Installation

Pre-requisites
--------------

If you are planning to use ``cASO`` for generating accounting records for EGI,
you will need a valid APEL/SSM configuration. Follow the documentation
available at the `EGI FedCloud wiki
<https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Fedcloud-tf:WorkGroups:Scenario4#Publishing_Records>`_

Installation
------------

At the command line::

    $ pip install caso

Or, if you have virtualenvwrapper installed::

    $ mkvirtualenv caso
    $ pip install caso

CentOS 6
********
    
On CentOS 6, you can use Software Collections to install Python 2.7::
    
    $ yum -y install centos-release-SCL
    $ yum -y install python27

There are also some dependencies of the packages used by ``cASO`` that need to
be installed (gcc, libffi-devel adn openssl-devel)::

    $ yum -y install gcc libffi-devel openssl-devel
    
You can then install pip for that version of Python and use that to install
``cASO``::

    $ scl enable python27 bash
    $ easy_install-2.7 pip
    $ pip install caso
    $ exit    # this terminates bash with the SCL python2.7

In this case you can later on use ``caso-extract`` with the following command
line::

    $ scl enable python27 caso-extract

Alternatively, if you want to use a virtualenv::

    $ scl enable python27 bash
    $ virtualenv caso
    $ . caso/bin/activate
    $ pip install caso
    $ exit    # this terminates bash with the SCL python2.7

Running from the virtualenv::

    $ scl enable python27 caso/bin/caso-extract
