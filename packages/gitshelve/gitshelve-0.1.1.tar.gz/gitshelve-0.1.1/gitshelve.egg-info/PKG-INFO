        gitshelve is very useful standalone code inside of the git-issues.  This
        repo is to separate it out into its own project.  That being the case,
        the following changes were made:
        
        1. original history has been retained [by using git filter-branch and
        a simple command
        line](http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/Remove-all-files-except-a-few-files-using-filter-branch-td7567155.html).
        2. code has been updated to support python 2 and 3 (2.7 and 3.2 tested)
        3. unit tests have been written to cover 93% of the code.
