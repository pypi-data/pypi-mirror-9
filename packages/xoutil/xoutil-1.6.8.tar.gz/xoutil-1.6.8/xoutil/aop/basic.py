'''
Very simple AOP implementation allowing method replacing in objects with
change function, reset an object to its original state and user a special
super function inner new functions used to inject the new behavior.

Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) increase modularity by allowing the
separation of cross-cutting concerns.

An aspect can alter the behavior of the base code (the non-aspect part of a
program) by applying advice (additional behavior) at various join-points
(points in a program) specified in a quantification or query called a point-
cut (that detects whether a given join point matches).

An aspect can also make structural changes to other classes, like adding
members or parents.

def complementor(*sources, **attrs):
    '''
    Returns a decorator to be applied to a class in order to add attributes
    in a smart way:

    - if the attribute is a dictionary and exists in the decorated class, it's
      updated.

    - If a list, tuple or set, the new value is appended.

    - Methods declared in the class that are replacements are renamed to
      "_super_<name>", but the docstring and names are copied to their
      replacement.

    - All other values are replaced.

    The following code tests show each case::

    :param sources: If any positional arguments `sources` are given then for
                    each of them:

                    - If it's not a class (an instance of `type`) and it has a
                      `__name__`, it will be updated into `attrs` and treated
                      according to the rules before.

                    - If it's a class all it's public non-method attributes
                      are updated into `attrs`, and all it's methods (public
                      or private) are updated as well.

    Notice the order in which this is done: class takes precedence over other
    kind of sources, and sources takes precedence over keyword arguments.

@contextmanager
def weaved(target, *sources, **attrs):
    '''
    Returns a context manager that weaves `target` with all the `sources` and
    the `attrs` weaved into it. This method yields the weaved object into the
    context manager, so you have access to it. Upon exiting the context
    manager, the `target` is reset to it's previous state (if possible).

    For example, in the following code::

        >>> class Test(object):
        ...    def f(self, n):
        ...        return n

        >>> test = Test()


    You may want to record each call to ``f`` on the ``test`` object::

        >>> def f(self, n):
        ...     print('Log this')
        ...     return super(_ec, self).f(n) # Notice the assignment to _ec

        >>> with weaved(test, f) as test:
        ...    _ec = test.__class__ # Needed
        ...    test.f(10)
        Log this
        10

    But once you leave the context, ``test`` will stop logging::

        >>> test.f(10)
        10

    You may nest several calls to this:

        >>> def f2(self, n):
        ...    print('Done it')
        ...    return super(_ec2, self).f(n)

        >>> with weaved(test, f) as test:
        ...    _ec = test.__class__
        ...    with weaved(test, f=f2) as test:
        ...        _ec2 = test.__class__
        ...        test.f(10)
        ...    test.f(12)
        Done it
        Log this
        10
        Log this
        12

        >>> test.f(10)
        10
