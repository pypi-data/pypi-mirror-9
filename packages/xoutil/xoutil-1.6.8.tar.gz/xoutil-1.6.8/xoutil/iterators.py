    (i.e, not a scalar according to the callabled passed in `is_scalar`)::

    If `depth` is None the collection is flattened recursiverly until the
    "bottom" is reached. If `depth` is an integer then the collection is
    flattened up to that level. `depth=0` means not to flatten. Nested
    iterators are not "exploded" if under the stated `depth`::

        # In the following doctest we use ``...range(...X)`` because the string
        # repr of range differs in Py2 and Py3k.

                   by cycling over `fill`.
