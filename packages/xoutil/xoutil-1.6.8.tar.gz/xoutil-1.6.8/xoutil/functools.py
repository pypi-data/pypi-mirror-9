        up to the `maxsize` most recent calls.  It can save time when an
        expensive or I/O bound function is periodically called with the same
        arguments.

        Since a dictionary is used to cache results, the positional and
        keyword arguments to the function must be hashable.

        If `maxsize` is set to None, the LRU feature is disabled and the cache
        can grow without bound.  The LRU feature performs best when maxsize is
        a power-of-two.

        If `typed` is set to True, function arguments of different types will
        be cached separately.  For example, ``f(3)`` and ``f(3.0)`` will be
        treated as distinct calls with distinct results.

        To help measure the effectiveness of the cache and tune the `maxsize`
        parameter, the wrapped function is instrumented with a cache_info()
        function that returns a named tuple showing hits, misses, maxsize and
        currsize.  In a multi-threaded environment, the hits and misses are
        approximate.

        The decorator also provides a ``cache_clear()`` function for clearing
        or invalidating the cache.

        The original underlying function is accessible through the
        ``__wrapped__`` attribute.  This is useful for introspection, for
        bypassing the cache, or for rewrapping the function with a different
        cache.

        An `LRU (least recently used)`__ cache works best when the most recent
        calls are the best predictors of upcoming calls (for example, the most
        popular articles on a news server tend to change each day).  The
        cache's size limit assures that the cache does not grow without bound
        on long-running processes such as web servers.
