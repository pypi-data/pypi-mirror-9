def generate_password(pass_phrase, level=DEFAULT_PASS_PHRASE_LEVEL):
    '''Generate a password from a source `pass-phrase` and a security `level`.

    :param pass_phrase: String pass-phrase to be used as base of password
                        generation process.

    :param level: Numerical security level (the bigger the more secure, but
                  don't exaggerate!).

    When `pass_phrase` is a valid string, `level` means a generation method.
    Each level implies all other with an inferior numerical value.

    There are several definitions with numerical values for `level` (0-4):

    :data:`PASS_PHRASE_LEVEL_BASIC`

        Generate the same pass-phrase, just removing invalid characters and
        converting the result to lower-case.

    :data:`PASS_PHRASE_LEVEL_MAPPED`

        Replace some characters with new values: ``'e'->'3'``, ``'i'->'1'``,
        ``'o'->'0'``, ``'s'->'5'``.

    :data:`PASS_PHRASE_LEVEL_MAPPED_MIXED`

        Consonants characters before 'M' (included) are converted to
        upper-case, all other are kept lower-case.

    :data:`PASS_PHRASE_LEVEL_MAPPED_DATED`

        Adds a suffix with the year of current date ("<YYYY>").

    :data:`PASS_PHRASE_LEVEL_STRICT`

        Randomly scramble previous result until unbreakable strong password is
        obtained.

    If `pass_phrase` is ``None`` or an empty string, generate a "secure salt"
    (a password not based in a source pass-phrase).  A "secure salt" is
    generated by scrambling the concatenation of a random phrases from the
    alphanumeric vocabulary.

    Returned password size is ``4*level`` except when a `pass-phrase` is given
    for `level` <= 4 where depend on the count of valid characters of
    `pass-phrase` argument, although minimum required is warranted.  When
    `pass-phrase` is ``None`` for `level` zero or negative, size ``4`` is
    assumed.  First four levels are considered weak.

    Maximum size is defined in the :data:`MAX_PASSWORD_SIZE` constant.

    Default level is :data:`PASS_PHRASE_LEVEL_MAPPED_DATED` when using a
    pass-phrase.
