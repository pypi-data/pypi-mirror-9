        The excellent `scales`_ library to collect in-process metrics (see Coda Haleâ€™s
        CodeConf talk "`Metrics everywhere`_" among many others for reasons why you
        might want use it) comes with a `flask`_-based HTTP server that allows viewing
        the collected measurements and dumping them as JSON. But if you already are in
        a web application using `pyramid`_, there's no real need to spin up yet another
        thread, open another port etc. to do this.
        
        Instead, you can simply include ``pyramid_scales`` like so::
        
            import pyramid.config
            config = pyramid.config.Configurator()
            # rest of your configuration goes here
            config.include('pyramid_scales')
        
        This registeres a view below the URL ``/scales/`` where you can view your
        application's metrics. If you need more control, register the
        ``pyramid_scales.scales_stats`` view yourself in whichever way you need.
        
        This package is compatible with Python version 2.7 (scales itself does not
        support Python3 yet, so there's no point here).
