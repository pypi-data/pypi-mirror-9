Easily build a webservice API on top of a cubic web database.

Once activated, the cube provides new controllers (their regid is
`webservices`) which respond on the rest path of entities, if the requests
matches one of the following condition:

-   Content-Type == 'application/json'
-   Accept == 'application/json'

The following API is automatically provided for all the entities:

.. csv-table::

   HTTP, action
   `GET /etype?filter=xxx`, return a list of entities matching the filter
   `POST /etype`, create a new entity
   `GET /etype/1234`, return a particular entity
   `PUT /etype/1234`, update an entity
   `DELETE /etype/1234`, delete an entity
