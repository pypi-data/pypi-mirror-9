0.5.2

 * Added the ability to specify a list of media URLs. The {% media %} template tag will alternate through them when rendering templates. This allows you to distribute media across media servers, and permit more simultaneous connects than the browser would allow for a single server.
 * Added <generic-key> to database tags.
