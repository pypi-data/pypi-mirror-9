        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yafowil>`_ 
        
        It is based on XING's `wysihtml5 <https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5>`_
        editor with optionally `bootstrap-wysihtml5 <https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5>`_ integration.

        Note

        base files.

        - Replace stylesheet options with stylesheets and allow a string as path as
          well as a list of paths to stylesheets to include in wysihtml5 configuration.
          [thet]
        
        - Add configuration options to control the toolbar (font-styles, color,
          emphasis, lists, html, link, image plus extra justify toolbar buttons) as
          well as additional extra configuration options (toolbar size, focus after
          loading, resize automatically and additional stylesheet).
          [thet]
        
        - Pass Javascript widget configuration options via data attributes.
          [thet]
        
        - Don't register the bootstrap.min.js file. This should be done wether with
          yafowil.bootstrap or another Twitter Bootstrap integration package.
          [thet]
        
        - Fix resource group names to reflect the package name.
