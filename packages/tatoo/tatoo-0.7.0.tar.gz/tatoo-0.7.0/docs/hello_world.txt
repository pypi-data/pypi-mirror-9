Hello, world!
=============

The first thing you need is an :class:`~tatoo.environment.Environment`
instance. Environment is basically a container for all runtime parameters,
configuration, tasks and so forth::

    from tatoo import Environment
    env = Environment('myenv')

Each environment instance should have a name. This helps to identify
the currently used environment if there are multiple environments are
defined.

Once you have an environment instance,
you can transform a function into a task by decorating it through
:meth:`~tatoo.environment.Environment.task` decorator::

    @env.task
    def hello():
        print('Hello, world!')

Putting all together in ``tasks.py`` file::

    from tatoo import Environment

    env = Environment()

    @env.task
    def hello():
        print('Hello, world!')

Executing the task is simple as::

    >>> from tasks import hello
    >>> hello.apply()  # prints Hello, world!
