Welcome to tatoo's documentation!
=================================

Tatoo is extensible task toolkit.

- No global state,
- The only hardcoded behaviour is to be configurable,
- Extremely extensible.

It aims to provide a generic way to inspect the runtime environment such as
platform specifics (e.g. OS), current configuration parameters, registered
tasks and so forth,
and to be configurable as much as possible without any sort of monkey patching.
Although such configurability may be painful, tatoo provides sensible
defaults.
