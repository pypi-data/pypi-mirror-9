    Fix the given input OHSU QIN AIRC DICOM files as follows:

    - Replace the ``Patient ID`` value with the subject number, e.g.
        ``Sarcoma001``

    - Add the ``Body Part Examined`` tag

    - Standardize the file name

    The ``Body Part Examined`` tag is set as follows:

    - If the collection is ``Sarcoma``, then the body part is the
        :meth:`qipipe.staging.sarcoma_config.sarcoma_location`.
    
    - Otherwise, the body part is the capitalized collection name, e.g.
        ``BREAST``.
        
    The output file name is standardized as follows:

    - The file name is lower-case

    - The file extension is ``.dcm``
    
    - The scan type is appended to the fie name, e.g. ``_t1``

    - Each non-word character is replaced by an underscore
