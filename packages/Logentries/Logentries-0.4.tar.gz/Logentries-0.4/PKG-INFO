Description: Logentries Logger
        =================
        
        This is a plugin library to enable logging to Logentries from the Python
        Logger. Logentries is a real-time log management service on the cloud.
        More info at https://logentries.com. Note that this plugin is
        **asynchronous**.
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        To use this library, you must first create an account on Logentries.
        This will only take a few moments.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        To install this library, use the following command:
        
        ``pip install logentries``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from logentries import LogentriesHandler
            import logging
        
            log = logging.getLogger('logentries')
            log.setLevel(logging.INFO)
            test = LogentriesHandler(LOGENTRIES_TOKEN)
        
            log.addHandler(test)
        
            log.warn("Warning message")
            log.info("Info message")
        
            sleep(10)
        
        Configure
        ---------
        
        The parameter ``LOGENTRIES_TOKEN`` needs to be filled in to point to a
        file in your Logentries account.
        
        In your Logentries account, create a logfile, selecting ``Token TCP`` as
        the source\_type. This will print a Token UUID. This
        is the value to use for ``LOGENTRIES_TOKEN``.
        
        The appender will attempt to send your log data over TLS over port 443,
        otherwise it will send over port 80.
        
        You are now ready to start logging
