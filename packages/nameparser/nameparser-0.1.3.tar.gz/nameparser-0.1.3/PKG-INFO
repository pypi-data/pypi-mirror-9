Description: A simple Python module for parsing human names into their individual components.
        
        Components::
        
            * Title
            * First name
            * Middle names
            * Last names
            * Suffixes
        
        Works for a variety of common name formats for latin-based languages. Over 
        100 unit tests with example names. Should be unicode safe but it's fairly untested.
        
        HumanName instances will pass an equals (==) test if their lower case unicode
        representations are the same.
