<h1>Code and project management<a class="headerlink" href="#code-and-project-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We use our <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/divio/django-cms">GitHub project</a> for managing both django CMS code
and development activity.</p>
<p>This document describes how we manage tickets on GitHub. By &#8220;tickets&#8221;, we mean GitHub issues and
pull requests (in fact as far as GitHub is concerned, pull requests are simply a species of issue).</p>
<div class="section" id="issues">
<h2>Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="raising-an-issue">
<h3>Raising an issue<a class="headerlink" href="#raising-an-issue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="first admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>If you think you have discovered a security issue in our code, please report
it <strong>privately</strong>, by emailing us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:security&#37;&#52;&#48;django-cms&#46;org">security<span>&#64;</span>django-cms<span>&#46;</span>org</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><p>Please <strong>do not</strong> raise it on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>IRC</li>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>either of our email lists</li>
</ul>
<p>or in any other public forum until we have had a chance to deal with it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Except in the case of security matters, of course, you&#8217;re welcome to raise issues in any way that
suits you - <a class="reference internal" href="contributing.html#community-resources"><em>on one of our email lists, or the IRC channel</em></a> or in person
if you happen to meet another django CMS developer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very helpful though if you don&#8217;t just raise an issue by mentioning it to people, but actually
file it too, and that means creating a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/divio/django-cms/issues/new">new issue on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an art to creating a good issue report.</p>
<p>The <em>Title</em> needs to be both succint and informative. &#8220;show_sub_menu displays incorrect nodes when
used with soft_root&#8221; is helpful, whereas &#8220;Menus are broken&#8221; is not.</p>
<p>In the <em>Description</em> of your report, we&#8217;d like to see:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>how to reproduce the problem</li>
<li>what you expected to happen</li>
<li>what did happen (a traceback is often helpful, if you get one)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-your-issue-accepted">
<h3>Getting your issue accepted<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-your-issue-accepted" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Other django CMS developers will see your issue, and will be able to comment. A core developer may
add further comments, or a <a class="reference internal" href="#label-reference"><em>label</em></a>.</p>
<p>The important thing at this stage is to have your issue <em>accepted</em>. This means that we&#8217;ve agreed
it&#8217;s a genuine issue, and represents something we can or are willing to do in the CMS.</p>
<p>You may be asked for more information before it&#8217;s accepted, and there may be some discussion before
it is. It could also be rejected as a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-non-issue"><em class="xref std std-term">non-issue</em></a> (it&#8217;s not actually a problem) or
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-won-t-fix"><em class="xref std std-term">won&#8217;t fix</em></a> (addressing your issue is beyond the scope of the project, or is incompatible
with our other aims).</p>
<p>Feel free to explain why you think a decision to reject your issue is incorrect - very few
decisions are final, and we&#8217;re always happy to correct our mistakes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-we-process-tickets">
<h2>How we process tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#how-we-process-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tickets should be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>given a <a class="reference internal" href="#label-status"><em>status</em></a></li>
<li>marked with <a class="reference internal" href="#label-need"><em>needs</em></a></li>
<li>marked with a kind</li>
<li>marked with the components they apply to</li>
<li>marked with <a class="reference internal" href="#label-others"><em>miscellaneous other labels</em></a></li>
<li>commented</li>
</ul>
<p>A ticket&#8217;s <em>status</em> and <em>needs</em> are the most important of these. They tell us two key things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>status</em>: what stage the ticket is at</li>
<li><em>needs</em>: what next actions are required to move it forward</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, these labels need to be applied carefully, according to the rules of this system.</p>
<p>GitHub&#8217;s interface means that we have no alternative but to use colours to help identify our
tickets. We&#8217;re sorry about this. We&#8217;ve tried to use colours that will cause the fewest issues for
colour-blind people, so we don&#8217;t use green (since we use red) or yellow (since we use blue) labels,
but we are aware it&#8217;s not ideal.</p>
<div class="section" id="django-cms-ticket-processing-system-rules">
<h3>django CMS ticket processing system rules<a class="headerlink" href="#django-cms-ticket-processing-system-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<li>when closed, tickets <strong>must</strong> have either a healthy (blue) or dead (black) status</li>

<h3>Status<a class="headerlink" href="#status" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first thing we do is decide whether we accept the ticket, whether it&#8217;s a pull request or an
issue. An accepted status means the ticket is healthy, and will have a blue label.</p>
<p>Basically, it&#8217;s good for open tickets to be healthy (blue), because that means they are going
somewhere.</p>

<p>Preferably, the ticket should either be accepted (blue), rejected (black) or marked as having
