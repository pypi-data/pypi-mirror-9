History
-------

The python package was renamed from ``trytond_ups`` to ``openlabs_shipping_ups``
in version 3.4. If you are on version 3.2 of tryton, you should use
`trytond_ups <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/trytond_ups>`_ from PYPI instead.

Installation
------------

From pypi: ``pip install openlabs_shipping_ups``

Migration from v3.2 to 3.4+
---------------------------

The module was renamed from `ups` to `shipping_ups` to be consistent in naming
with all the other shipping modules. This migration could not be automated with
the migration API. 

`A migration script <https://gist.github.com/sharoonthomas/d173234e625d5a8ce90a>`_
is available and the usage instructions can be seen on the comments.
