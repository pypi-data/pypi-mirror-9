Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a tinymce plugin for easily adding youtube videos.
        
        Only tested with latest Products.TinyMCE.
        
        Warning
        ^^^^^^^
        
        You'll likely need to allow iframe as a custom tag via html filtering for
        this plugin to work.
        
        
        Another warning
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Due to the way most modern browsers help protect against XSS attacks, after
        you save a form where you added a video with tinymce, you'll likely see the
        rendering of the video is blocked initially. Just reload the browser once more
        to see the video added.
        
        See http://glicksoftware.com/blog/disable-html-filtering for tips on getting
        around this annoyance.
