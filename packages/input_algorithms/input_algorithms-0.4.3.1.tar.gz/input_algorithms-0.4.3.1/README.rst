Why the name?
=============

I got the inspiration from the movie Transcendence when a character says
something to the effect of "We could do this if we had better input algorithms".

Installation
------------

Use pip!:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install input_algorithms

Or if you're developing it:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .
    pip install -e ".[tests]"

Tests
-----

To run the tests in this project, just use the helpful script:
