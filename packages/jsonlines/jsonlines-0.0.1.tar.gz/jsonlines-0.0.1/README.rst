jsonlines
=========

Python library with helpers for the *jsonlines* format.

The *jsonlines* file format is very straight-forward: it's simply a UTF-8
encoded text file with one JSON value per line. See http://jsonlines.org/ for
details.


TODO
====

* Custom loads/dumps flags, e.g. ``loads_kwargs`` or something similar.
* Expand tests
* Write docs / usage instructions
