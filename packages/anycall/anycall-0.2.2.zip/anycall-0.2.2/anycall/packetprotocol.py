class PacketProtocol(protocol.Protocol):
    """
    Implements a packet protocol on top of a stream protocol.
    
    Each packet has a type and a content. Both are strings.
    The packet types have to be registered before the connection is made. Only
    registered types can be used for sending and receiving.
    
    The type is not sent as a string. Instead we send the hash value of it.
    This can potentially lead to collisions which cause the registration to fail.
    Since the types are usally hard-coded this is not a problem in pratice.
    
    This class is designed to be overwritten. If a packet is received, its content
    is passed to `self.on_[typename](packet)`. If there is no such method, an error
    is logged and the connection is closed.
