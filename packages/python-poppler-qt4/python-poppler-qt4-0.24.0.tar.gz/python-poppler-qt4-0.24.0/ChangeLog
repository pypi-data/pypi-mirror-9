Version 0.18.3 -- 

* Added version() function, returning the version of python-poppler-qt4
  as a tuple of ints e.g. (0, 18, 3)
* Added poppler_version() function, returning the version of the Poppler-
  Qt4 library (if the version could be determined on build time), as a
  tuple of ints, e.g. (0, 24, 5). If on build time the version of
  Poppler-Qt4 could not be determined and was not specified, an empty
  tuple might be returned.
