========

*TaskFlow is a Python library that helps to make task execution easy,
consistent and reliable.* [#f1]_

Examples
--------

While developing TaskFlow the team has worked *hard* to make sure the various
concepts are explained by *relevant* examples. Here are a few selected examples
to get started (ordered by *perceived* complexity):

To explore more of these examples please check out the `examples`_ directory
in the TaskFlow `source tree`_.

.. note::

    If the examples provided are not satisfactory (or up to your
    standards) contributions are welcome and very much appreciated to help
    improve them. The higher the quality and the clearer the examples are the
    better and more useful they are for everyone.

Considerations
--------------

Things to consider before (and during) development and integration with
TaskFlow into your project:

* Read over the `paradigm shifts`_ and engage the team in `IRC`_ (or via the
  `openstack-dev`_ mailing list) if these need more explanation (prefix
  ``[TaskFlow]`` to your emails subject to get an even faster response).
* Follow (or at least attempt to follow) some of the established
  `best practices`_ (feel free to add your own suggested best practices).
* Keep in touch with the team (see above); we are all friendly and enjoy
  knowing your use cases and learning how we can help make your lives easier
  by adding or adjusting functionality in this library.

.. [#f1] It should be noted that even though it is designed with OpenStack
         integration in mind, and that is where most of its *current*
         integration is it aims to be generally usable and useful in any
         project.
