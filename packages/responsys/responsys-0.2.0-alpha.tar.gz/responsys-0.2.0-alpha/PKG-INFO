Description: # Responsys Interact API python client #
        
        A python library providing access to the Responsys Interact API.
        
        ## Install ##
        
        Via pypi:
        
        	pip install responsys
        
        Via source package:
        
        	cd responsys/
        	pip install .
        
        ## Usage ##
        
        The [InteractClient](./responsys/client.py) provides the methods needed to work with
        the Interact API:
        
        	>>> from responsys.client import InteractClient
        	>>> client = InteractClient(username, password, pod)
        	>>> client.connect()
        	>>> client.merge_list_members(interact_object, records, merge_rules)
        	>>> client.disconnect()
        
        Using the client class as a context manager will automatically connect using the credentials
        provided, and disconnect upon context exit:
        
        	>>> with InteractClient(username, password, pod) as client:
        	...     client.merge_list_members(interact_object, records, merge_rules)
        
        Since responsys limits the number of active sessions per account, this can help ensure you
        don't leave unused connections open.
        
        ## Development/Testing ##
        
        Tests can be run via setuptools:
        
        	python setup.py nosetests
        
        Installing requirements for development environment can be accomplished via pip:
        
        	pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Testing within a dev environment can be accomplished via ```nosetests```.
