        Overview
        ========
        
        Petrel offers some important improvements over the storm.py module provided with Storm:
        
        * Topologies are implemented in 100% Python
        * Petrel's packaging support automatically sets up a Python virtual environment for your topology and makes it easy to install additional Python packages.
        * "petrel.mock" allows testing of single components or single chains of related components.
        * Petrel automatically sets up logging for every spout or bolt and logs a stack trace on unhandled errors.
