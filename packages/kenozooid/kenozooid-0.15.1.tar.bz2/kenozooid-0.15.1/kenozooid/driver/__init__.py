    Device driver interface.

    Every device driver implementation has to implement at least this
    interface.

    Software using this interface shall get driver instance using
    `DeviceDriver.scan` method.

    There is only one known method for platform independent device scanning
    and it applies to USB devices only. Library pyUSB can be used to find
    devices, i.e.::

        import usb.core
        dev = usb.core.find(idVendor=0x0403, idProduct=0x6001)
        dev.write(...)
        dev.read(...)

    Above code uses not released yet pyUSB 1.0 interfaces. Device's `write`
    and `read' methods can be used to communicate with a device. It is not yet
    possible to determine port of a device (i.e. /dev/ttyUSB0, COM1, etc.),
    so it is not possible to bind this method with pySerial usage when
    required.
