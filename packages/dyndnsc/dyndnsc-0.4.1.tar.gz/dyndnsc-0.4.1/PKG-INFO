        *Dyndnsc* is both a script to be used directly as well as a re-usable and
        hopefully extensible python package for sending updates to dynamic
        dns (ddns, dyndns) services. It is compatible with ipv4 as well as
        ipv6. It ships with support for a bunch of different services and it has an
        extensible configuration format that allows using foreign, but compatible
        services. *Dyndnsc* ships many different IP detection mechanisms, support
        for configuring multiple services in one place and it has a daemon mode for
        running unattended. It has a plugin architecture for supporting notification
        services like Growl or OS X Notification center.  
        
        
        Quickstart / Documentation
        ==========================
        See the Quickstart section of the http://dyndnsc.readthedocs.org/
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ # from pypi:
            $ pip install dyndnsc
        
            $ # from downloaded source:
            $ python setup.py install
        
            $ # directly from github:
            $ pip install https://github.com/infothrill/python-dyndnsc/zipball/develop
          
        
        Requirements
        ============
        * Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2+
        
        
        Status
        ======
        *Dyndnsc* is currently still in alpha stage, which means that any interface can
        still change at any time. For this to change, it shall be sufficient to have
        documented use of this package which will necessitate stability (i.e.
        community process).

          different updater protocols.
