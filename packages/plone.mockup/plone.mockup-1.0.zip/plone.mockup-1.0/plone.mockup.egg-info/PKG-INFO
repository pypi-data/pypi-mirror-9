Description: plone.mockup
        ============
        
        This is the integration package of ``mockup`` for Plone. Basically, it packages
        ``mockup`` as a Python egg. For mockup itself, see
        https://github.com/plone/mockup
        
        This package uses the ``git submodule`` feature. If you use
        ``buildout.coredev``, ``mr.developer`` will make sure that the submodule is
        checked out properly. If you do it manually, you can do one of the following::
        
            $ git clone git@github.com/plone/mockup.git --recursive
        
        or::
            
            $ git clone git@github.com/plone/mockup.git
            $ cd mockup
            $ git submodule update --init --recursive
        
        .. note::
            Please, don't develop mockup in here. git submodules are known to be
            cumbersome in some circumstances. Do your mockup development directly in a
            separate, dedicated mockup checkout.
