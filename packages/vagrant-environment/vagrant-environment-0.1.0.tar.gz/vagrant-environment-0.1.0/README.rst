vagrant-environment - Tools for manipulating Vagrant environments
=================================================================

``vagrant-environment`` is a Python wrapar for the `Vagrant`_
command-line tool ``vagrant``.


Requirements
------------

``vagrant-environment`` requires:

* `Vagrant`_ (tested with version 1.6.3 under 64-bit Linux).
* Python 2.7.


Installation
------------

Once you have installed VirtualBox and Vagrant, do the usual::

    $ pip install vagrant-environment

That will install ``vagrant-environment`` and its Python dependencies. You
might want to do that within a virtualenv.
