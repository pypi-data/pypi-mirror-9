2004-04-18    Remi Delon <remi@cherrypy.org>
    * CherryPy-0.10-final released
    * Added two new options to the compiler for specifying which shebang line and encoding to use for the generated .py file. Options are called -S|--shebang and -E|--encoding. Example: python ../cherrypy.py -S "#!/usr/local/bin/python" --encoding "latin-1" Root.cpy
    * Change prototype of logMessage to logMessage(message, level=0) and updated HowTo
    * Tweaked cherrypcgi.cgi to remove "last-modified" header as this doesn't work well with Apache
    * Fixed multiple-cookie handling bug with Konqueror
    * Improved code that handles client certificate verification in SSL mode (hopefully there will be a HowTo that explains how to use that soon)
    * Updated HowTo about sessions to show usage of cleanUpDelay
    * Changed "server" string returned by HTTP server to be "CherryPy/<version>"

2004-03-07    Remi Delon <remi@cherrypy.org>
    * CherryPy-0.10-rc1 released
    * Old sessions are now cleaned-up. New function "cleanUpOldSessions" has been added for custom sessions. See HowTo about sessions for more information.
    * Made a small change in Form.cpy so people can use "mandatory=1" as well as their own validation function. Thanks to Scott Luck for that fix.
    * Improved the "Mail" module with a new "sendHtmlMail" method that supports sending HTML mails. The date is also now included by default in the e-mail header. Updated the doc as well. Thanks to Enrico Morelli for this code
    * Added "request.peerCertificate" variable that contains the peer certificate (if any) in SSL mode (thanks to Chris Foote for this)
    * Fixed aspect behavior when using multiple inheritance. Now respects the "russian doll" effect ... Added a couple of regression tests about this
    * When a file is being uploaded, its content-type is now available through request.fileTypeMap[<fieldName>] (if the browser sent the information)
    * "getPath" now takes an optional argument: "includeRequestBase" which defaults to 1. If it is set to 0, then the returned URl no longer includes the domain name (this makes it easier for CherryPy servers that run behind Apache with mod_rewrite)
    * Changed CookieSessionAuthenticate: "isGoodLoginAndPassword" has been renamed "checkLoginAndPassword" and should return None if it's ok and an error message such as "Wrong login/password" or "Account disabled" if it's not ok.
    * Fix in CookieSessionAuthenticate: the login is now stored in "request.login" as opposed to "self.login". This makes it thread-safe
    * Small fix in CookieSessionAuthenticate: if client has no session at all, display the "No cookie message"
    * Updated request.filenameMap so it handles the case when several file fields have the same name
    * Now catch the case where someone uses "hidden" but the method is not a mask or a view
    * Fixed bug when setting "_reverseDNS" in config file

    * Fixed a bug with URL <-> Method mapping and added a regression test about it
    * Fixed a glitch in prettyMap (in lib/MaskTools.cpy)

2004-01-06    Remi Delon <remi@cherrypy.org>
    * CherryPy-0.10-beta released
    * CherryPy now uses 4 spaces instead of tabs in its source code. It also uses spaces in the generated .py file. I've added a new regression test called "testIndentation.py" about this and I've updated the tutorial.
    * No longer enforces a parent class name to match CherryClass's name pattern (because a CherryClass could inherit from any class)
    * Added new special function "initRequestBeforeParse" that allows us to tell CherryPy not to parse POST data (by setting request.parsePostData=0) and to parse the POST data ourselves (by reading on request.rfile). This allows for instance to stream an uploaded file directly to the filesystem. Added a new HowTo about this.
    * Added new section 1.4 in the tutorial to explain how to stop the server
    * Changed the abstract in the tutorial to use same text as the one on CherryPy.org
    * Updated the HOME page of cherrypy.org
    * Restored Jython compatibility (was broken in 0.9)
    * Session data is now accessed through "request.sessionMap" instead of just "sessionMap". This is because "sessionMap" wasn't thread-safe.
    * Small change to CherryFileObject to get rid of annoying error messages with Python-2.3 when old sockets are being deleted.
    * Now setting the cookie version for CherryPySession cookie

2003-11-25    Remi Delon <remi@cherrypy.org>

    * Updated "prettyMap" in maskTools
    * Changed the search functionality on cherrypy.org to use Google
    * initThread and initProcess now take respectively "threadIndex" and "processIndex" as argument and updated documentation accordingly

    * Added a file "Contributors.txt" that lists everybody who contributed to the project
    * Added the ability to close CGTL tags "ala XML" (for instance, <py-eval="name"/>) and updated tutorial accordingly (thanks to Damien Boucard for this code)

    * Check that response type is not unicode
    * Added the ability to serve static files by specifying the full name of the file, and updated tutorial accordingly). This can be used for instance to serve favicon.ico
    * Fixed some typos in the Standard Library reference (thanks to Damien Boucard)
    * Documented CookieSessionAuthenticate.cpy in the standard library documentation
    * removed --psyco flag (same effect can be achieved using initProgram) and updated HowTo accordingly
    * Added the ability to have multiple same sections in a given CherryClass and updated tutorial accordingly
    * Added initProgram, initThread, initProcess and initAfterBind special functions and updated tutorial accordingly
    * Added prettyMap mask to MaskTools.cpy (thanks to Mario Ruggier)
    * Fixed bug that caused the HTTP server to try to use HTTP/1.1 and wasn't working with python-2.3

    * Now trapps Ctrl-C even on Windows (if timeoutmodule is there or if using python-2.3)
    * Added new config variable "socketHost" to control which address to bind the server to (thanks to Ulf Bartelt) and updated tutorial accordingly
    * Fixed bug in XML-RPC (wrong mapping path.methodName to CherryClass). Added a test about it in testXmlRpc.py

    * When using external templates (with py-include), CherryPy now correctly reports the template filename if an error occured while compiling the template mask
    * New module to access an Oracle database (thanks to Brent Fentem): DCOracleFull.cpy ("Full" because it exposes the full set of methods instead of just one generic "query" method)
    * When using several aspect methods, now keep the order in which they are defined
