Version 0.0.17
==============
* Fixed assert in UKF module that incorrectly required kappa
to be >= 0.

Version 0.0.16
==============

* Added multivariate_multiply to stats module.
* IMPORTANT: bug fix in the UKF RTS smoother routine. 
* various typo fixes.

Version 0.0.15
==============

A bunch of small changes and bug fixes. Documentation improvements.


Version 0.0.14
==============

The change to _dt was stupid in 0.0.13 . I put it back to _dt, and 
then added an optional dt parameter to the predict() function. 


Version 0.0.13
==============

* BREAKING CHANGE: _dt in UKF is now named dt to allow users to
rename. You will get an exception if you try to use _dt for now.

* fixed bug in EKF.


Version 0.0.12
==============
* Mostly a change in the pypi install so that the pip install will
include the test directories, and include the changelog and license.

* a few small bug fixes.


Version 0.0.11
==============

* Breaking change - moved rts_smoother into the KalmanFilter class.

* added an rts_smoother method to the UnscentedKalmanFilter class


Version 0.0.10
==============
* Modified all filters to allow a 1D array for the state vector x.
  That is, np.array([1,0]) is allowed, as well as np.array([[1],[0]])

This is a potentially breaking change to your scripts. I tried to test
all of the possibilities, but bug may remain.

* Added some tests for dimensionality of input to functions. It is far
from complete, as I don't want to go overboard running tests for every
function call. On the other hand, failures are obsucre. This will be
finalized in few releases.


 
Version 0.0.9
=============

* Added Ensemble Kalman filter
* bug fixes in UKF

Version 0.0.8
=============

Minor changes to Unscented filter, mainly naming of local variables.


Version 0.0.7
=============

Significant changes to Unscented filter. Now separate classes for the different
sigma computations, and predict/update split out. Provision for supplying your own
residual and unscented transform functions.

Version 0.0.6
=============


Version 0.0.5
=============

* Fixed and included the fixed lag smoother algorithm.
* name change - all Z and Zs to z and zs. They are vectors, not matrices.
* Optional H parameter in KalmanFilter.update() to override the H matrix. Useful if you have a variable number of measurements on each update.


Version 0.0.4
=============
* Tests and fixes for the ExtendedKalmanFilter
* Minor name changes for the methods that compute Q in common


Version 0.0.3
=============

* Reverted the name change of .x to .X in the various classes. I have no idea what I was thinking - x is a vector, so it should be lower case.

* Moved some code to a new /examples directory to reduce clutter. It is worth noting that the code in there does not run now - it is based on the old procedural unscented KF code, not the new OO based code. However, the test_UKF.py code basically implements this example as a test using the new code. This is more a change for the future.
