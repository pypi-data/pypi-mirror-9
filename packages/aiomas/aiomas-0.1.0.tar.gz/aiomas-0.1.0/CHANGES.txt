0.1.0 â€“ 2014-12-18
------------------

Initial release with the following features:

- A *request-reply channel* via TCP that allows to send multiple messages and
  to asynconously wait for results (or an exception).

- Messages can be serialized with *JSON* or *msgpack*.

- The underlying communication protocol should be compatible with `simpy.io
  <https://bitbucket.org/simpy/simpy.io/>`_ (if you use JSON and no custom
  serializers).

- Remote procedure calls (RPCs) supporting nested handlers and bidirectional
  calls (callees can make calls to the caller before returning the actual
  result).
