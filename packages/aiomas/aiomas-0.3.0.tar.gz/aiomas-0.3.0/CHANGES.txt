Changelog
=========

0.3.0 – 2015-03-11
------------------

- [CHANGE] Removed LocalProxies and everything related to it because they
  caused several problems.  That means that agents within a single container
  now also communicate via TCP sockets.  Maybe something similar but more
  robust will be reintroduced in a later release.

- [CHANGE] ``Channel.send()`` is no longer a coroutine.  It returns a Future
  instead.

- [CHANGE] Removed ``Container.get_url_for()`` which didn’t (and couldn’t) work
  as I originally assumed.

- [CHANGE] ``JSON`` is now the default codec.  msgpack and blosc don’t get
  installed by default.  This way, we only have pure Python dependencies for
  the default installation which is very handy if you are on Windows.  You can
  enable the other codecs via ``pip install -U aiomas[MsgPack]`` or ``pip
  install -U aiomas[MsgPackBlosc]``.

- [NEW] Support for Python 3.4.0 and 3.4.1 (yes, Python 3.3 with asyncio works,
  too, but I’ll drop support for it as soon as it becomes a burden) (Resolves
  `issue #6`_).

- [NEW] ``ExternalClock`` accepts a date string or an Arrow object to set the
  inital date and time.

- [NEW] ``aiomas.util.async()`` which is like ``asyncio.async()`` but registers
  a callback that instantly captures and raises exceptions, instead of delaying
  them until the task gets garbage collected.

- [NEW] The agent container adds a serializer for Arrow dates.

- [NEW] ``Proxy`` implements ``__eq__()`` and ``__hash__()``.  Two different
  proxy objects sharing the same channel and pointing to the same remote
  function will no appear to be equal.  This makes it less error prone to use
  Proxy instances as keys in dictionaries.

- [NEW] Updated and improved flow-control for ``Channel`` and its protocol.

- [NEW] Improved error handling if the future returned by ``Channel.send()``
  is triggered or cancelled by an external party (e.g., by going out of scope).
  If asyncio’s DEBUG mode is enabled, you will even get more detailed error
  messages.

- [NEW] ``MessagePackBlosc`` codec.  It uses msgpack to serialize messages and
  blosc to compress them.  It can massively reduce the message size and
  consumes very little CPU time.

- [NEW] A Contract Net example
  (https://bitbucket.org/ssc/aiomas/src/tip/examples/contractnet.py)

- [NEW] ``__str__()`` representations for agents, containers and codecs (fixes
  `issue #5`_).

- [FIX] `issue #7`_: Improved error handling and messages if the
  (de)serialization raises an exception.

- [FIX] Containers now work with unix domain sockets.

- [FIX] Various minor bug-fixes

0.2.0 - 2015-01-23
------------------

- [CHANGE] The *MsgPack* codec is now the default.  Thus, *msgpack-python* is
  now a mandatory dependency.

- [CHANGE] Renamed ``RpcClient.call`` to ``RpcClient.remote``.

- [NEW] ``aiomas.agent`` module with an ``Agent`` base class and
  a ``Container`` for agents.  Agents within a container communicate via direct
  method calls.  Agents in different containers use RPC.

- [NEW] ``aiomas.clock`` module which offers various clocks for a MAS:

  - ``AsyncioClock`` is a real-time clock and wraps asyncio's ``time()``,
    ``sleep()``, ``call_later()`` and ``call_at()`` functions.

  - ``ExternalClock`` can be synchronized with external simulation
    environments.  This allows you to *stop* the time or let it pass
    faster/slower than the wall-clock time.

- [NEW] Support for unix domain sockets in ``aiomas.channel`` and
  ``aiomas.rpc``.

- [NEW] "rpc_service()" tasks created by an RPC server can now be collected
  so that you can wait for their completion before you shutdown your program.

- [NEW] Added contents to the README and created a Sphinx project.  Only the
  API reference is done yet.  A tutorial and topical guides will follow.

- [FIX] aiomas with the JSON codec is now compatible to simpy.io



0.1.0 – 2014-12-18
------------------

Initial release with the following features:

- A *request-reply channel* via TCP that allows to send multiple messages and
  to asynconously wait for results (or an exception).

- Messages can be serialized with *JSON* or *msgpack*.

- The underlying communication protocol should be compatible with `simpy.io
  <https://bitbucket.org/simpy/simpy.io/>`_ (if you use JSON and no custom
  serializers).

- Remote procedure calls (RPCs) supporting nested handlers and bidirectional
  calls (callees can make calls to the caller before returning the actual
  result).
