    ###
    urQRd uses a new trick for performing a better denoising.
    A rank a little above the number of peaks as to be given. 
    this permit to make a filtering matrix containing the signal quasi only after a first pass.
    On a second pass the full signal is projected on a new filtering subspace done from preceding denoising.
    A higher number of iterations will decrease even more the smallest amplitudes.
