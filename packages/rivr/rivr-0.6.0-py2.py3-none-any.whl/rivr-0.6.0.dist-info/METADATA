rivr is a microweb framework inspired by djng, the reason I decided to create rivr and not use djng was that djng still depended on Django. I wanted rivr for places where I don't have Django. It is a lightweight framework which can be included along side another python application. rivr does not have a database layer, you are free to use whatever you choose.
