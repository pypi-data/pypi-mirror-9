        =================
        
        **DjangoCMS-Cascade** is the Swiss army knife for working with Django
        CMS plugins.
        
        Add DOM elements to a Django-CMS placeholder
        --------------------------------------------
        
        **DjangoCMS-Cascade** is a collection of plugins for DjangoCMS >= 3.0.8
        to add various HTML elements from CSS frameworks, such as `Twitter
        Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`__ or the `960 Grid
        System <http://960.gs/>`__ (discontinued) to any CMS
        `placeholder <http://docs.django-cms.org/en/develop/getting_started/tutorial.html#creating-templates>`__.
        Currently **Bootstrap-3.x** and **960.gs** (discontinued) are supported,
        but this module makes it very easy to add your preferred CSS frameworks.
        It is also very easy to extend an existing collection with additional
        elements.
        
        **DjangoCMS-Cascade** allows web editors to layout their pages, without
        having to edit Django templates. In most cases, one template with one
        single placeholder is enough. The editor then can subdivide that
        placeholder into rows and columns, and add additional elements such as
        buttons, rulers, or even the Bootstrap Carousel.
        
        News
        ----
        
        `Column ordering <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-column-ordering>`__
        using ``col-xx-push-n`` and ``col-xx-pull-n`` has been added.
        
        Starting with version 0.4.3, the templatetag ``bootstrap3_tags`` and the
        templates to build Boostrap3 styled menus, breadcrumbs and paginator,
        have been moved into their own repository named
        `djangocms-bootstrap3 <https://github.com/jrief/djangocms-bootstrap3>`__.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Use the scaffolding technique from the preferred CSS framework to
           subdivide a placeholder into a `grid
           system <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid>`__.
        -  Make full usage of responsive techniques, by allowing `stacked to
           horizontal <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-example-basic>`__
           classes per element.
        -  Use styled `buttons <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons>`__ to add
           links.
        -  Wrap special content into a
           `Jumbotron <http://getbootstrap.com/components/#jumbotron>`__ or a
           `Carousel <http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel>`__
        -  Add ``<img>`` and ``<picture>`` elements in a responsive way, so that
           more than one image URL point onto the resized sources, one for each
           viewport using the ``srcset`` tags or the ``<source>`` elements.
        -  It is very easy to integrate additional elements from the preferred
           CSS framework. For instance, implementing the Bootstrap Carousel,
           required 50 lines of Python code and two simple Django templates.
        -  Since all the data is stored in JSON, no database migration is
           required if a field is added, modified or removed from the plugin.
        -  Currenty **Bootstrap-3.x** is supported, but other CSS frameworks can
           be easily added in a pluggable manner.
        
        In addition to easily implement any kind of plugin,
        **DjangoCMS-Cascade** makes it possible to add reusable helpers. Such a
        helper enriches a plugin with an additional, configurable functionality:
        
        -  By making some of the plugin fields sharable, one can reuse these
           values for other plugins. This for instance is handy for the image
           and picture plugin, so that images always are resized to predefined
           values.
        -  By allowing extra fields, one can add an optional ``id`` tag, CSS
           classes and inline styles. This is configurable on a plugin and site
           base.

        History
        -------
        
        This project started as a simple
        `wrapper <https://github.com/jrief/cmsplugin-text-wrapper>`__ for the
        DjangoCMS TextPlugin, so that text elements could be shifted
        horizontally using the Grid System 960.
        
        DjangoCMS starting with version 3.0, allows to nest plugins inside other
        plugins. This feature made it possible to implement this kind of plugin.
        
        In **DjangoCMS-Cascade** version 0.4.0, the code base has been hugely
        refactored. If you where using version 0.3.2 upgrade carefully, since
        the API changed. Please contact me directly in case you need help to
        migrate your projects.
