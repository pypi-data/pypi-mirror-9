info = '''When you create a game the program is starting a server in\n
the local ip address of your computer. If the client is in the same network
\nwith your server then to connect to the server he must type the local ip
\nof the computer that run's the server.If the client is not in the same
\nnetwork with the server then the one who run's the server must open a
\nport on his router with this value: 8397.After that the client to connect
\nto the server must type the external ip of the server.To find this ip do this:
From the computer that run's the server open google and search for
\n"what's my ip".Go in the first website that you will see and there you will
see your external ip.'''
