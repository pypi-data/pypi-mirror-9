Description: Veliberator
        ===========
        
        **Veliberator** is a Python module who provides an API for getting the
        informations related to the stations of the Velib' bike renting network.

        API Usage
        ---------
        
        To retrieve the informations of a station you only have to have the ID of
        the station and a database synchronized with all the available stations.
        
        Then in your Python interpreter you can play with the API:
        ::
        
            >>> from veliberator.stations import Station
            >>> station = Station(42008)
            >>> station.informations.address
            u'128 AVENUE DANIEL CASANOVA'
        
        The informations attributes contains many data such as:
        
        * ``address``
        * ``postal_code``
        * ``city``
        * ``lat`` *(the latitude of the GPS coordonates)*
        * ``lng`` *(the longitude of the GPS coordonates)*
        * ``opened`` *(True if the station is open)*
        * ``bonus`` *(True if the station is a bonus station)*
        
        You could retrieve the live status of the station easily:
        ::
        
            >>> station.status.available
            24
            >>> station.status.free
            1
            >>> station.status.total
            25
            >>> station.status.closed
            0
        
        More useful, you can retrieve the closest stations sorted by distance:
        ::
        
            >>> station.stations_around
            [<StationInformation "42006" (23 RUE PIERRE BROSSOLETTE)>, <StationInformation "42010" (1 RUE ROBESPIERRE)>, ...]
        
        The **veliberator** script
        --------------------------
        
        Write an API for developers is a nice idea, but write an useful script
        who uses the API for the end-user is a much nicer idea.
        
        So the package provide a script named ``veliberator``.
        
        For exemple if I need to know the status of the Velib' station with the ID:
        *42008*, I simply need to run this command:
        ::
        
          $ veliberator 42008
        
        This command will display the status of the station and find other stations
        around if no parking place are available.
        
        The ``veliberator`` script can also find the Velib' stations around an
        address, by simply launching the script.
        
        Note that at the first run of the script a database will be created for
        registering all the available stations.
        
        For update or create the database you can run this command:
        ::
        
          $ veliberator --synchronize
        
        Run this command for more informations:
        ::
        
          $ veliberator -h
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        The veliberator module can be configured by a configuration file.
        Take a look on the file ``etc/veliberator-sample.cfg`` for having a example
        of the options availables.
        
        The module is going to look in your home directory if a file named
        ``.veliberator.cfg`` is present and in ``etc/veliberator.cfg`` from your
        current working directory.
