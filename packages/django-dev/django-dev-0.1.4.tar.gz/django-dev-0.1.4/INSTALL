django-dev installation
=======================


Python ``setuptools`` package is required to install django-dev.


Use the following command line to install django-dev from sources directory (containing setup.py):

    easy_install .

or

    python setup.py install


Alternatively you can install an up-to-date version of django-dev from PyPI:

    easy_install django-dev


Note: `easy_install` is bundled with ``setuptools``.
