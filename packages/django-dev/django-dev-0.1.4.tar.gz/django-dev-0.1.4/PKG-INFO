        Description
        -----------
        
        *Tools to facilitate application development for Django*
        
        Console utility for those who have more than one Django reusable application to maintain.
        
        It allows certain actions to be done in batch mode over all you apps.
        
        
        Supported commands:
        
        * **bootstrap**
        
        * **add_migrations**
        
        * **make_trans**
        
        * **list_apps**
        
        * **list_venvs**
        
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        1. Python 2.7+, 3.2+
        2. Python `virtualenv` package (or just Python 3.3+).
        
        
        How to start
        ------------
        
        1. Make a new directory, where you want your workspace to be, and step into it;
        
        2. Run ``> django-dev bootstrap`` to create basic directory structure;
        
        3. Symlink your apps into ``apps`` directory (was created by step 2 in your current directory).
        
            Example:
        
            ``ln -s /home/idle/dev/django-sitetree/sitetree /home/idle/dev/dj_workspace/apps/sitetree``
        
            Notice, that symlinked is a directory containing *models.py* (not *setup.py*).
        
        
        
        Making both South and Django 1.7+ migrations
        --------------------------------------------
        
        Use **add_migrations** command.
        
        * Relocate old South migrations into *south_migrations* and create new migrations in *migrations*:
        
          ``> django-dev add_migrations --relocate_south``
        
        * Create/update migrations both for South and Django 1.7:
        
          ``> django-dev add_migrations``
        
        * Create/update migrations for certain apps:
        
          ``> django-dev add_migrations --apps sitecats siteflags``
        
        
        
        Updating translation files
        --------------------------
        
        Use **make_trans** command.
        
        * Update existing .mo and .po files for every locale available in app:
        
          ``> django-dev make_trans``
        
        * Update/create .mo and .po files for certain locales:
        
          ``> django-dev make_trans ru en``
        
        * Update/create .mo and .po files for certain apps:
        
          ``> django-dev make_trans ru --apps sitetree sitegate``
