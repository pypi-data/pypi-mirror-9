JSON2Mantle
========================

Generate [Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle) models using JSON files.

##Quick start

### Install

```
$ sudo pip install JSON2Mantle
```

### Usage

```
$ json2mantle [-h] [--prefix PREFIX] [--author AUTHOR]
                   json_file output_dir
```

### Example

```
$ json2mantle api_model.json class --prefix XYZ --author "John Smith"
```

will generate Mantle models according to your `api_model.json` structure. The output files will be created under `output_dir` directory, the author name will be `John Smith`, and the Objective-C classes have the prefix `XYZ`.

## Features

* Supports nested JSON data, which means JSON2Mantle can generate the correct number of classes that the JSON file contains.
* Convert field name like `var_name` to `varName` automatically.
* Author name is grabbed from Address Book by default (Python 2 on OS X only).
* Python 2/3 compatible.
* Generated Objective-C files are documented.

## Note

* When reserved words in Objective-C appear, it will replace the original name with a prefix `model`. For instance, if you have a field with the name `id`, the generated one would be `modelId`.
* Only supports generating Objective-C files.
* If the input JSON file is an array, it will ask you to give a name for the array items.
