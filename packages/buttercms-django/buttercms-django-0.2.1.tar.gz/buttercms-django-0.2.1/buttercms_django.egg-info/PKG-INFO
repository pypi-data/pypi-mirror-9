Description: Butter CMS for Django
        =========================
        
        https://www.buttercms.com
        
        **Why Butter?**
        
        Butter makes setting up a company blog on Django insanely easy. It's built for Django developers to save us from hosting, DB setup, themeing, maintaining yet another Wordpress install. It's designed to be quickly integrated to an existing Django project.
        
        Butter provides a marketing friendly blogging UI, hosted on buttercms.com, and exposes blog content created via an API.
        
        This package provides thin wrapper that interacts with the Butter API and a quick start blog application.
        
        
        Setup
        -----
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install buttercms-django
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # In settings.py
            # Add buttercms to INSTALLED_APPS
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'buttercms',
            )
        
        Grab your API token from https://buttercms.com/api_token
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # In settings.py
            # Add your BUTTER_CMS_TOKEN
            BUTTER_CMS_TOKEN = '<your_api_token>'
        
        Define your blog path
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # In urls.py
            # Add your new blog path
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                ...
                url(r'^blog/', include('buttercms.urls')),
            )
        
        
        Nice job. You've now got a blog running natively in your Django project. Nothing but Python goodness. (No PHP scripts here ;))
        
        Check it out! localhost:8000/blog
        
        
        Customize the Template
        ----------------------
        We've provided a default theme but we expect you'll want skin it with your branding so we've made this as simple as extending your base template.
        
        First create a template file called blog.html that both extends your base template and your main content block.
        
        .. code:: html
        
            {% extends "base.html" %}
        
            {% block title %}My amazing blog{% endblock %}
        
            {% block content %}
                {% for post in recent_posts %}
                <div>
                    <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
                    <p><a href="#">{{ post.author.first_name }} {{ post.author.last_name }}</a> on {{ post.created }}</p>
                    <p>{{ post.body }}</p>
                </div>
                {% endfor %}
            {% endblock %}
        
        Then add this template name to your settings.py:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # In settings.py
            BUTTER_CMS_BLOG_TEMPLATE = 'blog.html'
        
        Go to localhost:8000/blog and you'll see your new custom branded blog!
        
        If you don't make sure you're both extending the correct base template (the example assumes "base.html") and 2) implementing the correct block name (the example assumes {% block content %} is the name of your main body block between the header and footer).
