              - 30 May to 9th Aug
              - 3rd Jan 1980 -- 2nd Jan 2013
              - Wed 23 Jan -> Sat 16 February 2013
              - Tuesday 29 May - Sat 2 June 2012
              - From 1 to 9 Jul
              - 14th July 1988 *(it works with single dates too!)*
              - 07:00 Tue 7th June - 17th July 3:30pm *(it ignores times, currently)*
              - Jan 2011 - Mar 2014
