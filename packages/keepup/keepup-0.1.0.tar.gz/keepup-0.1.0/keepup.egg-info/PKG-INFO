Description: **********************************
        keepup
        **********************************
        
        keepup is a command line process manager, similar to `Foreman <https://github.com/ddollar/foreman>`_ and `Honcho <https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho>`_, except it uses `npyscreen <https://code.google.com/p/npyscreen/>`_ to provide a curses interface for monitoring stdout, stderr, and for sending input to stdin.
        
        keepup uses an ``Upfile`` similar to a ``Procfile``. An example is shown below
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          # Upfiles support comments by prefixing a line with the # character
          mytask: python myscript.py
          # The following line will set the working directory for the specified task
          @mytask: /home/user/directory
        
        Support for advanced features is limited.
