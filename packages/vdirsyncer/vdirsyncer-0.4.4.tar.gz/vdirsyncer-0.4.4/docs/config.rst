=============
Configuration
=============

Vdirsyncer uses an ini-like format for storing its configuration. All values
are JSON, invalid JSON will get interpreted as string::

    x = "foo"  # String
    x = foo  # Shorthand for same string

    x = 42  # Integer

    x = ["a", "b", "c"]  # List of strings

    x = true  # Boolean
    x = false

    x = null  # Also known as None


.. _general_config:

General Section
===============

::

    [general]
    status_path = ...
    #password_command =


- ``status_path``: A directory where vdirsyncer will store metadata for the
  next sync. The data is needed to determine whether a new item means it has
  been added on one side or deleted on the other. Relative paths will be
  interpreted as relative to the configuration file's directory.

- ``password_command`` specifies a command to query for server passwords. The
  command will be called with the username as the first argument, and the
  hostname as the second.

.. versionadded:: 0.3.0
   The ``passwordeval`` parameter.

.. versionchanged:: 0.4.0
   The ``passwordeval`` parameter has been renamed to ``password_command``.

.. _pair_config:

Pair Section
============

::

    [pair pair_name]
    a = ...
    b = ...
    #collections = null
    #conflict_resolution = null

- Pair names can consist of any alphanumeric characters and the underscore.

- ``a`` and ``b`` reference the storages to sync by their names.

- ``collections``: Optional, a list of collections to synchronize. If this
  parameter is omitted, it is assumed the storages are already directly
  pointing to one collection each. Specifying a collection multiple times won't
  make vdirsyncer sync that collection more than once.

  Furthermore, there are the special values ``"from a"`` and ``"from b"``,
  which tell vdirsyncer to try autodiscovery on a specific storage.

  Examples:

  - ``collections = ["from b", "foo", "bar"]`` makes vdirsyncer synchronize the
    collections from side B, and also the collections named "foo" and "bar".

  - ``collections = ["from b", from a"]`` makes vdirsyncer synchronize all
    existing collections on either side.

- ``conflict_resolution``: Optional, define how conflicts should be handled.  A
  conflict occurs when one item (event, task) changed on both sides since the
  last sync.

  Valid values are:

  - ``"a wins"`` and ``"b wins"``, where the whole item is taken from one side.
    Vdirsyncer will not attempt to merge the two items.
  - ``null``, the default, where an error is shown and no changes are done.

.. _storage_config:

Storage Section
===============

::

    [storage storage_name]
    type = ...

- Storage names can consist of any alphanumeric characters and the underscore.

- ``type`` defines which kind of storage is defined. See :ref:`storages`.

- ``read_only`` defines whether the storage should be regarded as a read-only
  storage. The value ``true`` means synchronization will discard any changes
  made to the other side. The value ``false`` implies normal 2-way
  synchronization.

- Any further parameters are passed on to the storage class.

.. _storages:

Supported Storages
------------------

.. module:: vdirsyncer.storage

Read-write storages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These storages generally support reading and changing of their items. Their
default value for ``read_only`` is ``false``, but can be set to ``true`` if
wished.

.. autostorage:: CaldavStorage

.. autostorage:: CarddavStorage

.. autostorage:: FilesystemStorage

.. autostorage:: SingleFileStorage

Read-only storages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These storages don't support writing of their items, consequently ``read_only``
is set to ``true`` by default. Changing ``read_only`` to ``false`` on them
leads to an error.

.. autostorage:: HttpStorage
