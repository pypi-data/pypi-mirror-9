Vdirsyncer synchronizes your calendars and addressbooks between two storages_.
The most popular purpose is to synchronize CalDAV and CardDAV with a local
folder or file. The local data can then be accessed via a variety of programs_,
none of which have to know or worry about syncing to a server.

It aims to be for CalDAV and CardDAV what `OfflineIMAP
<http://offlineimap.org/>`_ is for IMAP.

Installation and usage
======================

If you already have it installed and want to quickly configure it, copy the
``example.cfg`` to ``~/.vdirsyncer/config`` [1]_ and edit it. Then run
``vdirsyncer sync``.

If that method doesn't work for you or you want a deeper understanding of what
you just did, check out `the tutorial
<https://vdirsyncer.readthedocs.org/en/stable/tutorial.html>`_.

.. [1] Or ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vdirsyncer/config`` (normally
   ``~/.config/vdirsyncer/config``) for XDG-Basedir spec compliance.
