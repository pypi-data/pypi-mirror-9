Supported Software
==================

Client applications
===================

The following software has been reported to work well with vdirsyncer, however,
none of it is regularly tested.

Calendars
---------

- khal_, a CLI calendar application supporting :doc:`vdir <vdir>`. You can use
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.FilesystemStorage` with it.

- Many graphical calendar apps such as dayplanner_, Orage_ or rainlendar_ save
  a calendar in a single ``.ics`` file. You can use
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.SingleFileStorage` with those.

Contacts
--------

- khard_, a commandline addressbook supporting :doc:`vdir <vdir>`.  You can use
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.FilesystemStorage` with it.

- `The ppl addressbook <http://ppladdressbook.org/>`_ uses a storage format
  similar to :doc:`vdir <vdir>`. There are some pitfalls though, `see the notes
  on the related issue <https://github.com/hnrysmth/ppl/issues/47>`_.

- contactquery.c_, a small program explicitly written for querying vdirs from
  mutt.

- mates_, a commandline addressbook supporting :doc:`vdir <vdir>`.

Supported servers
=================

CalDAV and CardDAV servers not listed here may work anyway.

Radicale
--------

Radicale is a very lightweight server, however, it intentionally doesn't
implement the CalDAV and CardDAV standards completely, which might lead to
issues even with very well-written clients.

That said, vdirsyncer is continuously tested against the git version and the
latest PyPI release of Radicale_. Older versions have substantial deficiencies,
and using them is neither supported nor encouraged.

- Radicale doesn't `support time ranges in the calendar-query of CalDAV
  <https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale/issues/146>`_, so setting ``start_date``
  and ``end_date`` for :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.CaldavStorage` will have
  no or unpredicted consequences.

- `Versions of Radicale older than 0.9b1 choke on RFC-conform queries for all
  items of a collection <https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale/issues/143>`_.

  You have to set ``item_types = ["VTODO", "VEVENT"]`` in
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.CaldavStorage` for vdirsyncer to work with
  those versions.

ownCloud
--------

Vdirsyncer is continuously tested against the latest version of ownCloud_.

- *Versions older than 7.0.0:* ownCloud uses SabreDAV, which had problems
  detecting collisions and race-conditions. The problems were reported and are
  fixed in SabreDAV's repo, and the corresponding fix is also in ownCloud since
  7.0.0. See :gh:`16` for more information.

FastMail
--------

Vdirsyncer is irregularly tested against FastMail_. There are no known issues
with it. `FastMail's support pages
https://www.fastmail.com/help/technical/servernamesandports.html>`_ provide the
settings to use::

    [storage cal]
    type = caldav
    url = https://caldav.messagingengine.com/
    username = ...
    password = ...

    [storage card]
    type = carddav
    url = https://carddav.messagingengine.com/
    username = ...
    password = ...

.. _FastMail: https://www.fastmail.com/

iCloud
------

Vdirsyncer is irregularly tested against iCloud_. There are no known issues
with it.

::

    [storage cal]
    type = caldav
    url = https://caldav.icloud.com/
    username = ...
    password = ...

    [storage card]
    type = carddav
    url = https://contacts.icloud.com/
    username = ...
    password = ...


.. _iCloud: http://icloud.com/

DavMail (Exchange, Outlook)
---------------------------

Using vdirsyncer with DavMail_ is currently not recommended (if even possible).

- DavMail (or the server it is proxying) handles URLs case-insensitively. See
  :gh:`144`.

.. _DavMail: http://davmail.sourceforge.net/

Baikal
------

Vdirsyncer is continuously tested against the latest version of Baikal_.

- Baikal up to ``0.2.7`` also uses an old version of SabreDAV, with the same issue as
  ownCloud, see :gh:`160`.

.. _Baikal: http://baikal-server.com/

Google
------

Vdirsyncer can currently download events from Google Calendar, but any
writing/uploading is explicitly prohibited by Google. `Google's support forum
<https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/99358>`_ explains how to set up its
CalDAV support::

    [storage cal]
    type = caldav
    url = https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/
    username = ...
    password = ...
    read_only = true

Unfortunately vdirsyncer current doesn't support Google Contacts in any way.

See :gh:`8` for the discussion.
