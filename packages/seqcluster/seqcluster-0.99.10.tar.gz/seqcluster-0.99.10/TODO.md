* add length enrichment function
* implement bayes function to decide which sequences go where
* sequence in the cluster - text
* counts of sequnces - barplot / problem: need to be in the same page, select and update :( clickId?? maybe
* annotation - datatable
* viz with http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html
* trace: tree of initial cluster and how ends up to a final cluster/s. To plot in R needs threen columns file: 
** loci1 loci2 0 %similarity => merge cluster
** loci1 newloci nseqs 0 => iter_loci
** loci2 newloci nseqs 0 => iter_loci
