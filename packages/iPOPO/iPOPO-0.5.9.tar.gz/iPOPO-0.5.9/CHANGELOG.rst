iPOPO 0.5.9
***********

Project
=======

* iPOPO now works with IronPython (tested inside Unity 3D)

iPOPO
=====

* Components raising an error during validation goes in the ERRONEOUS state,
  instead of going back to INVALID.
  This avoids trying to validate them automatically.
* The ``retry_erroneous()`` method of the iPOPO service and the ``retry`` shell
  command allows to retry the validation of an ERRONEOUS component.
* The ``@SingletonFactory`` decorator can replace the ``@ComponentFactory``
  one.
  It ensures that only one component of this factory can be instantiated at a
  time.
* The ``@Temporal`` requirement decorator allows to require a service and to
  wait a given amount of time for its replacement before invalidating the
  component or while using the requirement.
* ``@RequiresBest`` ensures that it is always the service with the best
  ranking that is injected in the component.
* The ``@PostRegistration`` and ``@PreUnregistration`` callbacks allows the
  component to be notified right after one of its services has been registered
  or will be unregistered.

HTTP
====

* The generated 404 page shows the list of registered servlets paths.
* The 404 and 500 error pages can be customized by a hook service.
* The default binding address is back to "0.0.0.0" instead of "localhost".
  (for those who used the development version)

Utilities
=========

* The ``ThreadPool`` class is now a cached thread pool. It now has a minimum
  and maximum number of threads: only the required threads are alive.
  A thread waits for a task during 60 seconds (by default) before stopping.


iPOPO 0.5.8
***********

Framework
=========

* ``FrameworkFactory.delete_framework()`` can be called with ``None`` or
  without argument. This simplifies the clean up afters tests, etc.
* The list returned by ``Framework.get_bundles()`` is always sorted by
  bundle ID.


iPOPO
=====

* Added the ``immediate_rebind`` option to the ``@Requires`` decorator.
  This indicates iPOPO to not invalidate then revalidate a component if a
  service can replace an unbound required one. This option inly applies to
  non-optional, non-aggregate requirements.


Shell
=====

* The I/O handler is now part of a ShellSession bean. The latter has the same
  API as the I/O handler so there is no need to update existing commands.
  I/O Handler write methods are now synchronized.
* The shell supports variables as arguments, e.g. ``echo $var``.
  See `string.Template <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings>`_
  for more information. The Template used in Pelix Shell allows ``.`` (dot)
  in names.
* A special variable ``$?`` stores the result of the last command which
  returned a result, i.e. anything but None or False.
* Added *set* and *unset* commands to work with variables
* Added the *run* command to execute a script file.
* Added protection against ``AttributeError`` in *threads* and *thread*


iPOPO 0.5.7
***********

Project
=======

* Code review to be more PEP-8 compliant
* `jsonrpclib-pelix <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonrpclib-pelix>`_ is now an
  install requirement (instead of an optional one)

Framework
=========

* Forget about previous global members when calling ``Bundle.update()``. This
  ensures to have a fresh dictionary of members after a bundle update
* Removed ``from pelix.constants import *`` in ``pelix.framework``:
  only use ``pelix.constants`` to access constants


Remote Services
===============

* Added support for endpoint name reuse
* Added support for synonyms: specifications that can be used on the remote
  side, or which describe a specification of another language
  (e.g. a Java interface)
* Added support for a *pelix.remote.export.reject* service property: the
  specifications it contains won't be exported, event if indicated in
  *service.exported.interfaces*.
* Jabsorb-RPC:

  * Use the common dispatch() method, like JSON-RPC

* MQTT(-RPC):

  * Explicitly stop the reading loop when the MQTT client is disconnecting
  * Handle unknown correlation ID


Shell
=====

* Added a ``loglevel`` shell command, to update the log level of any logger
* Added a ``--verbose`` argument to the shell console script
* Remote shell module can be ran as a script


HTTP
====

* Remove double-slashes when looking for a servlet


XMPP
====

* Added base classes to write a XMPP client based on
  `SleekXMPP <http://sleekxmpp.com/>`_
* Added a XMPP shell interface, to control Pelix/iPOPO from XMPP


Miscellaneous
=============

* Added an IPv6 utility module, to setup double-stack and to avoids missing
  constants bugs in Windows versions of Python
* Added a ``EventData`` class: it acts like ``Event``, but it allows to store
  a data when setting the event, or to raise an exception in all callers of
  ``wait()``
* Added a ``CountdownEvent`` class, an ``Event`` which is set until a given
   number of calls to ``step()`` is reached
* ``threading.Future`` class now supports a callback methods, to avoid to
  actively wait for a result.


iPOPO 0.5.6
***********

Project
=======

* Added samples to the project repository
* Removed the static website from the repository

* Added the project to `Coveralls <https://coveralls.io/>`_
* Increased code coverage


Framework
=========

* Added a ``@BundleActivator`` decorator, to define the bundle activator class.
  The ``activator`` module variable should be replaced by this decorator.
* Renamed specifications constants: from ``XXX_SPEC`` to ``SERVICE_XXX``


iPOPO
=====

* Added a *waiting list* service: instantiates components as soon as the iPOPO
  service and the component factory are registered
* Added ``@RequiresMap`` handler
* Added an ``if_valid`` parameter to binding callbacks decorators: ``@Bind``,
  ``@Update``, ``@Unbind``, ``@BindField``, ``@UpdateField``, ``@UnbindField``.
  The decorated method will be called if and only if the component valid.
* The ``get_factory_context()`` from ``decorators`` becomes public to ease
  the implementation of new decorators


Remote Services
===============

* Large rewriting of Remote Service core modules

  * Now using OSGi Remote Services properties
  * Added support for the OSGi EDEF file format (XML)

* Added an abstract class to easily write RPC implementations
* Added mDNS service discovery
* Added an MQTT discovery protocol
* Added an MQTT-RPC protocol, based on Node.js
  `MQTT-RPC module <https://github.com/wolfeidau/mqtt-rpc>`_
* Added a Jabsorb-RPC transport. Pelix can now use Java services and vice-versa,
  using:

  * `Cohorte Remote Services <https://github.com/isandlaTech/cohorte-remote-services>`_
  * `Eclipse ECF <http://wiki.eclipse.org/ECF>`_ and the
    `Jabsorb-RPC provider <https://github.com/isandlaTech/cohorte-remote-services/tree/master/org.cohorte.ecf.provider.jabsorb>`_


Shell
=====

* Enhanced completion with ``readline``
* Enhanced commands help generation
* Added arguments to filter the output of ``bl``, ``sl``, ``factories``
  and ``instances``
* Corrected ``prompt`` when using ``readline``
* Corrected ``write_lines()`` when not giving format arguments
* Added an ``echo`` command, to test string parsing


Services
========

* Added support for *managed service factories* in ConfigurationAdmin
* Added an EventAdmin-MQTT bridge: events from EventAdmin with an
  *event.propage* property are published over MQTT
* Added an early version of an MQTT Client Factory service


Miscellaneous
=============

* Added a ``misc`` package, with utility modules and bundles:

  * ``eventadmin_printer``: an EventAdmin handler that prints or logs the events
    it receives
  * ``jabsorb``: converts dictionary from and to the Jabsorb-RPC format
  * ``mqtt_client``: a wrapper for the `Paho <http://www.eclipse.org/paho/>`_
    MQTT client, used in MQTT discovery and MQTT-RPC.


iPOPO 0.5.5
***********

Project
=======

The license of the iPOPO project is now an Apache License 2.0.


Framework
=========

* ``get_*_service_reference*()`` methods have a default LDAP filter set to
  ``None``. Only the service specification is required, event if set to
  ``None``.

* Added a context ``use_service(context, svc_ref)``, that allows to consume a
  service in a ``with`` block:

  .. code-block:: python

     from pelix.utilities import use_service
     with use_service(bundle_context, svc_ref) as svc:
        svc.foo()

  Service will be released automatically.


iPOPO
=====

* Added the *Handler Factory* pattern : all instance handlers are created by
  their factory, called by iPOPO according to the handler IDs found in the
  factory context.
  This will simplify the creation of new handlers.

* Added a context ``use_ipopo(context)``, that allows to use the iPOPO service
  in a ``with`` block:

  .. code-block:: python

     from pelix.ipopo.constants import use_ipopo
     with use_ipopo(bundle_context) as ipopo:
        ipopo.instantiate('my.factory', 'my.instance', {})

  The iPOPO service will be released automatically.


Services
========

* Added the ConfigurationAdmin service
* Added the FileInstall service


iPOPO 0.5.4
***********

Additions
=========

Global
------

* Global speedup replacing ``list.append()`` by ``bisect.insort()``.
* Optimizations in handling services, components and LDAP filters.
* Some classes of Pelix framework and iPOPO core modules extracted to new
  modules.

iPOPO
-----

* ``@Requires`` accepts only one specification
* Added a context ``use_ipopo(bundle_context)``, to simplify the usage of the
  iPOPO service, using the keyword ``with``.
* ``get_factory_details(name)`` method now also returns the ID of the bundle
  provided the component factory, and the component instance properties.

Shell
-----

* The help command now uses the *inspect* module to list the required and
  optional parameters.
* ``IOHandler`` now has a ``prompt()`` method to ask the user to enter a line.
  It replaces the ``read()`` method, which was to buggy.

Bugs fixed
==========

Global
------

* Fixed support of Python 2.6.
* Replaced Python 3 imports conditions by ``try-except`` blocks.

iPOPO
-----

* Protection of the unregistration of factories, as a component can kill
  another one of the factory during its invalidation.

Remote Services
---------------

* Protection of the unregistration loop during the invalidation of JSON-RPC and
  XML-RPC exporters.
* The *Dispatcher Servlet* now handles the *discovered* part of the discovery
  process. This simplifies the Multicast Discovery component and suppresses a
  socket bug/feature on BSD (including Mac OS).

Shell
-----

* The ``make_table()`` method now accepts generators as parameters.
* Remote commands handling removed: ``get_methods_names()`` is not used anymore.


iPOPO 0.5.3
***********

Additions
=========

iPOPO
-----

* New ``get_factory_details(name)`` method in the iPOPO service, acting like
  ``get_instance_details(name)`` but for factories.
  It returns a dictionary describing the given factory.

* New ``factory`` shell command, which describes a component factory:
  properties, requirements, provided services, ...

HTTP Service
------------

* Servlet exceptions are now both sent to the client and logged locally

Bugs fixed
==========

Remote Services
---------------

* Data read from the servlets or sockets are now properly converted from bytes
  to string before being parsed (Python 3 compatibility).

Shell
-----

* Exceptions are now printed using ``str(ex)`` instead of ``ex.message``
  (Python 3 compatibility).

* The shell output is now flushed, both by the shell I/O handler and the
  text console. The remote console was already flushing its output.
  This allows to run the Pelix shell correctly inside Eclipse.


iPOPO 0.5.2
***********

Additions
=========

iPOPO Decorators
----------------

* An error is now logged if a class is manipulated twice. Decorators executed
  after the first manipulation, i.e. upon ``@ComponentFactory()``, are ignored.


HTTP Service
------------

* New servlet binding parameters:

  * http.name : Name of HTTP service. The name of component instance in the case
    of the basic implementation.

  * http.extra : Extra properties of the HTTP service. In the basic
    implementation, this the content of the *http.extra* property of the
    HTTP server component

* New method ``accept_binding(path, params)`` in servlets.
  This allows to refuse the binding with a server before to test the
  availability of the registration path, thus to avoid raising a meaningless
  exception.


Remote Services
---------------

* End points are stored according to their framework

* Added a method ``lost_framework(uid)`` in the registry of imported services,
  which unregisters all the services provided by the given framework.


Shell
-----

* Shell *help* command now accepts a command name to print a specific
  documentation


Bugs fixed
==========

iPOPO Decorators
----------------

* Better handling of inherited and overridden methods: a decorated method can
  now be overridden in a child class, with the name, without warnings.

* Better error logs, with indication of the error source file and line


iPOPO 0.5.1
***********

Additions
=========

Shell
-----

* The remote shell now provides a service, ``pelix.shell.remote``, with a
  ``get_access()`` method that returns the *(host, port)* tuple where the
  remote shell is waiting for clients.


HTTP Service
------------

* The HTTP service now supports the update of servlet services properties.
  A servlet service can now update its registration path property after having
  been bound to a HTTP service.
* A *500 server error* page containing an exception trace is now generated when
  a servlet fails.


Bugs fixed
==========

Framework
---------

* Bundle.update() now logs the SyntaxError exception that be raised in Python 3.

Shell
-----

* Fixed the ``threads`` command that wasn't working on Python 3.


HTTP Service
------------

* The ``bound_to()`` method of a servlet is called only after the HTTP service
  is ready to accept clients.

iPOPO 0.5
*********

API Changes
===========

Framework
---------

* ``BundleContext.install_bundle()`` now returns the ``Bundle`` object instead
  of the bundle ID.
  ``BundleContext.get_bundle()`` has been updated to accept both IDs and
  ``Bundle`` objects in order to keep a bit of compatibility

* ``Framework.get_symbolic_name()`` now returns *pelix.framework* instead of
  *org.psem2m.pelix*

* ``ServiceEvent.get_type()`` is renamed ``get_kind()``. The other name is
  still available but is declared deprecated (a warning is logged on its first
  use).


Shell
-----

* Shell command methods now take an ``IOHandler`` object in parameter instead
  of input and output file-like streams.
  This hides the compatibility tricks between Python 2 and 3 and simplifies the
  output formatting.


Additions
=========

Project
-------

* Added this "release notes" page to the web site

Framework
---------

* ``BundleContext.install_visiting(path, visitor)``:

  * Visits the given path and installs the found modules if the visitor accepts
    them

* ``BundleContext.install_package(path)`` (*experimental*):

  * Installs all the modules found in the package at the given path
  * Based on ``install_visiting()``


iPOPO
-----

* Components with a ``pelix.ipopo.auto_restart`` property set to *True* are
  automatically re-instantiated after their bundle has been updated.


Services
--------

* Remote Services: use services of a distant Pelix instance

  * Multicast discovery
  * XML-RPC transport (not fully usable)
  * JSON-RPC transport (based on a patched version of jsonrpclib)

* EventAdmin: send events (a)synchronously

iPOPO 0.4
*********

Version 0.4 fixes many bugs and provides new features:

Pelix
=====

* ``create_framework()`` utility method
* The framework has been refactored, allowing more efficient services and
  events handling

iPOPO
=====

* A component can provide multiple services
* A service controller can be injected for each provided service, to
  activate or deactivate its registration
* Dependency injection and service providing mechanisms have been refactored,
  using a basic handler concept.

Services
========

* Added a HTTP service component, using the concept of *servlet*
* Added an extensible shell, interactive and remote, simplifying the usage
  of a framework instance

iPOPO 0.3
