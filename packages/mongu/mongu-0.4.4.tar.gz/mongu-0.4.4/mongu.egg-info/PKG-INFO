Description: 
        **Mongu** is yet another Python Object-Document Mapper on top of ``PyMongo``. It's lightweight, intuitive to use and easy to understand.
        
        If those **heavy and slow layers** have nothing or more than you need, Mongu maybe the one for you.
        
        You are the only one who knows what you reall need.
        
        Therefor **Mongu does nothing but a skeleton for you to fill**.
        
        Actually, if you have ever tried to write your own ODM, you may already implemented parts of **Mongu** :D
