        ===================
        
        Simple solution to backup ec2 instances using snapshots
        
        With Simple EC2 Snapshot supports:
        
        * Hot snapshots (by default) and Cold snapshots
        * Multiple instances snapshot in one line
        * Detection of doubles
        * Filters by tags (allowing wildcards) or by instance IDs
        * Credentials file multiple with profiles
        * Limit the number of snapshots
        * Restrict snapshots to data disks only
        * Snapshot retention over time or for a given number
        
        ## Filters
        
        You can first decide to choose what to backup with Instance ID or Tags. You can set multiple tags and/or multiple instance ID at the same time.
        
        For example, if I want to snapshot 2 instances in the same command line, it should looks like this:
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -i i-ad0fcc4b -i i-56489db2
        ```
        
        To snapshot multiple instances by selecting multiple tags. Here is an example with 2 tagsi, so it should match both:
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -t Name 'instance*' -t env prod
        ```
        
        If you want to add an instance in addition of the previous tags:
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -t Name 'instance*' -t env prod -i i-ad0fcc4b
        ```
        
        ## Credentials file
        
        You can use a credentials file with several profiles. It should looks like this:
        ```ini
        [default]
        aws_region = <region>
        aws_access_key_id = <key_id>
        aws_secret_access_key = <access_key>
        
        #[profile profile1]
        #aws_region = <region>
        #aws_access_key_id = <key_id>
        #aws_secret_access_key = <access_key>
        ```
        The default one should be located in '~/.aws_cred'. You can override this with '-c' argument and '-p' to specify the profile fulfill into brackets.
        
        ## Dry Run mode
        
        Use the dry run mode (enabled by default) to see what actions will be performed when selecting a tag Name or an instance:
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -t Name "instance-name*"

        ```
        
        ## Run mode
        
        If you're ok with the previous dry run, then add '-u' for run mode:
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -t Name "instance-name*" -u
        2015-01-26 17:06:19,163 [INFO] == Launching run mode ==

        ```
        
        ## Hot vs Cold snapshot
        
        By default Hot mode is selected to perform snapshot without stopping instances. However, this may not be the best choice in some case, like for database purpose. To get a full consistent snapshot of your EC2 with attached EBS, you have to make a Cold snapshot which involves to shutdown, snapshot and start instance.
        
        To do so, you have to add '-H' option:
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -t Name "instance-name*" -u -H
        2015-01-26 17:07:10,281 [INFO] == Launching run mode ==

        ```
        
        ## Limit snapshots for auto-scaling group
        
        In auto-scaling groups, you normally have x time the same running intance. Snapshoting a huge number of time the same instance may not be very interesting. That's why you can limit the number of snapshot by using '-l' command followed by the number of desired snapshot. If I only want one:
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -t Name "instance-name*" -l 1 
        2015-01-26 17:11:27,561 [INFO] == Launching dry run mode ==
        2015-01-26 17:11:27,561 [INFO] Connecting to AWS
        2015-01-26 17:11:27,562 [INFO] Getting instances information
        2015-01-26 17:11:29,659 [INFO] Working on instance i-e16cc205 (instance-name2)
        2015-01-26 17:11:29,659 [INFO] Hot snapshot made for vol-fa415bfd(/dev/sdb)
        2015-01-26 17:11:29,659 [INFO] Hot snapshot made for vol-22465c25(/dev/sda)
        2015-01-26 17:11:29,659 [INFO] Working on instance i-6f6ec08b (instance-name1)
        2015-01-26 17:11:29,660 [INFO] The requested limit of snapshots has been reached: 1
        ```
        
        ## Remove root device from snapshots
        
        Still for auto-scaling groups, your root device may not be required to snapshot. Generally because it may be builded from a configuration manager and you just don't care of it. So the goal is to remove it from the snapshot list, you can so use '-o' option:
        
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -t Name "instance-name*" -o  
        2015-01-26 17:11:50,757 [INFO] == Launching dry run mode ==
        2015-01-26 17:11:50,757 [INFO] Connecting to AWS

        2015-01-26 17:11:52,708 [INFO] Working on instance i-6f6ec08b (instance-name1)
        2015-01-26 17:11:52,708 [INFO] Hot snapshot made for vol-9c465c9b(/dev/sdb)
        ```
        
        ## Snapshot retention
        
        There are 2 methods for snapshot retention. Choose the best one for your needs.
        
        ### Keep snapshots over time
        
        You can define the retention of your backups. You need to specify 2 args:
        
        * Number: sepcify a number for day, week... which is defined in the second arg
        * Time element: specify s(second), m(min), h(hour), d(day), w(week), M(month), y(year)
        
        So for example, if you want to keep snapshots for 3 weeks and delete the old ones, you have to set: 3 w.
        
        Here is a basic example where I want to delete snapshots older than 10 days:
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -t Name "instance-name*" -n -g 10 d
        2015-01-28 10:12:11,216 [INFO] == Launching dry run mode ==
        2015-01-28 10:12:11,217 [INFO] Connecting to AWS
        2015-01-28 10:12:11,217 [INFO] Getting instances information
        2015-01-28 10:12:13,080 [INFO] Working on instance i-e16cc205 (pmavro-test2)
        2015-01-28 10:12:14,109 [INFO] Deleting snapshot snap-b427c144 (vol-fa415bfd|/dev/sdb)
        2015-01-28 10:12:14,205 [INFO] Deleting snapshot snap-a327c153 (vol-22465c25|/dev/sda)
        2015-01-28 10:12:14,205 [INFO] Working on instance i-6f6ec08b (pmavro-test1)
        2015-01-28 10:12:14,321 [INFO] Deleting snapshot snap-a627c156 (vol-9d465c9a|/dev/sda)
        2015-01-28 10:12:14,440 [INFO] Deleting snapshot snap-a927c159 (vol-9c465c9b|/dev/sdb)
        ```
        
        Here -n is used to not make snapshots, only delete olds. But you can ask on the same line to make snapshots AND remove old ones:
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -t Name "instance-name*" -g 10 m   
        2015-01-26 17:22:43,263 [INFO] == Launching dry run mode ==

        2015-01-26 17:22:47,669 [INFO] Deleting snapshot snap-b1aebb40 (vol-9d465c9a|/dev/sda)

        ```
        
        ### Keep at least a given number of snapshots
        
        Another solution to manage the retention of your snapshots is to specify how many snapshots you want to keep. For example, if I have 5 snapshots per device of an instance and want to keep the last 4 ones:
        ```
        > ./simplec2snap.py -t Name "instance-name*" -n -d 4
