``steel`` Command
=================

Once the base ``steelscript`` package is installed, the ``steel`` shell command
is availble.  This command will normally be installed in your path so that you can
just run it from any directory.

The functions provided by ``steel`` depend on what additional packages are installed,
as each package may define additional sub-commands.

The base command from just ``steelscript`` provides the following subcommands:

* ``steel about`` - Show information about SteelScript packages installed
* ``steel install`` - Package installation
* ``steel uninstall`` - Package removal
* ``steel rest`` - Interactive shell for issuing REST commands

Most subcommands accept two options that control logging::

   Logging Parameters:
     --loglevel=LOGLEVEL  log level: debug, warn, info, critical, error
     --logfile=LOGFILE    log file, use '-' for stdout

By default, the log level is set to ``info`` and logging is sent to
the file ``~/.steelscript/steel.log``.

In addition, many commands support detailed REST logging parameters::

   REST Logging:
     --rest-debug=REST_DEBUG
                         Log REST info (1=hdrs, 2=body)
     --rest-body-lines=REST_BODY_LINES
                         Number of lines of request/response body to log

``steel install``
-----------------

The ``install`` subcommand is used to install and upgrade pacakges.  There
are a number of installation options available::

   $ steel install -h
   Usage: steel install [options]

     Package installation

   Options:
     --version             show program's version number and exit -h, --help            show this help message and exit

     Package installation options:
       -U, --upgrade       Upgrade packages that are already installed
       -d DIR, --dir=DIR   Directory to use for installation
       -g, --github        Install packages from github
       --develop           Combine with --gitlab to checkout packages
       -p PACKAGES, --package=PACKAGES
                           Package to install (may specify more than once)
       --appfwk            Install all application framework packages
       --pip-options=PIP_OPTIONS
                           Additional options to pass to pip

``steel mkworkspace``
---------------------

The ``mkworkspace`` subcommand is used to create a workspace in which you can
develop and run Steelscript scripts. It will pull all scripts from
the /examples folder in your installed Steelscript packages. Once you create a
workspace you will notice it contains the Steelscript scripts, a README file 
and ``collect_examples.py``. ``collect_examples.py`` can be used to collect any new
examples from the Steelscript packages after the creation of the workspace.
There are a number of workspace options available::

   $ steel mkworkspace -h
   Usage: steel mkworkspace [options]

     Create new workspace for running and creating Steelscript scripts
   
    Options:
      --version          show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit

      Make workspace options:
        -d DIR, --dir=DIR  Optional path for new workspace location
        --git              Initialize project as new git repo

``steel uninstall``
-------------------

The ``uninstall`` subcommand is used to remove all steelscript pacakges.
This can be helpful as a debugging tool in order to quickly uninstall
SteelScript in order to reinstall or upgrade.  This operation will
only affect the steelscript packages themselves, not any of their
installed dependencies (like requests or numpy or pandas).  The available
options are::

    $ steel uninstall -h
    Usage: steel uninstall [options]

      Uninstall all SteelScript packages

    Options:
      --version            show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit

      Package uninstall options:
        --non-interactive  Remove packages without prompting for input



``steel rest``
--------------

The ``rest`` subcommand starts an interactive shell for issuing REST
commands to a target server.  This is best shown by an example by
connecting to the test server at `httpbin.org <http://httpbin.org>`_.  This
freely available test server echos back information sent to it and
provides a nice way to demonstrate the features of the REST shell:

The REST shell support history even across sessions, allowing you to
scroll back through previous commands via up/down arrows and editing.
Use ``Ctrl-R`` to search backword for a command.

Connecting
~~~~~~~~~~

A connection must first be established using the ``connect`` command::

   $ steel rest
   REST Shell ('help' or 'quit' when done)
   Current mode is 'json', use 'mode text' to switch to raw text
   > connect http://httpbin.org/
   http://httpbin.org/>

This creates a Python requests session to the target server.  Basic
authentication is supported by adding ``-u <username> -p <password>``.

The prompt changes to show the server currently used for REST requests.

At any time a connection to a new server may be establshed using
``connect`` and the new server name.

Methods
~~~~~~~

The for basic HTTP methods are supported: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.  Each
method takes the same parameters::

   http://httpbin.org/> GET -h
   Usage: GET <PATH> [options] ...

     Perform an HTTP GET

     Add URL parameters as <param>=<value>.
     Add custom headers as <header>:<value>

   Required Arguments:
     PATH        Full URL path

   Options:
     -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Let's try a simple GET of the path ``/get``.  The full URL will be
the current server plus the absolute path ``http://httpbin.org/get``::

   http://httpbin.org/> GET /get
   Issuing GET
   HTTP Status 200: 406 bytes
   {
       "origin": "208.70.199.4",
       "headers": {
           "X-Request-Id": "860f1a1c-642e-4aef-a673-aad538976475",
           "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
           "Host": "httpbin.org",
           "Accept": "application/json",
           "User-Agent": "python-requests/2.3.0 CPython/2.7.3 Darwin/13.1.0",
           "Connection": "close",
           "Content-Type": "application/json"
       },
       "args": {},
       "url": "http://httpbin.org/get"
   }

Once the REST request is issued, any response from the server is
displayed.  Note that the above response including ``"origin"`` and
``"headers"`` is in the body of the response from httpbin.org_ -- this
server echos back information about the request in response to support
testing.  So the ``"headers"`` shows the request headers that were
automatically added to the outgoing request type.

Notice that the content-type is application/json -- this is the default
encoding for outgoing requests.  This applies primarily to PUT and POST
which will prompt for a BODY::

   http://httpbin.org/> POST /post
   Provide body text, enter "." on a line by itself to finish
   Request must be JSON, use double quotes for strings
   {
     "first": "Chris",
     "last": "White"
   }
   .

The after entering that last line with a period "." by it self, the
REST shell issues the POST request and displays the response from the
server::

   Issuing POST
   HTTP Status 200: 586 bytes
   {
       "files": {},
       "origin": "208.70.199.4",
       "form": {},
       "url": "http://httpbin.org/post",
       "args": {},
       "headers": {
           "Content-Length": "35",
           "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
           "X-Request-Id": "36067711-b9a9-47b6-9f65-60202a1dffe7",
           "Host": "httpbin.org",
           "Accept": "application/json",
           "User-Agent": "python-requests/2.3.0 CPython/2.7.3 Darwin/13.1.0",
           "Connection": "close",
           "Content-Type": "application/json"
       },
       "json": {
           "last": "White",
           "first": "Chris"
       },
       "data": "{\"last\": \"White\", \"first\": \"Chris\"}"
   }


URL Parameters and Custom Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All methods support adding URL parameters and custom headers
on the same line as the method::

   http://httpbin.org/> GET /get x=1 y=2 X-Hdr:foo Y-Hdr:bar

The above will encode two URL parameters ``x`` and ``y`` and
will add two custom HTTP headers ``X-Hdr`` and ``Y-Hdr``.

JSON vs Text modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the PUT/POST body is expected to be a JSON value.
If the target server instead requires raw text, this can be changed
by the ``mode`` command::

   http://httpbin.org/> POST /post
   Provide body text, enter "." on a line by itself to finish
   Any value allowed
   Here! Here!
   .
   Issuing POST
   HTTP Status 200: 475 bytes
   {
       "files": {},
       "origin": "208.70.199.4",
       "form": {},
       "url": "http://httpbin.org/post",
       "args": {},
       "headers": {
           "Content-Length": "29",
           "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
           "X-Request-Id": "6d2076cc-0213-4d74-84fd-24e6c8a37112",
           "Host": "httpbin.org",
           "Accept": "*/*",
           "User-Agent": "python-requests/2.3.0 CPython/2.7.3 Darwin/13.1.0",
           "Connection": "close"
       },
       "json": null,
       "data": "Any value allowed\nHere! Here!"
   }

REST Logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often it is useful to see the full details of each REST request and
response.  This is achieved using ``--rest-debug=<num>`` and
``--rest-body-lines=<num>``.

As a simple example, here's the full tracing for ``POST /post`` above
with full logging enabled::

    $ steel rest --logfile - --rest-debug=2 --rest-body-lines=10000

    Request must be JSON, use double quotes for strings
    {

        "first": "Chris"
    }
    .
