Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        SimpleLayout provides an intuitive way of adding and arranging the different
        elements of a page such as paragraphs, images, files and links using
        drag-and-drop functionality.
        These elements are implemented as addable and easily arrangeable "blocks".
        Because of the restricted dimensions of text, images and other content elements,
        the general result is content with a uniform look and feel throughout the site.
        
        .. WARNING::
        
          ``simplelayout.base >= 4.0`` does no longer include and install the old
          simplelayout types. If you still use them, also install
          `simplelayout.types.common`_.
          But we encourage you the newer implementation in `ftw.contentpage`_!
        
        
        Installing simplelayout
        =======================
        
        **New ftw.contentpage implementation**
        
        The package ``simplelayout.base`` nowadays does no longer contain the content
        type implementation. We encourage you to install `ftw.contentpage`_, which
        bases on ``simlelayout.base`` and provides a simplelayout content page type
        and the necessary block types.
        
        Please follow the installation instructions in the
        `readme of ftw.contentpage <https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.contentpage#installing>`_.
        
        
        **Old simplelayout types**
        
        If you, however, want to install the old simplelayout types, you may want to
        install `simplelayout.types.common`_.
        
        You need to install both, ``simplelayout.base`` and ``simplelayout.types.common``::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                simplelayout.base
                simplelayout.types.common
        
        And install ``simplelayout.base`` and ``simplelayout.types.common`` generic
        setup profiles.
        
        
        
        How to use SimpleLayout
        =======================
        
        Check out our video section on plone.org:
        http://plone.org/products/simplelayout.base/documentation
        
        1.) Add a new Page from the "Add new" dropdown.
        
        In this page one can now add the following page elements:
        
        - File
        - Image
        - Link
        - Page
        - Paragraph
        
        2.) Add a new Paragraph from the "Add new" dropdown:
        
        - Provide a title for the new paragraph (not required) and check "Show Title"
          to determine whether the paragraph title will appear in the page's body text.
        - Provide body text for the paragraph.(Of course one could use this first
          paragraph to provide the text for the whole page, but that would defeat the
          purpose of having easily arrangeable "blocks" of text and other page elements)
        
        Image tab:
        
        - Browse for an image and provide a caption and alternative text.
        - Determine whether the image is "clickable", i.e. whether the image source can
          be opened in a new tab. If collective.greybox is installed, it will use
          greybox to show the image.
        
        Settings tab:
        
        - Provide keywords/tags for categorization purposes.
        - Specify "Related Items": If the "teaser" box is checked, related items of this
          paragraph will be displayed underneath the paragraph.
        - Provide "Creators" (Persons responsible for creating the content of this item).
        - Allow comments.
        - Determine whether this paragraph should be included in the site navigation
          (by default it is not included).
        
        When saving the paragraph, one is redirected to the edit tab of the parent page.
        Here one is presented with the option of editing the page as a whole, or editing
        one of the sub-elements of the page.
        The layout of the recently added paragraph can be further manipulated using the
        layout icons in the top panel of the that paragraph.
        The paragraph can also easily be deleted from here, or its order in the page
        changed using the "ordering" arrow icons in its top panel (will be removed,
        you should use the drag'n'drop funtionality).
        
        3.) Add an Image to the page from the "Add new" dropdown:
        
        - Browse for an image and provide alternative text. The Title is used as the
          image caption.
        
        4.) Add a File to the page from the "Add new" dropdown:
        
        - Browse for and add a file (for example a pdf). The file download link will be
          displayed in the page content.
        
        5.) Add a Link to the page from the "Add new" dropdown:
        
        - Specify an external link, which will be displayed in the page.
        
        6.) Add another page:
        The parent page acts as a container in which sub pages can be added.
        These will appear in the site navigation.
        
        
        Page Layout:
        ------------
        
        To add layout functionality to the page as a whole, go to
        "Site Setup" => "Simplelayout Configuration", and check "Show Design".
        A "Design" dropdown will be added to your SimpleLayout pages, from which you can
        choose one of 3 possible layouts: Normal, Two Columns, Two Columns One on Top
        Here one can also determine the dimensions of the layout columns by providing pixel
        values in the other 2 "configuration" tabs.
        
        Go to the edit tab of your SimpleLayout page and choose another layout from the
        "Design" dropdown.
        
        In "Two Columns" designs it's possible to align the blocks like a table.
        Use the "align to grid" link in the top panel of the page.
        
        Drag and drop functionality:
        ----------------------------
        Drag the existing content blocks into the other areas of the newly created layout,
        by clicking on the top panel and dragging the block to the desired position.
        
        
        Support of following products is allready included
        --------------------------------------------------
        
        * collective.greybox
        * Products.PloneFlashUpload

        FAQ
        ===
        
        This FAQ provides some technical information/answers.
        
        :Q: After reinstall I lose my configlet configuration?
        
        :A: Do not reinstall simplelayout.base using QI, but rather use portal_setup import steps.
            Because the configlet data is stored in a local utility, in the event of a
            reinstallation the utility will be removed (all data is gone) and added
            again with default values. The following example shows how to change
            the sl configlet default values with setuphandlers in a policy package.
        
            imports::
        
              from zope.component import getUtility
              from simplelayout.base.configlet.interfaces import ISimplelayoutConfiguration
        
            config.py::
        
              SL_CONFIGURATION = {'show_design_tab' : True,
                                  'small_size' : 145,
                                  'middle_size' : 302,
                                  'full_size' : 614,
                                  'small_size_two' : 66,
                                  'middle_size_two' : 145,
                                  'full_size_two' : 300}
        
            method in setuphandlers.py::
        
              def simplelayoutConf(self):
                  sl_conf = getUtility(ISimplelayoutConfiguration, name='sl-config')
                  for key in SL_CONFIGURATION:
                      setattr(sl_conf,key,SL_CONFIGURATION[key])
        
        
        :Q: How does simplelayout know which content type is a block?
        :A: Simplelayout marks blockable types with the interface *ISimpleLayoutBlock*
        
        :Q: Can I use simplelayout listings on other content types?
        :A: Of course, just make sure your type provides the ISimpleLayoutCapable
            interface and paste the following code into your template ::
        
              <tal:block content="structure provider:simplelayout.base.listing" />
        
            Make simplelayout blocks addable on your type.
        
        :Q: Can I uninstall simplelayout.base?
        :A: As many new packages based on component architecture, not yet...
        
        :Q: How can I add a new image scale?
        :A: ...
        
        :Q: How can i remove them?
        :A: Navigate to portla_types/blocktype in the ZMI, select "actions" and
            remove the image scale from actions list.
        
        :Q: I have a content type which I want to use it as block in simplelayout?
        :A: Just register a BrowserView named block_view for the specific content type,
            then z3c knows what to do. Example in simplelayout.types.common:
        
            configure.zcml::
        
              <browser:page
                for="Products.ATContentTypes.interface.file.IATFile"
                name="block_view"
                template="file.pt"
                class=".views.FileView"
                permission="zope2.View" />
        
        :Q: I would like to create my own design template?
        :A: ...
        
        :Q: Is there a possibility for blocks to show up as a portlet?
        :A: This feature is under development and will be released soon.
        
        :Q: How do you know in multible column designs, where to show up the blocks?
        :A: Blocks has two additional interfaces: a slot interface and a column
            interface. The slot interface tells the block where he should appear.
            The column interface desides the image scale.
        
        :Q: My images will be resized by CSS?
        :A: Tick the box "Set simplelayout scales as image scales", restart zope an "recalc images".
            Don't use atct_tool for this action, because it will ignore paragraphs.
        
        :Q: Is it possible to use more than one block_view per type?
        :A: Yes, in the 2.0 release of simplelayout.base its possible to define your own view
            for a blockable type, you have to customize the actions and the action-icons of your
            content type. the action id should look like the following example
            id: sl-dummyscale-dummycssklass-myview
            sl- = simplelayout prefix for actions
            dummyscale = the image scale, possible values are small, half or full
            dummycssklass = an additional css wrapper class
            myview = your view must be registered as block_view-myview
        
            If yout don't need a scale or additional css class, please fill in some
            dummy values as in the example above, Otherwise your view will have the
            wrong name.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * TESTS
        * mess up JS
        * fix block height, if moving blocks from two to one column.
        * send feedback if ajax request fails
