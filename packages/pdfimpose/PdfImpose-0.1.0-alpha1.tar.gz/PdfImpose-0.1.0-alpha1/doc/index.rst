Welcome to `PdfImpose`'s documentation!
=======================================

`PdfImpose` is a library and a command line program to impose a Pdf document.
According to `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imposition>`_,
"imposition consists in the arrangement of the printed product's pages on the
printer's sheet, in order to obtain faster printing, simplify binding and
reduce paper waste".

I am far from being the first person to implement such an algorithm. I am fond
of everything about pre-computer-era printing (roughly, from Gutemberg to the
Linotype). Being also a geek, I wondered how to compute how the pages would be
arranged on the printer's sheet, and here is the result.

Some (free) other implementation of imposition are:

- Scribus have `a list <http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/PDF,_PostScript_and_Imposition_tools>`_ of some of those tools
- `BookletImposer <http://kjo.herbesfolles.org/bookletimposer/>`_
- `Impose <http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/Tools/pdf/Impose.html>`_
