Changes
=======

0.7.1 (2015-01-28)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fix faulty release 0.7.0.


0.7.0 (2015-01-28)
++++++++++++++++++

- An error message is correctly logged when the worker produces an exception
  which cannot be represented in us-ascii. This used to cause an exception in
  the logging module. The cause of those exceptions where quite hard to track.

- Removed dependency on zope.app.security which was neither declared nor
  necessary.

- Moved project home to <https://bitbucket.org/gocept/gocept.runner/>.


0.6.0 (2011-12-01)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added transaction_per_item decorator.
- Use stdlib's doctest instead of zope.testing.


0.5.3 (2010-04-14)
++++++++++++++++++

- Use log.error/log.warning instead of log.exception. Conflict errors are
  logged as warning now, because they are not really a problem.

0.5.2 (2010-04-14)
++++++++++++++++++

- Convert logged exceptions to str.


0.5.1 (2009-10-13)
++++++++++++++++++

0.4 (2009-09-03)
