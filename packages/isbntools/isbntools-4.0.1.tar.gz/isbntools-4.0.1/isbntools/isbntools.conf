# In the left side put the name of the plugin and in the right side the name
# of the file that implements the plugin (in this case the file MUST be 
# inside the directory 'isbntools/contrib/plugins').
# 
# In alternative, you can put the file inside any directory you want, but
# you MUST write in the right side the FULL path of the DIRECTORY and the
# file that implements the plugin MUST be named with the pattern 'left_side.py'
# (ex: myplug=/home/me/dev/) for file myplug.py in /home/me/dev/

[MODULES]
# Modules can do whatever you want and can use external libraries. 
# They must be inside ONE directory. 
#
# We can have access to the options set in this section 
# (ex: myoption=myvalue) by myvalue = config.options("MYOPTION")
