# How to Contribute

`isbntools` has a very small code base, so it is a good project to begin your
adventure in open-source... and it is an app, a lib and a framework at the same
time, so you will find plenty of opportunities to contribute.

> **NOTE**: By contributing you agree with the [license terms](LICENSE-LGPL.txt)
  (**LGPL v3**) of the project.


## Main Steps

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
2. Submit a ticket for your issue or idea
   ([help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJlYiMp8FuY)),
   on https://github.com/xlcnd/isbntools/issues,
   (if possible wait for some feedback before any serious commitment... :)
3. **Fork** the repository on GitHub and **clone it locally**
   ([help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)).
4. `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` (at your local directory).
5. Do your code... (**remember the code must run on python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, pypy
   and be OS independent** It is easier if you start to write in python 3 and then
   adapt for python 2) (you will find [Travis](http://bit.ly/travis-isbntools) very handy for
   testing with this requirement!)
6. Write tests for your code using `nose` and put then in the directory `isbntools/test`
7. Pass **all tests** and with **coverage > 90%**.
   Check the coverage in [Coveralls](http://bit.ly/1mWwjuE) or locally with the command
   `nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=isbntools`.
8. **Check if all requirements are fulfilled**!
9. **Push** you local changes to GitHub and make there a **pull request**
   ([help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/))
   **using `dev` as base branch** (by the way, we follow the *fork & pull* model with this small change).

> **NOTE**: *Travis*, *coverage*, *flake8* and  *pylint*, have already
configuration files adapted to the project.

## Style

Your code **must** be PEP8 compliant and be concise as possible (check it with
`flake8` and `pylint`).

Use doc strings for the users and comments (few) as signposts
for fellow developers. Make your code as clear as possible.


## Red Lines

**Don't submit pull requests that are only comments to the code that is
already in the repo!**
Don't expect kindness if you do that.
You **can** comment and give suggestions on the code at
[issues](http://bit.ly/1i8vmhB) page.

**No** doc tests! Remember point 6 above.

**Don't** submit pull requests without checking point 8!



## Suggestions

Read the [dev notes](http://isbntools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/devs.html) in the documentation.

Goto [issues/enhancement](http://bit.ly/1mctuZk) for possible enhancements to the code.
If you have some idea that is not there enter your own.
Select some focused issue and enter some comments on how you plan to tackle it.

See if your code can be written as a *pluggin* (a new metadata provider) or as
a *user script* [they are easier!].

For contributions to the core, you cannot use external libraries (except standard lib),
and must be pure python. There is another package `isbntools.contrib` where these requirements
are not applied (new repo comming soon!).

## Important

If you don't have experience with these issues, don't be put off by these requirements,
see them as a learning opportunity. Thanks!
