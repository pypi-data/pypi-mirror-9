This directory contains small example programs showing some uses of PyCIFRW.  Of interest:

validate_cif.py    Validate against DDL1/DDL2 dictionaries.  For example:
     
  python validate_cif.py ../drel/testing/data/nacltest.cif -c -n cif_core.dic -u 2.3.1

will validate nacltest.cif using the information in cif_core.dic as distributed by the
IUCr ftp site. 


loop_example.py    Small program demonstrating how to pick particular columns from a loop
