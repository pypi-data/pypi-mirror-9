<p>MapIt is a service that maps {% if postcodes_available %}postcodes and {% endif %}
geographical points to administrative areas. It&rsquo;s useful for anyone who
has the co-ordinates of a particular point, and needs to find out what regions
it lies within. It&rsquo;s also great for looking up the shapes of all those
boundaries.</p>
