{% load url from compat %}
<dt>Example:</dt>
<dd>
    <p>If your postcode was <em>0373</em> you would load
        <a href="{% url "mapit_index" %}postcode/0373">/postcode/0373</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        By default the response is in JSON, if you want a human readable page then append ‘<em>.html</em>’ to the url
        <a href="{% url "mapit_index" %}postcode/0373.html">/postcode/0373.html</a>
    </p>
</dd>
