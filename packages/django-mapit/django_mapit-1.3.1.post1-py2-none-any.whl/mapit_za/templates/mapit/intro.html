<p>MapIt is a service that maps geographical points to
administrative areas. It&rsquo;s useful for anyone who has
co-ordinates of a point in South Africa, and needs to find out what
Ward, Municipality and Province it lies within. It&rsquo;s also great for
looking up the shapes of all those boundaries.</p>
