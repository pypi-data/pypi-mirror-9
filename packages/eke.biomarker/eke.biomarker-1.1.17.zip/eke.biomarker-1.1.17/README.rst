This product, ``eke.biomarker``, provides display and RDF_ ingest of the
biomarkers being studied by the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN_).
Biomarkers are chemical indicators for disease, and in the case of EDRN, the
disease being pursued is cancer.  This package lets a researcher browse,
search for, and discover interesting biomarkers, determine how research
progress is being made, find out statistical values of the biomarkers, and so
forth.  These features are integral to the EDRN Knowledge Environment (EKE_).
EDRN uses the EKE to make it easy to discover, share, search for, and retrieve
all of EDRN's collective knowledge, including cancers and other diseases,
protocols, specimens, participants, staff, and |---| as in the case of this
product |---| biomarkers.

Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any
Plone_ compatible site.

This software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,
operated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.
