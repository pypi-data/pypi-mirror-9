1.1.0 — Strong Simplification
-----------------------------

This release simplifies specimens so that only the common attributes between
Specimen Reference Sets, PRoBE, and ERNE Specimens are represented.

 
1.0.1 — Upgrade Cleanup
-----------------------

This release updates the GenericSetup profile to 4, provides upgrade steps to
that profile, and makes the testing and development harness depend on "trunk"
level of other eggs instead of on released versions of those eggs.  It also
takes advantage of factored out common testing setup.


1.0.0 — Plone 4
---------------

This release makes eke.specimens compatible with Plone 4.


0.0.3 — NYU
-----------

This release tackles the following:

* If an ERNE site is down and the ERNE cache returns an HTTP 500 error, don't
  abort the entire ingest.  Just skip that site and go forward.  "Keep calm
  and carry on."


0.0.2 — A Mixed Bag
-------------------

This release addresses the following issue:

* CA-698 - "Structural" objects appear in searches


0.0.1 — Goodbye, Peter Lin
--------------------------

This time around, the EKE specimen package provides direct display of ERNE
specimen data without having to delegate to the ERNE UI web application.
(There is no corresponding issue in the issue tracker for this new feature; or
if there is, the issue tracker is down as I write this and can't confirm.)

This release also addresses the following issues:

* CA-683 — Counts are off on specimen search
* CA-685 — Specimen Tab search results returns records for the same search
  summary more than one time (should be grouped together)

0.0.0 — Unreleased
------------------

Initial release into beta.
