Description: *************
        eke.specimens
        *************
        
        This product, ``eke.specimens``, provides display and RDF_ ingest of
        ERNE (EDRN Resource Network Exchange) specimens for the Early Detection
        Research Network (EDRN_) Knowledge Environment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to
        make it easy to discover, share, search for, and retrieve all of EDRN's
        collective knowledge, including cancers and other diseases, biomarkers,
        publications, investigators, participants, studies, protocols, and, as in the
        case of this product, specimens.
        
        Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any
        Plone_ compatible site.
        
        This software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,
        operated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.
        
        • Add ``eke.specimens`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
         
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                eke.specimens
                
        • Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
          
            % ./bin/buildout
                
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.

        1.1.2 — Dawn's Out, William's In
        --------------------------------
        
        This release handles:
        
        * CA-832 - Correct NYU Specimen Site, PI and Organ
        
        
        1.1.1 — Thus Spake Christos
        ---------------------------
        
        This release addresses the following:

        * CA-825 - Evening telecon
        
        
        1.1.0 — Strong Simplification
        -----------------------------
        
        This release simplifies specimens so that only the common attributes between
        Specimen Reference Sets, PRoBE, and ERNE Specimens are represented.
        
         
        1.0.1 — Upgrade Cleanup
        -----------------------
        
        This release updates the GenericSetup profile to 4, provides upgrade steps to
        that profile, and makes the testing and development harness depend on "trunk"
        level of other eggs instead of on released versions of those eggs.  It also
        takes advantage of factored out common testing setup.
        
        
        1.0.0 — Plone 4
        ---------------
        
        This release makes eke.specimens compatible with Plone 4.
        
        
        0.0.3 — NYU
        -----------
        
        This release tackles the following:
        
        * If an ERNE site is down and the ERNE cache returns an HTTP 500 error, don't
          abort the entire ingest.  Just skip that site and go forward.  "Keep calm
          and carry on."
        
        
        0.0.2 — A Mixed Bag
        -------------------
        
        This release addresses the following issue:
        
        * CA-698 - "Structural" objects appear in searches
        
        
        0.0.1 — Goodbye, Peter Lin
        --------------------------
        
        This time around, the EKE specimen package provides direct display of ERNE
        specimen data without having to delegate to the ERNE UI web application.
        (There is no corresponding issue in the issue tracker for this new feature; or
        if there is, the issue tracker is down as I write this and can't confirm.)
        
        This release also addresses the following issues:
        
        * CA-683 — Counts are off on specimen search
        * CA-685 — Specimen Tab search results returns records for the same search
          summary more than one time (should be grouped together)
        
        0.0.0 — Unreleased
        ------------------
        
        Initial release into beta.
