This product, ``eke.specimens``, provides display and RDF_ ingest of
ERNE (EDRN Resource Network Exchange) specimens for the Early Detection
Research Network (EDRN_) Knowledge Environment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to
make it easy to discover, share, search for, and retrieve all of EDRN's
collective knowledge, including cancers and other diseases, biomarkers,
publications, investigators, participants, studies, protocols, and, as in the
case of this product, specimens.

Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any
Plone_ compatible site.

This software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,
operated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.
