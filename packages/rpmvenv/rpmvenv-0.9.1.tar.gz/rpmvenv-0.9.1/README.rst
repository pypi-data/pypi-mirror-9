rpmvenv
=======

*RPM package helper which support packaging Python virtual environments.*

Basic Usage
===========

In order to package a Python project in an RPM containing a virtualenv drop
a file in your repository root with a '.json' extensions and the following
content. Change the values where appropriate.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "extensions": {
            "enabled": [
                "python_venv",
                "blocks"
            ]
        },
        "core": {
            "group": "Application/System",
            "license": "MIT",
            "name": "some-rpm-package-name",
            "summary": "short package summary",
            "version": "1.2.3"
        },
        "python_venv": {
            "name": "name_of_venv_dir_to_create",
            "path": "/path/where/to/install/venv"
        },
        "blocks": {
            "desc": [
                "some long package description",
                "each array element is a new line"
            ]
        }
    }

Make sure `rpmbuild <http://www.rpm.org>`_ is installed.
With the configuration file in place run the command line tool installed with
the package to generate the RPM.

.. code-block:: shell

    rpmvenv path/to/the/config.json

This will generate a new RPM and place it in your current working directory.

Customizing
===========

While the above example will generate an installable RPM it has limitations.
For example, it does not set the user/group ownership of the packaged files,
it does not include non-Python files such as init scripts, and it does not
perform any post install actions. This project uses a plugin system for adding
and enabling extra functionality. For convenience, some features ship with the
project already.

Core
----

The 'core' extension is always enabled. This extension provides the options
for interacting with all the required RPM SPEC file tags like "Version" or
"Url". Current core options:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {"core":{
        // The name of the RPM file which is generated.
        "name": "some-pkg-name",
        // The RPM version to build.
        "version": "1.2.3",
        // The release number for the RPM. Default is 1.
        "release": "1",
        // The short package summary.
        "summary": "a package for code",
        // The RPM package group in which this package belongs.
        "group": "Application/System",
        // The license under which the package is distributed.
        "license": "MIT",
        // The URL of the package source.
        "url": "https://projectsite.com",
        // The path to the package source. Defaults to the parent of the config.
        "source": "/path/to/my/source",
        // The name of the buildroot directory to use. Default is random temp dir.
        "buildroot": "%(mktemp -ud %{_tmppath}/%{SOURCE0}-%{version}-%{release}-XXXXXX)",
    }}

Blocks
------

RPM files contain several sections, or blocks, which can contain multi-line
content. Most blocks contain shell code used to build and install a project.
This extension is enabled by adding 'blocks' to the list of enabled extensions.
Each block configuration item is a list of strings. Each string represents a
line in the body of the block.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {"blocks" {
        // Shell to execute on post-install.
        "post": [],
        // Shell to execute on post-uninstall.
        "postun": [],
        // Shell to execute on pre-install.
        "pre": [],
        // Shell to execute on pre-uninstall.
        "preun": [],
        // Shell to execute during the prep phase.
        "prep": [],
        // Shell to execute during the build phase.
        "build": [],
        // Shell to execute during the install phase.
        "install": [],
        // Shell to execute during the clean phase.
        "clean": [],
        // Long form description of the package.
        "desc": [],
        // A list of files which are included in the package.
        "files": [],
    }}

File Permissions
----------------

This extension will set the user and group ownership properties of all files
included with the package. It is enabled by adding 'file_permissions' to the
list of enabled extensions.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {"file_permissions": {
        // The name of the user who should own the files.
        "user": "webserver",
        // The name of the group which should own the files.
        "group": "webserver",
        // If true, the user will be created during install if missing.
        "create_user": false,
        // If true, the group will be created during install if missing.
        "create_group": false,
    }}

Additional Files
----------------

This extension will allow for packaging any files even if they are not a part
of the built project. This extension is enabled by adding "file_extras" in the
list of enabled extensions. This extension also requires that
'file_permissions' be enabled. It uses the same user and group to assign
ownership of the extra files.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {"file_extras": {
        // A list of source:destination pairs relative to the root.
        "files": [
            'somedir/project_init_script:etc/init.d/project'
        ]
    }}

Python Virtualenv
-----------------

This extension automates generating an RPM from a Python virtualenv. It is
enabled by adding 'python_venv' to the list of enabled extensions.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {"python_venv": {
        // The executable to use for creating a venv.
        "cmd": "virtualenv",
        // Flags to pass to the venv during creation.
        "flags": ["--always-copy"],
        // The name of the installed venv.
        "name": "project_venv",
        // The path in which to install the venv.
        "path": "/usr/share/python",
        // The python executable to use in the venv.
        "python": "python2.7",
        // Names of requirements files to install in the venv.
        "requirements": ["requirements.txt"],
        // Flags to pass to pip during pip install calls.
        "pip_flags": "--index-url https://internal-pypi-server.org",
    }}

CLI Flags And Environment Variables
-----------------------------------

In addition to adding the above sections to a configuration file, all values
may also be given as command line flags to the 'rpmvenv' command as well as
environment variables.

Command line flags follow a common pattern: '--extension_name_option_name'. A
common use for this feature is setting the RPM package version over the CLI
rather than hard coding it into a configuration file.

.. code-block:: shell

    rpmvenv /path/to/some/config.json --core_version="$(date -u +%Y.%m.%d.%H.%M.%S)"

This CLI argument pattern may be used to set any options. Alternatively,
environment variables can also be set using a similar naming scheme:
'export RPMVENV_EXTENSION_NAME_OPTION_NAME=""'. Setting the version with
environment variables, for example:

.. code-block:: shell

    RPMVENV_CORE_VERSION="$(date -u +%Y.%m.%d.%H.%M.%S)" \
    rpmvenv /path/to/some/config.json

The precedence order for options is configuration file, environment variables,
then CLI flags. That is, environment variables will always override items in
the configuration file and CLI flags will override both the file and the
environment variables.

Additional Options
------------------

In addition to the options for modifying the spec file, the following are also
available as CLI flags:

-   --source

    The path to a Python source repository. By default, this value resolves to
    the directory containing the specified configuration file. It can be
    overridden if the Python source is not adjacent the configuration file.

-   --destination

    The directory in which to place the RPM. The default value is the current
    working directory.

-   --spec

    This flag disables the actual build in favour of printing the spec file
    contents to stdout. Use this option if you need to manually verify the
    spec file before running a build.

-   --verbose

    Normally, the stdout and stderr of the rpmbuild call are captured unless
    there is an exception. Adding this flag enables the real-time output from
    the rpmbuild command.

Testing
=======

The included tests are written using py.test. There is also an included tox.ini
which is configured to run the tests in addition to style checks. By default,
the integration tests run using rpmvenv as the target project to build.
However, any project with a requirements.txt file in the repository root can
be specified with the '--python-git-url' flag while running the tests.
