Description: Physical Optics Propagation in PYthon (POPPY)
        
        
        POPPY is a Python package that simulates physical optical propagation including diffraction. 
        It implements a flexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction
        and point spread function formation, particularly in the context of astronomical telescopes.
        POPPY was developed as part of a simulation package for JWST, but is more broadly applicable to many kinds of 
        imaging simulations. 
        
        Developed by Marshall Perrin at STScI, 2010-2014, for use simulating the James Webb Space Telescope.
