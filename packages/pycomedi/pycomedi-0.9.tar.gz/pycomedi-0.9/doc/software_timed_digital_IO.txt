Import required modules.

>>> from pycomedi.device import Device
>>> from pycomedi.channel import DigitalChannel
>>> from pycomedi.constant import SUBDEVICE_TYPE, IO_DIRECTION

Open a device.

>>> device = Device('/dev/comedi0')
>>> device.open()

Get your DIO subdevice (alternatively, use `device.subdevice()` to
select the subdevice directly by index).

>>> subdevice = device.find_subdevice_by_type(SUBDEVICE_TYPE.dio)

Generate a list of channels you wish to control.

>>> channels = [subdevice.channel(i, factory=DigitalChannel)
...             for i in (0, 1, 2, 3)]

Configure the channels.

>>> for chan in channels:
...     chan.dio_config(IO_DIRECTION.input)

Read/write either as a block...

>>> value = subdevice.dio_bitfield(base_channel=0)
>>> value  # doctest: +SKIP
255L

... or sequentially.

>>> value = [c.dio_read() for c in channels]
>>> value  # doctest: +SKIP
[1, 1, 1, 1]

Close the device when you're done.

>>> device.close()
