HTTReplay is a Python HTTP (and HTTPS!) replay library for testing.

The library supports the recording and replay of network requests made via ``httplib``, ``requests >= 1.2.3`` (including ``requests 2.x``), and ``urllib3 >= 0.6``.

Here's a very simple example of how to use it:

::

    import requests
    from httreplay import replay

    with replay('/tmp/recording_file.json'):
        result = requests.get("http://example.com/")
        # ... issue as many requests as you like ...
        # ... repeated requests won't hit the network ...

There's a lot more you can do. Full documentation is available from the `httreplay github page <https://github.com/davepeck/httreplay>`_.
