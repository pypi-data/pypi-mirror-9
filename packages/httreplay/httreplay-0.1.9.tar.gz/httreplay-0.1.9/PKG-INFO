Description: 
        JANUARY 2015 :: HTTREPLAY IS NOW END-OF-LIFED. I strongly recommend using ``vcr.py``, which these days has a larger community, a richer feature set, and is better maintained. I will keep HTTReplay on PyPi for now just so that nobody gets caught out. But please do migrate to ``vcr.py`` when you have an opporunity. Thanks!
        
        HTTReplay is a Python HTTP (and HTTPS!) replay library for testing.
        
        The library supports the recording and replay of network requests made via ``httplib``, ``requests >= 1.2.3`` (including ``requests 2.x``), and ``urllib3 >= 0.6``.
        
        Here's a very simple example of how to use it:
        
        ::
        
            import requests
            from httreplay import replay
        
            with replay('/tmp/recording_file.json'):
                result = requests.get("http://example.com/")
                # ... issue as many requests as you like ...
                # ... repeated requests won't hit the network ...
        
        There's a lot more you can do. Full documentation is available from the `httreplay github page <https://github.com/davepeck/httreplay>`_.
