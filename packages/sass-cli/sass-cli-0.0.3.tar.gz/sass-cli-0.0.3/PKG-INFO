        ########
        
            I don't want to install Ruby, but I want to compile ``*.scss`` from the
            command line.
        
        Same here.
        
        If you use the Ruby CLI, you will find some things missing. This command
        accepts two arguments, which may either be a pair of filenames or a pair of
        directory names.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Two files:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ sass assets/scss/file.scss build/output.css
        
        
        Two dirs:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ sass assets/scss build/css
        
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/bmcorser/sass-cli.svg
