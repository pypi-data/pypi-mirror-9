Installing proteus
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python 2.7 or later (http://www.python.org/)
 * python-dateutil (http://labix.org/python-dateutil)
 * Optional: trytond (http://www.tryton.org/)
 * Optional: simplejson (http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson)
 * Optional: cdecimal (http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal/index.html)

Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked the proteus source release, enter the
directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

    python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install module to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:
