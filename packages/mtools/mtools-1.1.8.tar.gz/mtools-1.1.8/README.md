What's in the box?
------------------

The following tools are in the mtools collection:

[mlogfilter](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mlogfilter) <br>
slices log files by time, merges log files, filters slow queries, finds table scans, shortens log lines, filters by other atributes, convert to JSON

[mloginfo](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mloginfo) <br>
returns info about log file, like start and end time, version, binary, special sections like restarts, connections, distinct view

[mplotqueries](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mplotqueries) <br>
visualize logfiles with different types of plots (requires matplotlib)

[mlogvis](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mlogvis) <br>
creates a self-contained html file that shows an interactive visualization in a web browser (as an alternative to mplotqueries)

[mlaunch](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mlaunch) <br>
a script to quickly spin up local test environments, including replica sets and sharded systems (requires pymongo)


[mgenerate](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mgenerate) <br>
generates structured pseudo-random data based on a template for testing and reproduction


You can find the manual and many usage examples on the [mtools wiki pages](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki).
