Entity management
=================

Entities are the main content of the site. Each entity consists of a name,
an associated domain, and the XML that describe its metadata. The name is a
non empty string that cannot contain the following characters: ``!``, ``\``,
``:``, ``&`` or ``|``. The metadata must be valid XML conforming to the set
of validators that are configured in this site.

In the home page of the site there is a link at the bottom, labelled *Full
list of entities*, that takes the user to a paginated list of all entities,
regardless of their owners. In this page the user can add a new entity, if
she follows the link labelled *Add entity*. In the form presented thereafter
she will only have to provide a name for the new entity and select a domain
from the set of domains she owns. The user can also adds an enttiy from her
profile page since there is another *Add entity* link there. From the list
of entities a user can also click on an entity to view its details. If she
she is visiting the site as an authenticated user, in this entity detail
page she will be presented with a menu that allows her to manage the entity.
This menu presents the following links:

* **Details**: The detail page for the entity, the same that is accessed by
  clicking on its name from the listing of all entities. This is considered
  the main view of an entity.
* **Modify**: Change name. This link takes the user to a form to change the
  PEER name for
  the entity.
* **Edit metadata**: This link takes the user to a view that allows her to
  edit the metadata for the entity. There are 3 ways of editing these
  metadata, as we shall see bellow in the section `Metadata edition`_.
* **Remove**: This link is used to completely remove the entity from the
  database. Clicking on it will take the user to a confirmation page, and
  the user confirms this action, the entity will be deleted permanently. A
  warning will be shown since this action can not be undone.
* **Team permissions**: This link takes the user to a view where he can
  create a team of people to manage the entity. She can also assign ownership
  of this entity to another user. Another warning is shown in that case since
  that action can not be undone neither.

* **Metarefresh**: This link is only displayed when an *entity* provides an
  *Entity ID* which is a valid URL. Clicking on this link will take the user to
  a page where she can select the frequency to check and update for changes in
  the URL of the entity ID. The frequency options are *Never*, *Daily*, *Weekly*
  and *Monthly*. By default the refresh frequency will be never. If there is any
  problem while refreshing an automatic email will be sent to the owner of the
  identity with the error message.

Metadata edition
----------------

The metadata of an entity consists of an XML document that should conforms to
the `SAML Metadata 2.0 standard
<http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf>`_ .
There are three ways to edit the metadata of an entity. All three of them
are accessible from the *Edit metadata* page for the entity.

* **By text editing**: The user is presented with a text area with the XML
  document, where she can directly edit the XML. This basic text area is
  improved with the SAMLmetaJS plugin to display a tabbed editor in which
  the first tab represents the original textarea but the other tabs can be
  used to edit a specific part of the XML with a more user friendly dedicated
  editor.
* **By uploading a file**: The user is presented with a file input, through
  which she can upload a file with the new XML metadata document.
* **By fetching a remote URL**: If the metadata is published elsewhere in
  the network, the user can use this form to provide the URL of the published
  XML metadata document. The system will download the document pointed at by
  the URL and use it as metadata for the entity.

In the last two cases the user needs to agree with the Terms of Use text by
activating the related checkbox.

When the submit button is clicked a commit dialog pops up with validation
errors or, if everything went well, the differences between this version
and the previous one. If the changes are fine a commit message must be
filled before being able to submit the form. This text will be associated
with the new revision, and used to identify it. If there are errors the error
messages will be displayed in the main page after closing the commit dialog
in order to make it easier to fix these problems.

All the inputs in these forms are required: leaving one of them empty will
trigger a validation error, and the user will be prompted to fill in the
missing value. Additionally, the system will check that the entered metadata
(irrespective of the method used to enter it) is valid according tot the
validators that are configured in this PEER site. If it isn't valid,
the metadata will not be saved and the user will be prompted to enter
correct values, with indications, whenever possible, of the detected errors.

Details view
------------

This is the main page of an entity and it display a lot of information about
the entity.

First it shows the owner, the team and the domain that are associated with
the entity.

Then it display some parts of the XML in a more usable way:

* Entity ID
* Endpoints
* Contact information
* Organization information
* Certificates

After that a **Changes feed** link is displayed with a RSS document
containing the history of the entity.

Finally a **Show history** drop down button is displayed. If the user clicks
on this link, a table with all the revisions made to this entity is shown.
The user can see the contents of the XML for each particular revision by
clicking on the *Id* cell. She can also see the differences between any
revision (but the last) and the previous revision by clicking on the *Diff*
cell.

Entities Feed
-------------

A feed listing the metadata of every entity is available at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/entitiy/rss

It's possible to filter entities by adding xpath expressions to the URL.
Each xpath expression is preceeded with the `xpath` parameter name:

.. code-block:: rest

  http://127.0.0.1:8000/entity/rss?xpath=query1&xpath=query2

The value of each xpath parameter is a xpath expression supported
by ElementTree http://effbot.org/zone/element-xpath.htm

In addition to this API you can also match the text of any node
of the metadata by adding a `=` and the text you are searching to
the end of the xpath expression:

.. code-block:: rest

  http://127.0.0.1:8000/entity/rss?xpath=query1=text1

This means that if a set of nodes matches the `query1` xpath then
the metadata will be a match if any of those nodes has `text1` as
its text contents.

When using multiple xpath parameters they are combined with the
``AND`` boolean operator.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Get all entities with a SingleLogout endpoint

.. code-block:: rest

  http://127.0.0.1:8000/entity/rss?xpath=//md:SingleLogoutService

Get all entities from organization Acme:

.. code-block:: rest

  http://127.0.0.1:8000/entity/rss?xpath=//md:OrganizationName=Acme

Get all entities in the category Research & Scholarship

.. code-block:: rest

  http://127.0.0.1:8000/entity/rss?xpath=//Attribute[@Name='http://id.incommon.org/attribute/entity/category']/AttributeValue=http://id.incommon.org/category/research-and-scholarship


Entity Groups
-------------

*Entity groups* allow to group entities by metadata.

To create an entity group by metadata, the user has to navigate to her profile
page. In the menu she would click on *Add entity group*. This link will take the
user to a form where she has to type the name of the group and the query to
select the group. The query syntax is exactly the same as specified in `Entities
Feed`_. Here it's shown the query for all entities which have the tag
``md:SPSSODescriptor``:

.. figure:: _static/entity_groups_add.png


Every entity group created by the user will be listed in the profile view under
*Your entity groups*. From there the entity group can be deleted or edited.
Clicking on the link with the name of the group will take the user to the main
view of entity group, where all the entities in the group will be displayed as
well as providing a link to the correspondent feed for the entity group.
