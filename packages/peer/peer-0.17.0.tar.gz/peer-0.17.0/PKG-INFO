Description: =================================
        Public Endpoint Entities Registry
        =================================
        
        PEER is envisioned as a lightweight, global registrar for SAML Metadata
        representing both SAML and non-SAML endpoints (e.g., OpenID, IMI). It is
        intended as a focused activity to catalyze international use of federated
        identity. The service is not intended to be a replacement for federation
        or inter-federation, but is intended to be a tool supporting such activities.

        0.10.1 (2012-07-29)
        -------------------
        - Fix url hiding by reordering some url definitions.
        - When importing an entity's metadata inside the EntitiesDescriptor tag, strip
          off such tag.
        - Update SAMLmeteaJS to latest version upstream to fix issue #3.
        - Several fixes in the documentation:
        
          - Make the paths more generic and add notes with real paths depending on the
            current version.
          - Add a note about the initial administrator's name.
          - Replace terena.org with example.com in the example configuration.

        0.10.0 (2012-03-28)

          listen for Entity's updates (creations, updates and deletions)
          and send them to a Nagios server.
        - Remove PEER names. If the DisplayName is present it is used as
          the label for the entity. Otherwise, the entity id is used and
          if neither of them exists, the PEER numeric id is used.
        - Improve the usability of the SAMLmetaJS editor by showing
          user errors as soon as possible and asking the user either to
          fix them or to remove the information that is giving trouble.
        - Implement REMOTE_USER authentication with an easy to switch
          settings option. Also document the web server part of the setup.
        - Update djangosaml2 dependency version. This uses newest pysaml2 version.
          As a consequence encrypted assertions and signed response and requests
          work better now. Djangosaml2 0.4.2 also adds logging support.
        
        0.9.0 (2012-03-03)
        ------------------
        - Several changes to the SAMLmetaJS editor:
          - Support for IdP endpoints and certificates.
          - Support for EncryptionMethod in KeyDescriptors
          - Support for MDUI.PrivacyStatementURL and MDUI.InformationURL.
          - Many refactorings to improve code reuse.
          - Merge features from PEER 0.8.0 into SAMLmetaJS master branch.
        - Show IdP information (endpoints and certificates) in the details view.
        - Improve certificate rendering in the details view.
        - Send emails to subscribers of entities when their endpoints are down.
        - Allow to subscribe to entities for updates about their endpoints state.
        - Refactor the views module of the entities application into a package
          which is easier to handle.
        - Several bug fixes:
          - Fix the terms of use file in the metadata upload file form (issue #2).
          - Fix bad use of ugettext_lazy and use ugettext instead.
          - Fix a crash when an entity is new and does not have metadata yet.
          - Fix the way the diff is computed when submitting a change to the
          metadata of an entity.
        
        0.8.0 (2012-01-31)
        ------------------
        - Rich metadata support. Now it is possible to edit the logo and
          geolocalization hint of an entity. This feature is used
          to display richer multimedia information through PEER.
        - Improve the metadata editor with request initiator and
          discovery response endpoint support. Also improve the localization
          plugin and add keywords and logo to the information plugin.
        - Metadata refresh: if the entity id is a URL that points to the
          metadata itself the user can activate a periodic fetch of this
          metadata.
        - Preview before commit: now the editing and commiting flows are
          separated by a modal dialog that ask for the commit message only
          when the changes are ready. In this dialog a diff of the current
          changes is available for easy reviewing.
        - Git repositry co-existence: if there is already a Git repository
          with metadata files it can be reused in PEER by specifing the
          directory that PEER 'owns' inside this repository.
        - Metadata grouping: a user can define an entity group by writing
          a query. A custom feed and map for this group are created
          automatically so following the changes for related entities
          becomes easier.
        - Lots of bug fixes and documentation improvements.
        
        0.7.0 (2011-12-22)
        ------------------
        - DNS-based domain validation
        - Delegated domains: an administrator can validate a domain directly and
          create a team that can manage such domains as if they were the owners.
        - Administration team: an administrator can add (and remove) other users
          to the administrators team giving them full powers in the system.
        - Support for EntityAttributes SAML extension via a SAMLmetaJS new plugin.
        
        0.6.0 (2011-11-30)
        ------------------
        - Attribute based restrictions. This mean, administrators can define
          which metadata attributes can be edited and which ones can't be changed.
        - Attribute based notifications a.k.a. advanced filters in the feeds.
        - Usability improvements by adding several helpful messages to a lot of
          views.
        - Federated authentication.
        - Password reset for those of you with volatile memories.
        - Several bug fixes.

          domain ownership proof.
        - When editing the metadata of an entity, warn the user that there are
          unsaved changes before he navigates to another page.
        - Remove the metadata when removing the entity.
