Branding customization guidelines
=================================

Mision
-------

The look&feel of the PEER website, will be adaptable to differents worldwide
services that will come up.

To assure a global identification underneath to all of the future design
themes, PEER style guidelines are being evolved as a reference point for all
designers creating a PEER website.

There are two main categories in this section: *locked things* and
*customizable things*.

Locked things
-------------
Page layout & content placement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The page width is 1024px but the content is limited to 960px width.
Indeed there's main page division, leaving a 242px right side column in
content block. This right column will appear on multiple site´s views and
will always show content related actions.

An 17px baseline grid is used to help with vertical alignment page
components.

Firm adherence to the baseline isn’t necessary for all typography but it does
help to create vertical rhythm on the page.

Blocks height and width values, on the page layout will be locked for the
future PEER themes.

Customizable things
-------------------
Background colors and images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Header, content and footer background are free to apply any style change on
their background color and image properties.

Actually they could be different from each other, given as a result, a new
creative site look&feel.

Headings, links, and body text styles are wholly free to change in any of
their style properties.

In this guides group must to be mentioned, the home banner, that obviously,
is free to change completly its image and slogan.
