  user errors as soon as possible and asking the user either to

  to display richer multimedia information through PEER.
- Improve the metadata editor with request initiator and
  discovery response endpoint support. Also improve the localization
  plugin and add keywords and logo to the information plugin.
- Metadata refresh: if the entity id is a URL that points to the
  metadata itself the user can activate a periodic fetch of this
  metadata.
- Preview before commit: now the editing and commiting flows are
  separated by a modal dialog that ask for the commit message only
  when the changes are ready. In this dialog a diff of the current
  changes is available for easy reviewing.
- Git repositry co-existence: if there is already a Git repository
  with metadata files it can be reused in PEER by specifing the
  directory that PEER 'owns' inside this repository.

  a query. A custom feed and map for this group are created
  automatically so following the changes for related entities
  becomes easier.
