Description: Varnish buildout recipe
        =======================
        
        This package provides buildout_ recipes for the configuration of varnish.  This
        has a number of features and differences from `plone.recipe.varnish`_, but it
        was inspired by that package.
        
        This version only supports varnish 3.x.
        
        This package also doesn't provide all the features of plone.recipe.varnish,
        since it's designed to be used slightly differently.  Using this recipe you
        have one varnish daemon per deployed backend application server.  If you have
        three different applications on a server, you will run three varnish daemons.
        This means they can be separately deployed, configured and maintained.  This
        also means there is no need for host-header based routing.
        
        Note that this package provides no support for *installing* varnish.  Use the
        binary provided by your OS, or use `zc.recipe.cmmi`_ perhaps.
        
        The key differences are:
        
         1. This packages uses `isotoma.recipe.gocaptain`_ to write the start/stop scripts, so it's more likely to play well with your OS and behaves more normally
         2. Support for a separate logging system with each varnish instance, again using GoCaptain
         3. A different (and arguably more sane) basic varnish configuration
         4. Easy support for custom templates

        Configuration example
        ---------------------
        
        A recipe for this package would look something like::
        
            [varnish]
            recipe = isotoma.recipe.varnish
            name = mysite
            bind = 127.0.0.1:8080
            backends = 127.0.0.1:9000
            varnishlog = /usr/bin/varnishncsa
            logfile = /var/log/varnish/mysite.log
        
        This would create two start scripts in your bin directory: varnish and
        varnishlog.  The log instance will only log activity for this varnish instance.
        
        Mandatory Parameters
        --------------------
        
        bind
            The host:port to listen on
        backends
            A list of backends (note only one backend is currently supported with the default template, because some director code is required.  A custom template should work ok though, if you write one.)
        
        Optional Parameters
        -------------------
        
        name
            This identifies the individual varnish instance - see the -n option to varnishd. (required if you are using varnishlog and recommended even if not)
        cache-size
            The size of the cache.
        connect-timeout
            The .connect_timeout option in the output VCL
        first-byte-timeout
            The .first_byte_timeout option in the output VCL
        between-bytes-timeout
            The .between_bytes_timeout in the output VCL
        daemon
            The path to the varnishd daemon (default /usr/sbin/varnishd)
        parameters
            Any other parameters to pass at runtime (without the -p)
        user
            The user to run the daemon as (default nobody)
        group
            The group to run the daemon as (default nobody)
        verbose-headers
            If you set this, you will get some very useful debugging headers in your HTTP output.
        template
            The path to the template to use, if you wish to provide a different one. It's expected that this will be a Varnish 2.1 template.
            If you try to use Varnish 2.0, isotoma.recipe.varnish will attempt to downgrade the template.
        log-include-regex
            Include lines matching the specified regex in the log output
        log-exclude-regex
            Exclude lines matching the specified regex from the log output
        log-include-tag
            Include lines with the specified tag in the log output
        log-exclude-tag
            Exclude lines with the specified tag from the log output
        logfile
            The path to the logfile to write (required if varnishlog specified)
        varnishlog
            The path to the varnishlog binary - you can use either varnishlog or varnishncsa
        telnet
            Offer a management interface on the specified address and port. (format: address:port)
            Will generate a varnishadm wrapper in bin dir with the -T address:port already provided
        cachehtml
            By default HTML is explicitly excluded from being cached, to avoid various
            broken configurations we've seen. If you really want to cache HTML pages, set
            this to 'on'
