Description: 
        It is impossible to properly install this package in buildout 1.6.x.
        
        This package installs fine with pip.
        
        ::
        
            >>> pip install tompoes
            >>> tom
            setup(script=['bin/tom']) works!
            >>> tom_main
            entry_points console_scripts works!
        
        However it is not possible to properly install it in a buildout.
        
        ::
            >>> python bootstrap.py
            >>> ./bin/buildout -v
            >>> ./bin/tom
            -bash: ./bin/tom: No such file or directory
            >>> ./bin/tom_main
            "entry_points console_scripts works!"
        
            Seems like a problem in buildout.easy_install.
