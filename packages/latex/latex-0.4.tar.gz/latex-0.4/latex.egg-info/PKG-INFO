        =======
        
        Documentation can be found at https://pythonhosted.org/latex .
        
        Allows calling LaTeX from Python without leaving a mess. Similar to the
        (officially obsolete) `tex <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tex/>`_ package, whose
        `successor <http://www.profv.de/texcaller/>`_ is not PyPi-installable:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
             min_latex = (r"\documentclass{article}"
                          r"\begin{document}"
                          r"Hello, world!"
                          r"\end{document}")
        
             from latex.build import build_pdf
        
             # this builds a pdf-file inside a temporary directory
             pdf = build_pdf(min_latex)
        
             # look at the first few bytes of the header
             print pdf[:10]
        
        Also comes with support for using `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ templates
        to generate LaTeX files.
        
        ``make_env`` can be used to create an ``Environment`` that plays well with
        LaTex::
        
           Variables can be used in a LaTeX friendly way: Hello, \VAR{name|e}.
        
           Note that autoescaping is off. Blocks are creating using the block macro:
        
           \BLOCK{if weather is 'good'}
           Hooray.
           \BLOCK{endif}
        
           \#{comments are supported as well}
           %# and so are line comments
        
           To keep things short, line statements can be used:
        
           %- if weather is good
           Yay.
           %- endif
