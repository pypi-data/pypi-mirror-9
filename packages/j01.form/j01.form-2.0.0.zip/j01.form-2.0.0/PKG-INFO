        CHANGES
        =======
        
        2.0.0 (2015-03-17)
        ------------------
        
        - switch to improved j01.jsonrpc implementation and support p01.testbrowser
        
        - feature: added MultiWidget
        
        - changed form and MultiWidget row class to widget-row for better compatibility
          with twitter bootstrap where row is used for the layout grid
        
        - moved j01.form.demo to j01.demo package which provides a full zope server
          setup and some demo pages
        
        
        1.0.1 (2015-01-20)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: implemented form status javascript for show a progress line based on
          filled widgets
        
        - feature: support new browser history api attributes given from j01.jsonrpc
        
        - feature: ensure default form name and id if an empty prefix get used.
          This makes button click handler working with an empty form prefix. Usable for
          simple login form handling.
        
        - bugfix: fix missing updateWidgets call. Only updateWidgets from super class
          was called.
        
        
        1.0.0 (2014-04-04)
        ------------------
        
        - implemented new button concept based on new j01.jsonrpc.btn implementation.
          Use buttons from btn module instead of jsbutton.
        
        
        0.5.1 (2014-03-25)
        ------------------
        
        - removed p01.form configuration
        
        
        0.5.0 (2014-03-25)
        ------------------
        
        - initial release
        
        - enhanced z3c.form widgtes and form classes supporting form-control as input
          css class. The form-control class is used as marker for twitter bootstrap 3
          form fields/controls. This makes it simple to use with twitter bootstrap 3 but
          could also get used with your own css styles. The j01.form package also
          provides a radio/checkbox widget using overlay icons and styles for
          rendering nicer radio and checkbox controls. Other enhanced widgets provide
          nicer select and multi select rendering.
        
        - implemented html5 input widgets
        
        - use new p01.schema package supporting html5 schema fields
