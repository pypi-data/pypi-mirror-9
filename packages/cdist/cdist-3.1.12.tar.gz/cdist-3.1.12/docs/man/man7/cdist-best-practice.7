.SH "NAME"
cdist-best-practice \- Practices used in real environments
.SH "PASSWORDLESS CONNECTIONS"
.sp
It is recommended to run cdist with public key authentication\&. This requires a private/public key pair and the entry "PermitRootLogin without\-password" in the sshd server\&. See sshd_config(5) and ssh\-keygen(1)\&.
.SH "SPEEDING UP SSH CONNECTIONS"
.sp
When connecting to a new host, the initial delay with ssh connections is pretty big\&. You can work around this by "sharing of multiple sessions over a single network connection" (quote from ssh_config(5))\&. The following code is suitable for inclusion into your ~/\&.ssh/config:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Host *
  ControlPath ~/\&.ssh/master\-%l\-%r@%h:%p
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPersist 10
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "SPEEDING UP SHELL EXECUTION"
.sp
On the source host, ensure that /bin/sh is \fBnot\fR bash: bash is quite slow for script execution\&. Instead, you could use dash after installing it:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
ln \-sf /bin/dash /bin/sh
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "MULTI MASTER OR ENVIRONMENT SETUPS"
.sp
If you plan to distribute cdist among servers or use different environments, you can do so easily with the included version control git\&. For instance if you plan to use the typical three environments production, integration and development, you can realise this with git branches:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# Go to cdist checkout
cd /path/to/cdist

# Create branches
git branch development
git branch integration
git branch production

# Make use of a branch, for instance production
git checkout production
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Similar if you want to have cdist checked out at multiple machines, you can clone it multiple times:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
machine\-a % git clone git://your\-git\-server/cdist
machine\-b % git clone git://your\-git\-server/cdist
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "SEPERATING WORK BY GROUPS"
.sp
If you are working with different groups on one cdist\-configuration, you can delegate to other manifests and have the groups edit only their manifests\&. You can use the following snippet in \fBconf/manifests/init\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# Include other groups
sh \-e "$__manifest/systems"

sh \-e "$__manifest/cbrg"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "MAINTAINING MULTIPLE CONFIGURATIONS"
.sp
When you need to manage multiple sites with cdist, like company_a, company_b and private for instance, you can easily use git for this purpose\&. Including a possible common base that is reused accross the different sites:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# create branches
git branch company_a company_b common private

# make stuff for company a
git checkout company_a
# work, commit, etc\&.

# make stuff for company b
git checkout company_b
# work, commit, etc\&.

# make stuff relevant for all sites
git checkout common
# work, commit, etc\&.

# change to private and include latest common stuff
git checkout private
git merge common
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The following \fB\&.git/config\fR is taken from a a real world scenario:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# Track upstream, merge from time to time
[remote "upstream"]
   url = git://git\&.schottelius\&.org/cdist
   fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*

# Same as upstream, but works when being offline
[remote "local"]
   fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/local/*
   url = /home/users/nico/p/cdist

# Remote containing various ETH internal branches
[remote "eth"]
   url = sans\&.ethz\&.ch:/home/services/sans/git/cdist\-eth
   fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/eth/*

# Public remote that contains my private changes to cdist upstream
[remote "nico"]
   url = git\&.schottelius\&.org:/home/services/git/cdist\-nico
   fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/nico/*

# The "nico" branch will be synced with the remote nico, branch master
[branch "nico"]
   remote = nico
   merge = refs/heads/master

# ETH stable contains rock solid configurations used in various places
[branch "eth\-stable"]
   remote = eth
   merge = refs/heads/stable
.fi

Have a look at git\-remote(1) to adjust the remote configuration, which allows
.SH "MULTIPLE DEVELOPERS WITH DIFFERENT TRUST"
.sp
If you are working in an environment that requires different people to work on the same configuration, but having different privileges, you can implement this scenario with a gateway host and sudo:

    \-\-source "$__object/files/basic\&.conf"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "TESTING A NEW TYPE"
.sp
If you want to test a new type on a node, you can tell cdist to only use an object of this type: Use the \fI\-\-initial\-manifest\fR parameter with \- (stdin) as argument and feed object into stdin of cdist:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# Singleton type without parameter
echo __ungleich_munin_server | cdist \-\-initial\-manifest \- munin\&.panter\&.ch

# Singleton type with parameter
echo __ungleich_munin_node \-\-allow 1\&.2\&.3\&.4 | \e
    cdist \-\-initial\-manifest \- rails\-19\&.panter\&.ch

# Normal type
echo __file /tmp/stdintest \-\-mode 0644 | \e
    cdist \-\-initial\-manifest \- cdist\-dev\-01\&.ungleich\&.ch
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "OTHER CONTENT IN CDIST REPOSITORY"
.sp
Usually the cdist repository contains all configuration items\&. Sometimes you may have additional resources that you would like to store in your central configuration repositiory (like password files from KeepassX, Libreoffice diagrams, etc\&.)\&.
.sp
It is recommended to use a subfolder named "non\-cdist" in the repository for such content: It allows you to easily distinguish what is used by cdist and what not and also to store all important files in one repository\&.
