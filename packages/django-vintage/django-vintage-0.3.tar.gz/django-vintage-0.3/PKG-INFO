        Django Vintage
        ==============
        
        The primary goals for Django Vintage are to:
        
        * Archive pages from an old site to make them available
        * Allow pointers to new resources that replace these
        * Keep per-page metadata for search engines
        * Use existing URL structure so redirecting from old site to archive is easy
