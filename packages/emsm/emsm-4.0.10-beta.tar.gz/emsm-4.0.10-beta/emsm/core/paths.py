    Manages the paths to the different files and directories of the
    application.

    The EMSM distinguishes two primary folders:
    The *instance* folder, where the worlds, server, configuration and plugins
    of the user are placed. The *instance* folder can actually be considered to
    be the working directory of the EMSM.
    On the other side is the EMSM installation directory. The *emsm* directory.
    This directory is usually placed in Python's third party library folder
    (site-packages) and contains the EMSM core application and the core plugins.
