        # EMSM
        The **Extendable Minecraft Server Manager** (EMSM) handles
        **multiple minecraft worlds** and **server versions**. The application is
        completely written in Python.
        
        The **EMSM** provides a simple, but sufficient **CLI** (*command line interface*)
        to manage world and server tasks.
        It is based on plugins therefore easily expandable.
        
        The separation of Minecraft worlds and server executables allows to manage
        several different versions of servers (e.g. Vanilla and Bukkit in
        multiple versions) for different worlds. The **EMSM** comes with a backup
        mechanism as one of the core plugins, which can be automated to create
        periodical backups. It also provides a core plugin to check the availability
        of the server and restart them if its configured to do so. Another plugin aims
        at integrating **EMSM** with *init.d* to start/stop the server on
        (re-)boot/shutdown processes.
        
        
        ## Get started
        Please read the [online documentation](http://emsm.readthedocs.org) for
        a full introduction. I tried to keep it simple and short. The EMSM will
        be installed in less than 10 minutes.
        
        When you need help, don't hesitate to create an issue.
