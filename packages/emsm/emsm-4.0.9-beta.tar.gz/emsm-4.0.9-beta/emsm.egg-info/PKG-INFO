        EMSM
        ====
        
        The *Extendable Minecraft Server Manager* (EMSM) handles
        **multiple minecraft worlds** and **server versions**. It is completly written
        in Python and can be easily modified by the user.
        
        The *EMSM* provides a simple, but powerful and extensive command line interface,
        which allows to manage your minecraft server easily and automize tasks.
        
        The separation of minecraft worlds and server executables allows to manage
        several different versions of server (e.g. Vanilla and Bukkit in
        multiple versions) for different worlds. The *EMSM* comes with a backup
        mechanism as one of the core plugins, which can be automated to create
        periodical backups. It also provides a plugin to check the availability
        of the server and restart them, if its configured to do so. Another plugin aims
        at integrating *EMSM* with *init.d* to start/stop the server on
        (re-)boot/shutdown processes.
        
        Get started
        -----------
        
        Please read the `online documentation <http://emsm.readthedocs.org>`_ for
        a full introduction. I tried to keep it simple and short. The EMSM will
        be installed in less than 10 minutes.
        
        When you need help, don't hesitate to create an issue.
