    Sets the *root* :class:`logging.Logger` up.

    The EMSM logger queues all log records until the :file:`emsm.log` can be
    acquired without side effects. This is the case, when the
    :class:`~emsm.core.application.Application` acquired the *file lock*.
    The queued records are then pushed to the :file:`emsm.log`.

    The EMSM logging stategy requires, that each module uses its own
    logger instance:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import logging
        >>> log = logging.getLogger(__file__)
