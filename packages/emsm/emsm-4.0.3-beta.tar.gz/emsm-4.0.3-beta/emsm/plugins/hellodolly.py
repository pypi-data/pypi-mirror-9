About
-----

This plugins works as a tutorial. It's inspired by the wordpress plugin
`Hello Dolly <https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/>`_.

Code and Download
-----------------

You can find the latest version of *hello_dolly* on the EMSM GitHub
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/benediktschmitt/emsm/blob/master/plugins/plugins.py>`_.

..
    By the way, this is a comment block in reST.

    The next line is a little hack. Unfortunetly, sphinx does not find
    "hellodolly.py" when this docstring is included with autodoc. So this does
    not work:

    .. literalinclude:: hellodolly.py

    The next line is actually a small hack. When the documentation is
    built, this module is included from
    ``EMSM_ROOT/docs/source/plugins/``, but the module is in
    ``EMSM_ROOT/plugins/```.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../emsm/plugins/hellodolly.py

Installation
------------

We want to distribute our plugin because we think it brings so much joy
to all players. So let's create a small package.

This is usually done with the :mod:`plugins.plugins` plugin:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ foo@bar: ls
    hellodolly.py ...
    $ foo@bar: plugin.py --source hellodolly.py
    $ foo@bar: ls
    hellodolly.py hellodolly.tar.bz2 ...

The compressed package archive should now be in your working directory.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    $ foo@bar: # Will print only one row:
    $ foo@bar: minecraft -W hellodolly

    $ foo@bar: # Prints 5 rows or less, if the configuration value is smaller:
    $ foo@bar: minecraft -W hellodolly --rows 5

Documentation
-------------

Acutally, EMSM uses sphinx *autodoc* feature to create the documentation for
the plugins. So what, you see here is the docstring of the ``hellodolly.py``
module.
