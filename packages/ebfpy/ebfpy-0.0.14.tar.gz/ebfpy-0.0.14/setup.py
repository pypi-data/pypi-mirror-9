Python module for reading and writing .ebf files
---------------------------------------------
EBF is a binary format for storing data. It is designed to   
read and write data, easily and efficiently. 
- Store multiple data items in one file, each having a unique tag name
  + tagnames follow the convention of unix style pathname e.g. /x or /mydata/x
- Automatic type and endian conversion  
- Support for multiple programming languages
  + data can easily read in C, C++, Fortran, Java, IDL and Matlab
  + facilitates easy distribution of data 
- Comprehensive numpy support
  + data is read back as numpy arrays
  + almost any numpy array can be written
  + Nested numpy structures are also supported
- Read and write directly a recursive dictionary of numpy arrays
- Internally uses hashtable for fast retireival of data items. 
  + also allows for overwrite prevention
