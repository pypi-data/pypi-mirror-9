Description: Python module for reading and writing .ebf files
        ---------------------------------------------
        EBF is a binary format for storing data. It is designed to   
        read and write data, easily and efficiently. 
        - Store multiple data items in one file, each having a unique tag name
          + tagnames follow the convention of unix style pathname e.g. /x or /mydata/x
        - Automatic type and endian conversion  
        - Support for multiple programming languages
          + data can easily read in C, C++, Fortran, Java, IDL and Matlab
          + facilitates easy distribution of data 
        - Comprehensive numpy support
          + data is read back as numpy arrays
          + almost any numpy array can be written
          + Nested numpy structures are also supported
        - Read and write directly a recursive dictionary of numpy arrays
        - Internally uses hashtable for fast retireival of data items. 
          + also allows for overwrite prevention
