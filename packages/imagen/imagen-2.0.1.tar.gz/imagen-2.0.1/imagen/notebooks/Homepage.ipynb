      "The ImaGen package provides comprehensive support for creating resolution-independent one- and two-dimensional pattern distributions. ImaGen consists of a large library of primarily two-dimensional spatial patterns, including mathematical functions, geometric primitives, and images read from files, along with many ways to combine or select from any other patterns. These patterns can be used in any Python program that needs configurable patterns or streams of patterns.  Basically, as long as the code can accept a Python callable and will call it each time it needs a new pattern, users can then specify any pattern possible in ImaGen's simple declarative pattern language, and the downstream code need not worry about any of the details about how the pattern is specified or generated.  This approach gives users full flexibility about which patterns they wish to use, while relieving the downstream code from having to implement anything about patterns. See below for more background.\n",

      "The ``.anim()`` method collects results at different times conveniently.  What it's doing is repeatedly getting a copy of each pattern, then running ``param.Dynamic.time_fn.advance(1.0)`` to advance the nominal time, then getting another copy of each pattern until 20 different times have been sampled.  The values are \"time dependent\" (because we set them to be so above), so that any randomness changes only when the time changes, and the randomness is computed as a function of time.  That way, regardless of the order you generate the patterns, or even if you go back and forward in time, you will always get the same results at a given nominal time.  In your own code, you can turn off time dependence (``param.Dynamic.time_dependent=False``), in which case new parameter values will be generated for every call to the ``PatternGenerator``.  Or, if you are working in a domain like simulation, you can set ``param.Dynamic.time_fn`` to a function based on your own nominal time, advancing it as appropriate.  You can even set that function to real time, in which case you'll get completely unpredictable randomness, which may be appropriate in some circumstances.  Whenever there is some notion of time that governs the patterns you want to see, setting ``time_dependent=True`` is a good idea, so that you have precise control over the randomness to ensure reproducible results.\n",
