== Device Setup
The YubiKey PIV Manager provides a wizard for initializing an un-initialized
YubiKey. This wizard assumes the default values for the PIN, PUK and Management
Key are set, and may not work correctly if they have been modified. Some
features of the YubiKey PIV Manager require that all management of the device
be done using the YubiKey PIV Manager, so it is recommended that you not use
other tools in combination with the YubiKey PIV Manager to manage your YubiKeys
PIV configuration.

=== Prerequisites
You will need to have the YubiKey PIV Manager and its dependencies installed,
as well as a PIV-enabled YubiKey, with the default PIN, PUK and Management Key
values set.

=== Device Initialization
A PIV-enabled YubiKey comes pre-programmed with the default values for the PIN,
the PUK, and the Management Key. As these default values are known it is
crucial that these be changed before any real use. The YubiKey PIV Manager will
automatically show a _Device Initialization_ dialog if it detects a YubiKey
that uses the default Management Key. It will ask you to provide a PIN,
Management Key, and optionally a PUK. For more details on the various options
provided by this wizard, see link:PIN_and_Management_Key.adoc[PIN and
Management Key].
