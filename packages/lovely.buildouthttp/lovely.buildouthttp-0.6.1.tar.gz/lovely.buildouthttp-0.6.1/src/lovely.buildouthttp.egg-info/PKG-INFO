Description: =========================
        HTTP plugins for buildout
        =========================
        
        HTTP Basic-Authentication
        =========================
        
        With this extension it is possible to define password protected
        package directories without specifying the password and user in the
        url.
        
        Let's take the example protected location, ``http://www.example.com/dist``
        
        First we would need to add the extension and the find link for our
        protected location::
        
            [buildout]
            find-links = http://www.example.com/dist
            extensions = lovely.buildouthttp
        
        Then create the ``.httpauth`` password file, this file contains all
        authentication information. The ``.httpauth`` file can be placed in the root of
        the current buildout or in the ``~/.buildout`` directory. Each row consists of
        ``realm, uri, username, password``.
        
        Here is an example of the ``.httpauth`` file::
        
            Example com realm, http://www.example.com, username, secret
        
        It is also possible to leave the secret away. Then you will be prompted for the
        secret whenever buildout is run::
        
            Example com realm, http://www.example.com, username
        
        Note that basic auth also works with any recipe using
        zc.buildout.download (e.g. hexagonit.recipe.download) because this
        extension also overwrites the url opener of zc.buildout.
        
        Github Private Downloads
        ========================
        
        Private downloads on http://github.com/ require authorization to download.
        The previous token-based authentication system based on the v2 API (see
        http://github.com/blog/170-token-authentication) is no longer supported by
        GitHub as of June 1 2012; You must now request a v3 API token and use that
        instead.
        
        Requesting a new API token can be done in one line using ``curl`` (please
        substitute your own github username and password):
        
            curl -s -X POST -d '{"scopes": ["repo"], "note": "my API token"}' \
                https://${user}:${pass}@api.github.com/authorizations | grep token
        
        Now set the value of github.token to the hash returned from the command above:
        
            git config --global github.accesstoken ${token}
        
        Note that the v3 API does not require your github username to work, and can
        be removed from your configuration if you wish.
        
        For details on managing authorization GitHub's OAuth tokens, see the API
        documentation: http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#oauth-authorizations-api
        
        URL to download a tag or branch::
        
            https://api.github.com/repos/<gituser>/<repos>/tarball/master
        
        URL to downlad a "download"::
        
            https://github.com/downloads/<gituser>/<repos>/<name>
        
        As some eggs on PyPi also use public Github download URLs you may want to
        whitelist the repos that authentication is required for as Github will
        return a 401 error code even for public repositories if the wrong auth
        details are provided.
        To do this just list each repo in the format `<gituser>/<repos>` one per
        line in the buildout config `github-repos`::
        
            [buildout]

        =================
        
        - fixed github authentication
           According to Petros Amiridis (Github Staff), 'POST authentication is no
           longer supported.
        
        2011/03/01 0.4.1:
        =================
        
        - exclude empty lines form .httpauth, this fixes issue 3.
        
        2010/12/29 0.4.0:
        =================
        
        - Allow the inclusion of the .httpauth file from within the buildout itself.
          This adds to the realms set in ``~/.buildout/.httpauth``
        
        2010/10/11 0.3.7:
        =================
        
        - bugfix: make git credentials work without any basic http auth
          definitions
        
        2010/10/11 0.3.6:
        =================
        
        - added missing CHANGES.txt file, this fixes the installation
        
        2010/10/09 0.3.5:
        =================
        
        - the github download credentials are now also added for
          zc.buildout.download based recipies. this allows to use github
          private download urls with any download recipe, such as
          hexagonit.recipe.download
        
        - moved to github http://github.com/lovelysystems/lovely.buildouthttp
        
        2010/09/28 0.3.4:
        =================
        
        - fixed behavour with python 2.6+. python 2.6 suddenly counts ``failed`` requests
          but each request without auth counts as one, that makes buildout fail on
          every 5th download in a single run.
          I found this on windows, but should fail on linux too.
        
        2010/08/28 0.3.3:

        - python2.4 comptibility fix (thanks to Godefroid Chapelle)
        
        2010/05/27 0.3.0:
        =================
        
        - added support for zc.buildout.download, this allows various download
          recipes to work with this credential extension. Requires at least
          zc.buildout version 1.5.0b2
        
        2010/03/24 0.3.0a1:

        2007/08/06 0.2.0a1:
        ===================
        
        - don't overwrite handlers in case a handler already exists. (e.g. in paramiko)
