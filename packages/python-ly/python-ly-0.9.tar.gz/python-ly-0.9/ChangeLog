Changes for python-ly
=====================

2015-03-07: python-ly 0.9
- added ly.rests containing various rest manipulations
- robust Python 3 support, Python 3 is now recommended, although 2.7 will
  still be supported for the foreseeable future.
- don't yield the duration in a \tuplet command as a music token (issue
  wbsoft/frescobaldi#631)
- a script `xml-export.ily` has been included to dump the music structure
  inside LilyPond to an XML file. This is not used yet, but could be used in the
  future to use LilyPond to parse files and build music, and then export it
  to other formats.
