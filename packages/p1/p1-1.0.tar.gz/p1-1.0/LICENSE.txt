Modified January 2015 by Phil Howard <phil@pimoroni.com>
Modifications include support for the Raspberry Pi, mainly a
GPIO-based reset mechanism for GPIO-connected Propeller boards.

Various tweaks to the code have also been made both for general clarity
and to bring it closer to the Python PEP 8 style guidelines.

I have also extensively commented appropriate areas and attempted
to explain in sufficient detail the workings of the protocol.
