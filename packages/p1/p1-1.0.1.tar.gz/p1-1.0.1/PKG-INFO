Description: Python PropellerHAT Code Uploader
        =================================
        
        Code uploader and Python bindings for the Propeller P8X32A Multi-core Microprocessor.
        
        Uploader works as a standalone tool, run with:
        
            sudo python -m p1.loader
        
        Credits
        =======
        
        Thanks to Remy Black for the original code, released on the Parallax
        forums in 2007. I have taken pains to credit him appropriately.o

        Although I have changed the code quite significantly to fix performance
        issues on the Raspberry Pi, and address GPIO reset, much of his work
        remains in-tact and this code should be portable.
        
        Thanks also to Jeff Martin who helped me understand the loader protocol
        and whose improvements to the upload process I hope to implement soon.
