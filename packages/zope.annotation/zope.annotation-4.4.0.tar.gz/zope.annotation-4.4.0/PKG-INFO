        This package provides a mechanism to store additional information about
        objects without need to modify object class.
        
        
        Object Annotations
        ==================
        
        Annotation factories
        --------------------
        
        There is more to document about annotations, but we'll just sketch out
        a scenario on how to use the annotation factory for now. This is one
        of the easiest ways to use annotations -- basically you can see them
        as persistent, writable adapters.
        
        First, let's make a persistent object we can create annotations for:
        
          >>> from zope import interface
          >>> class IFoo(interface.Interface):
          ...     pass
          >>> from zope.annotation.interfaces import IAttributeAnnotatable
          >>> try:
          ...     from persistent import Persistent
          ... except ImportError:
          ...     class Persistent(object):
          ...         pass
          >>> @interface.implementer(IFoo, IAttributeAnnotatable)
          ... class Foo(Persistent):
          ...     pass
        
        We directly say that Foo implements IAttributeAnnotatable here. In
        practice this is often done in ZCML, using the `implements`
        subdirective of the `content` or `class` directive.
        
        Now let's create an annotation for this:
        
          >>> class IBar(interface.Interface):
          ...     a = interface.Attribute('A')
          ...     b = interface.Attribute('B')
          >>> from zope import component
          >>> @interface.implementer(IBar)
          ... class Bar(Persistent):
          ...     component.adapts(IFoo)
          ...     def __init__(self):
          ...         self.a = 1
          ...         self.b = 2
        
        Note that the annotation implementation does not expect any arguments
        to its `__init__`. Otherwise it's basically an adapter.
        
        Now, we'll register the annotation as an adapter. To do this we use
        the `factory` function provided by `zope.annotation`:
        
          >>> from zope.annotation import factory
          >>> component.provideAdapter(factory(Bar))
        
        Note that we do not need to specify what the adapter provides or what
        it adapts - we already do this on the annotation class itself.
        
        Now let's make an instance of `Foo`, and make an annotation for it.
        
          >>> foo = Foo()
          >>> bar = IBar(foo)
          >>> bar.a
          1
          >>> bar.b
          2
        
        We'll change `a` and get the annotation again. Our change is still
        there:
        
          >>> bar.a = 3
          >>> IBar(foo).a
          3
        
        Of course it's still different for another instance of `Foo`:
        
          >>> foo2 = Foo()
          >>> IBar(foo2).a
          1
        
        What if our annotation does not provide what it adapts with
        `component.adapts`? It will complain:
        
          >>> class IQux(interface.Interface):
          ...     pass
          >>> @interface.implementer(IQux)
          ... class Qux(Persistent):
          ...     pass
          >>> component.provideAdapter(factory(Qux)) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
          Traceback (most recent call last):
          ...
          TypeError: Missing 'zope.component.adapts' on annotation
        
        It's possible to provide an annotation with an explicit key. (If the
        key is not supplied, the key is deduced from the annotation's dotted
        name, provided it is a class.)
        
          >>> class IHoi(interface.Interface):
          ...     pass
          >>> @interface.implementer(IHoi)
          ... class Hoi(Persistent):
          ...     component.adapts(IFoo)
          >>> component.provideAdapter(factory(Hoi, 'my.unique.key'))
          >>> isinstance(IHoi(foo), Hoi)
          True
        
        
        Location
        --------
        
        Annotation factories are put into the location hierarchy with their parent
        pointing to the annotated object and the name to the dotted name of the
        annotation's class (or the name the adapter was registered under):
        
          >>> foo3 = Foo()
          >>> new_hoi = IHoi(foo3)
          >>> new_hoi.__parent__
          <Foo object at 0x...>
          >>> new_hoi.__name__
          'my.unique.key'
          >>> import zope.location.interfaces
          >>> zope.location.interfaces.ILocation.providedBy(new_hoi)
          True
        
        Please notice, that our Hoi object does not implement ILocation, so a
        location proxy will be used. This has to be re-established every time we
        retrieve the object
        
        (Guard against former bug: proxy wasn't established when the annotation
        existed already.)
        
          >>> old_hoi = IHoi(foo3)
          >>> old_hoi.__parent__
          <Foo object at 0x...>
          >>> old_hoi.__name__
          'my.unique.key'
          >>> zope.location.interfaces.ILocation.providedBy(old_hoi)
          True
        
        
        LocationProxies
        ---------------
        
        Suppose your annotation proxy provides ILocation.
        
          >>> class IPolloi(interface.Interface):
          ...     pass
          >>> @interface.implementer(IPolloi, zope.location.interfaces.ILocation)
          ... class Polloi(Persistent):
          ...     component.adapts(IFoo)
          ...     __name__ = __parent__ = 0
          >>> component.provideAdapter(factory(Polloi, 'my.other.key'))
        
        Sometimes you're adapting an object wrapped in a LocationProxy.
        
          >>> foo4 = Foo()
          >>> import zope.location.location
          >>> wrapped_foo4 = zope.location.location.LocationProxy(foo4, None, 'foo4')
          >>> located_polloi = IPolloi(wrapped_foo4)
        
        At first glance it looks as if located_polloi is located under wrapped_foo4.
        
          >>> located_polloi.__parent__ is wrapped_foo4
          True
          >>> located_polloi.__name__
          'my.other.key'
        
        but that's because we received a LocationProxy
        
          >>> type(located_polloi).__name__
          'LocationProxy'
        
        If we unwrap located_polloi and look at it directly, we'll see it stores a
        reference to the real Foo object
        
          >>> from zope.proxy import removeAllProxies
          >>> removeAllProxies(located_polloi).__parent__ == foo4
          True
          >>> removeAllProxies(located_polloi).__name__
          'my.other.key'
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        4.4.0 (2015-01-09)
        ------------------
        
        - LP #98462:  add additional "iterable mapping" methods to ``IAnnotations``.
        
        - LP #878265:

            installable via the ``zope.annotation[btree]`` extra.
        
          - Make ``BTrees`` (used for attribute storage) a soft dependency,
            installable via the ``zope.annotation[btree]`` extra.  Fall back to
            using ``dict`` for attribute storage if ``BTrees`` is not importable.

        ------------------
        
        - Add ZODB3 to install_requires, because it's a true requirement of this
          package, not just a testing requirement, as BTrees are in use.
        
        - Fix one test that was inactive because it's function was overriden by
          a mistake.
        
        3.4.2 (2009-03-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Clean up package description and documentation a bit.
        
        - Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
          zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.
        
        - Remove old zpkg-related files.
        
        3.4.1 (2008-08-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Annotation factories take care not to store proxies in the database,
          so adapting an object wrapped in a ``LocationProxy`` works correctly.
          Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/261620
        
        3.4.0 (2007-08-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Annotation factories are no longer containing the factored object.
          Instead the objects are located using ``zope.location``. This removes
          a dependency to ``zope.app.container``.
