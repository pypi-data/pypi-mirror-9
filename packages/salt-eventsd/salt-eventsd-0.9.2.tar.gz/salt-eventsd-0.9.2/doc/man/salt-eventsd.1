.sp
A python-daemon that collects events from the salt-event bus
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-eventsd [fg]
.ft P
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The salt-eventsd collects events from the salt-masters event-bus and writes them into a database. The events to act on and the database and table to insert into are configurable per event. Events are recognized by their 'tag'. Since many events can have different types of data-structures and we do not always want all the data, the source-datafield (usually a dictionary) and the fields to use from it can be configured. The fields taken are then matched into a customizabe sql-template to be written into to a database.
