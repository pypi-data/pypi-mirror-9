class IRCClient(asyncio.Protocol):
    """ IRC client class managing the network connection and dispatching
        messages from the server.

    .. warning:: Currently only a single IRCClient instance is allowed! Don't
        run multiple clients. This will result in undefined behaviour. Also
        after :py:meth:`.run` terminated you should not call it again!
        This will probably be fixed in future releases.

    To connect to the server and start the processing event loop call
    :py:meth:`run()<.IRCClient.run>` on your IRCClient instance.
    Nick, user name, real name and password are used by
    :py:meth:`.register` to register the client to the server.

    Most methods and members that return some state of the client
    (e.g. :py:meth:`.is_op_in` or :py:attr:`.channels`) do not need to interact
    with the server to get the corresponding information. Instead it is cached
    in the client.

    It is also important to remember that the data in the client is only updated
    on messages from the server.
    For Example: :py:attr:`.channels` will
    not contain a new channel instantly after joining it with
    :py:meth:`.join` but only after
    :py:meth:`handle_own_join()<.IRCHandler.handle_own_join>` was called.

    Args:
        handler (:py:class:`IRCHandler<fredirc.IRCHandler>`): \
            handler that handles events from this client
        nick (str): nick name for the client
        server (str): server name or ip
        port (int): port number to connect to
        user_name (str): User name for registration to the server.
                         If None, nick is used.
        real_name (str): Full name of the client. If None, nick is used.
        password (str): Optional password that can be used to
                        authenticate to the server.

class IRCClientState(object):
    """ Stores the state of an IRCClient.

    This class is **internally** used by IRCClient to keep track of it's
    current state.
    The main purpose is to bundle all the needed information and thus make it
    easier to keep track of them.

    .. note:: The state information in this class should only be set in
              consequence of a message from the server confirming that state.
              For example: The nick should not be set when the client sends a
              nick message, but when it receives a message from the server that
              says the nick has changed.

    To change the state the public properties connected and registered can be
    set directly.
    Note that there are dependencies between the states of the client.
    If a client is registered, it must also be connected and if it is not
    connected it can't be registered. These constraints are preserved
    automatically.

    For example:

    ..code-block:: python

    state = IRCClientState()
    state.connected = True
    state.registered = True
    state.connected = False
    print(state.registered) # False
