throughout the site and have special built-in search engine optimization tools, authorship properties, and selective permission settings to customize who can view and/or edit Articles on your website.</p>\r\n<p>This Help File will explain the features available in the Articles module so you can begin adding Article content to your website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more help on using your Tendenci Articles Module, visit the helpfile <a href=\"http://www.tendenci.com/help-files/add-edit-articles/\" target=\"_blank\">Adding and Editing Articles</a>&nbsp;within&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tendenci.com/help-files\" target=\"_blank\">Tendenci Support Documentation</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<h2>Why You Might Use Articles</h2>\r\n<p>Articles have a variety of uses and these are a few examples to help you understand how other Tendenci clients are using this content module. &nbsp;Feel free to think outside the box and use articles in other ways that suit your own organization's needs.</p>\r\n<h3>A Few Articles Content Ideas:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Research Papers</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Blog Posts</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Members Announcements</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>How-To Guides</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Landing Pages for Custom Form submissions and Special Events</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Industry News Items</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Whitepapers</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Create a New Article</h2>\r\n<p>Creating a new article is easy. &nbsp;The first thing you'll want to do is go to your Blue Superuser Nav Menu at the top of your website, (you must be logged in as an Superuser/Staff/ to access this) and underneath the \"Content\" dropdown, you'll find \"Articles\". &nbsp;Click on the green circle with the plus sign inside next to Articles to add a new article.</p>\r\n<p>This will create a new Article that you can now add and save. &nbsp;Here are the different content fields of an Article and explanations on what each field does.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that items marked with a&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;are required. &nbsp;All other fields are optional.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Headline*</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Headline is the Title of your article and is what will display at the top of your article as well as in the Articles search view. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>URL Path*</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The URL path is the article link after http://yoursite.com/articles/</li>\r\n<li>For example, if you enter&nbsp;<em><strong>great-story&nbsp;</strong></em>in the URL path in the image above, and your website is<em><strong>http://greatwebsite.com&nbsp;</strong></em>then the link once you've saved the article would be<em><strong>http://greatwebsite.com/articles/great-story</strong></em>.</li>\r\n<li>You can customize the URL path or simply hit tab after you've entered in your Headline and Tendenci will auto-suggest a URL Path for you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Summary</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Summary box is where you type a short description that explains what the article is about. &nbsp;This should be 2-3 sentences that will explain why someone wants to read the article. &nbsp;The summary is displayed on the Articles Search and in the RSS feed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Article Body*</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The body of the article is the rich text (WYSIWYG) editor where you can add your text, upload and embed media including photos, images, and files, and customize the look and layout of your Article. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Tags</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Tags enable your site users to quickly search for articles with similar topics and are search engine friendly. &nbsp;You can also use tags to dynamically pull in content from Articles to your homepage and custom boxes. &nbsp;(This is an<a href=\"http://tendenci.com/help-files/t5-template-tags/\" target=\"_blank\">advanced feature</a>&nbsp;that requires some basic knowledge of Django Template Tags and web design.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Source</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The source is the name of the company, non-profit, or media outlet where this Article was obtained. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Website</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The website field is for linking to the URL of the Source. &nbsp;You can enter the website URL as http://website.com, www.website.com, or http://www.website.com and each format will work correctly. &nbsp;Once saved, this field will be converted into a hyperlink and displayed with the article for readers to link to if they'd like.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Release Date/Time</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Release Date/Time is a field to select the date and time that you publicized the article. &nbsp;This can be the data and time that you created the article here, on your Tendenci website or it can be a custom selected date/time based on when the article was first released elsewhere. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Time Zone</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This field is to customize the time zone for the release date.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Contact Box</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The contact box allows the author or publisher of the article to be credited and provide contact information where they can be reached. &nbsp;All of these fields are optional.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Permissions Settings</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Permissions Settings allow you to customize who is allowed to view and/or edit this specific article. &nbsp;You can select Public View, (all visitors can see), or choose from Groups, Users, Membership Types, and Superuser only permission options by clicking the \"Show Advanced Permissions\" link. &nbsp;Read more about Tendenci's content specific permissions controls in this&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tendenci.com/help-files/using-content-specific-permission-settings-in-tendenci/\" target=\"_blank\">help file</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Superuser Only Settings</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Superuser Only settings are only visible to Superuser-level site users. &nbsp;These settings include selecting to include the article in your RSS feed, and then whether to publish the article (check \"Active\") or to keep the article unpublished if you aren't done editing but want to save it (uncheck \"Active\"). &nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>The Status detail drop down gives you a way to noting if you want to article Active, Pending, or if you have made it Inactive. &nbsp;The status detail is ONLY for a quick way of noting why the article is active or inactive and has nothing to do with publishing the article. &nbsp;You must have the \"Active\" checkbox checked above the Status detail menu to publish the article.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Add Articles Button</strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>After you have added your content, simple click the Add Articles button to save and finish creating your Article. &nbsp;You will be directed to the Articles View page after it has saved.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Edit an Article</h2>\r\n<p>Editing an article is just as simple. To Edit an article, navigate to the article's page view while logged in as a site Superuser.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Then, mouseover the Articles Tab to dropdown the Articles options:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>and select \"Edit Articles\" to edit the Article. &nbsp;Follow the same guidelines for the fields as described above when adding a new article and then click the \"Save Articles\" button.</p>\r\n<h3>Did This Help File Answer Your Question?

That's why Tendenci includes a List view for each day of the month. To go to the list view for a specific date, click on the numerical day of the month on the calendar.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Events List View</h2>\r\n<p>The List View (or Search view, as it is also sometimes referenced), displays a searchable list view of your upcoming events. &nbsp;If you have multiple events going on everyday - you'll probably want to send your site visitors to the List View instead of the Calendar View. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If your organization has multiple chapters that are all using your events calendar to promote events or you often list different community events on your calendar then you'll find the List View more useful for displaying and searching Events. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>List View Features</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The List View has a different format from the Calendar view, but still functions basically the same. &nbsp;At the top of the list view, your site visitors can search for events by date and type or use the search bar to search all events.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Just click on any event's search results title to go to the Event's description page with registration information. &nbsp;There is also an Events Tab with the drop down menu just like the Calendar View has.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Did This Help File Answer Your Question?
