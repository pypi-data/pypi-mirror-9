# WAIT! HOLD ON THERE JUST A SEC. UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE! TRY TENDENCI 6!

The installation information below will still work for the master branch, but if you are considering Tendenci, I'd suggest you try the Tendenci 6 branch (not "master" but "tendenci6") and of course use the project template located here

-------------

Tendenci 5.+ is the next iteration of a product started in 2001 and released open source in 2012. It is built specifically for NPOs (Non Profit Organizations.) We started with a focus completely on associations but now being open source GPL it is much broader in scope. 
It is a content management system (CMS) with powerful features for event registration, membership management, donations, payments, email integration and much more.

Tendenci allows membership management organizations to communicate, manage and conduct transactions with web site visitors. Tendenci is easy to use and offers many modules as one customizable software package. The 5.x version is open source and built on Django/Python/Postgres and Ubuntu.

## Impatient Developer?  

If you want to test it locally quickly (e.g. client demo etc), you can try it ASAP three ways (do NOT use thse in production).  

1) Vagrant Box [https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci-vagrant/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci-vagrant/blob/master/README.md)  
2) Virtual Machine Version here: [https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci/blob/master/demostrator.md](https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci/blob/master/demostrator.md)  
3) TKL version is out of date so pulled the link.

## Developer Installing Tendenci?  

Community forums for questions that may not fit in issues on github or solutions to questions on installation. We check these more frequently than the issues on github and it is also where you can read about the Roadmap going forward. Your input is greatly appreciated! (Seriously - this changing the world stuff is hard and we could use your input and maybe a few pull requests too!)

Detailed installation docs at [https://tendenci.readthedocs.org/en/latest/](https://tendenci.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). 
You will need to install the server on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (or later) and Postgres 9.3 (or later.) Cloud hypervisors work fine.  

Dockers? We are using them in our test environments now. We'll have a public docker file up soon in the dockers.io registry. Testing internally currently and I want it to come out on Django 1.6at a minimum. So until we get the migrations set up please hang on. It is based on the phusion/basebox so feel free to play with that in the meanttime. Or make a container and do an install with netsetter on your own docker.

Have you deployed Tendenci in a Production Environment? Tell us in the forums please! There are no "trackers" in Tendenci as that goes against our values. So we really only know if you have a site up if you tell us.

## Humans Looking for a Hosted Solution?  

Not a programmer and you just want to host it somewhere else? You can ask your currentfavorite web developer who you already work with. Or do a free trial on tendenci.com. Cool with us either way. We'll even help them set you up if needed. Geek to Geek.  

## Why Did We Make Tendenci Open Source?  

Tendenci was built by the team at Schipul.com iteratively by releasing the core for event registrations. We listened to our clients and over the last 12+ years it has evolved. From LISTENING.  

Our vision: "Connect and Oragnize the World's People" 
Our mission: "To make Tendenci the number 1 platform for NPOs/NGOs/Arts organizations globally."  

Um... and we can't do that without you and the community. How can your organization help Tendenci? Fork it. Build and extend on it. Deploy it. Translate it. Or simply submit an issue if you find a bug.  
Be part of a global movement to reclaim the NGO online space from proprietary companies holding your data hostage.
