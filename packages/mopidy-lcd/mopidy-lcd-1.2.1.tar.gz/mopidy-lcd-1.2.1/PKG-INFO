Description: A sample Python project
        =======================
        
        This is the description file for the project.
        
        The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using ReStructured Text. It
        will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI, and should be written for
        that purpose.
        
        Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
        usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
        a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
        may be appropriate.
