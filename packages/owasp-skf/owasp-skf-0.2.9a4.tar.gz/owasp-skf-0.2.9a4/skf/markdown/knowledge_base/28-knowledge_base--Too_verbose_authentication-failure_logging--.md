Too verbose authentication-failure logging
-------

**Description:**

The error messages that are displayed when a user fails to login into an application 
should selected with caution. When this error message gives away too much information, 
this information can be exploited by a hacker.


**Solution:**

The application should never publish available usernames. When an attacker gains this 
information he increases his attack vector and reduces the time 
required to identify accounts.

i.e:

Imagine an "forgot password" function where the user enters his username in order for the 
application to send a new password to his email adress, the user enters a correct username
and the application responds with:

Email succesfully send to your email adress.
when the user enters a incorrect username it says.
Error: user does not exsist.

This function would be vulnerable to username enumeration
