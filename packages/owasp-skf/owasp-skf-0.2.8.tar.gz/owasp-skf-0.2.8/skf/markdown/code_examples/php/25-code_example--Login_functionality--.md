    /*

    For privilege based authentication we need an extra tabel in your database in order to write the users privileges to.

    TABLE users
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    | userID | userName | password | privilegeID |    access	| AggregrateControl	|
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
    |   1	 | Admin	| Csdar323 |	  1		 | 	   TRUE		|		2336		|
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   	
    |	2	 | User		| Adf4fsv  |	  2		 |	   FALSE	|		 0			|
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
    |	3	 | Guest	| dff4fKr  |	  3		 |	   TRUE		|		135			|
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

    TABLE privileges
    ----------------------------------   
    | privilegeID | privilege 		 | 
    ----------------------------------
    |     1	 	  | edit:read:delete |
    ----------------------------------
    |	  2	 	  | edit:read		 |
    ----------------------------------
    |	  3	 	  | read			 |
    ----------------------------------

    Now instead of using roles in sessions we rather want to assign privileges to users 
    by means of a Database-Based Authentication system. 
    Now we can easily assign a user certain privileges for him to access.
