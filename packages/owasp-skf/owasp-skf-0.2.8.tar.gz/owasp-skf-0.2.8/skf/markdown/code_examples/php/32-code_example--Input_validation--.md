     	First example is about input validation. We want to filter the user input for expected values, 
     	for this example we only expect a-z/0-9. Whenever the values are tampered with
        we can assume a hacker is trying to inject malicious input
     	*/

			Set counter if counter hits 3 the users session must terminated
			After 3 session terminations the user acount must be blocked

        Seccond example, let's assume you have a checkbox form on your application, whenever a checkbox is checked it has a certain
        fixed expected value. whenever these value's differ from your fixed value's you can determin the user is tampering
        the value's and should be blocked since he is probably intercepting your parameters with an intercepting proxy.
