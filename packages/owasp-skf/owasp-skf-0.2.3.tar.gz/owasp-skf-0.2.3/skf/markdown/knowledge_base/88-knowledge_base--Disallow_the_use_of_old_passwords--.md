Disallow the use of old passwords
-------

**Description:**

This is a mitigation of the risk that a password can leak by any means. 
By changing the password to a new one minimises the damage.


**Solution:**

Keep the old entries of the password record of the user. If the user changes his password 
you can match against the old entries to validate it is not an old one.
