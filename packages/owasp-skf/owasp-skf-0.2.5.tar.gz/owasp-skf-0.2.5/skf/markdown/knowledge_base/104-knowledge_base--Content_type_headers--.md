Content type headers
-------

**Description:**

This reduces exposure to drive-by download attacks or sites serving user uploaded 
content that, by clever naming could be treated by MS Internet Explorer as executable or 
dynamic HTML files and thus can lead to security vulnerabilities.


**Solution:**

An example of a content type header would be - Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
