V15.10 Verify the application has business limits and enforces them in a trusted location (as on a protected server) on a per user, per day or daily basis, with configurable alerting and automated reactions to automated or unusual attack. Examples include (but not limited to): ensuring new SIM users don&#39;t exceed $10 per day for a new phone account, a forum allowing more than 100 new users per day or preventing posts or private messages until the account has been verified, a health system should not allow a single doctor to access more patient records than they can reasonably treat in a day, or a small business finance system allowing more than 20 invoice payments or $1000 per day across all users. In all cases, the business limits and totals should be reasonable for the business concerned. The only unreasonable outcome is if there are no business limits, alerting or enforcement.
