Customizing the local condor configuration on the VM
----------------------------------------------------

The customization of the local condor config file on the VM is done
via the Nimbus Workspace Customization mechanism.  The variable that
needs to be customized needs to be written to the following file on
the VM:

   /etc/condor/condor_config.local.modifications

The format to use is the following:

    <variable_name>=<value>
    <variable_name>=<value>
    ...

For example, suppose we want to set the START attribute to only accept
jobs from a specific user, then the above file would contain:

    START=(RemoteUser == "userfoo@baz.edu")

When the /etc/init.d/condor init script is called to start the condor
deamons, it will firt check if the above file exist.  If it does, then
it will parse it line by line and update the local condor config file
accordingly.  If the variable is already present in the condor config
file, it's value will simply be overwritten.  If the variable is not
present, then it will be appended to the end of the config file.
