Cloud Scheduler EC2 Context Helper

This script contextualizes your EC2 VM with Nimbus Style Context Data.

To install it to start at runtime, just run the setup, and chkconfig:

# python setup.py install
# chmod +x /etc/init.d/context
# chkconfig context on

# check that the contexthelper script is in the path, if not make sure that CONTEXT_HELPER in /etc/init.d/context is updated with the full path of contexthelper (ie. /usr/local/bin/contexthelper)
