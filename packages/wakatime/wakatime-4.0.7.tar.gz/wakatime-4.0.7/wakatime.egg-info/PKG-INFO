Description: WakaTime
        ========
        
        Fully automatic time tracking for programmers.
        
        This is the common interface for the WakaTime api. You shouldn't need to directly use this package unless you are creating a new plugin or your text editor's plugin asks you to install the wakatime cli interface.
        
        Go to http://wakatime.com to install the plugin for your text editor.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install the plugin for your IDE/editor at https://wakatime.com/plugins
        
        If you are building a plugin using the `WakaTime API <https://wakatime.com/developers/>`_
        then follow the `Creating a Plugin <https://wakatime.com/help/misc/creating-plugin>`_
        guide.
        
        
        Configuring
        -----------
        
        Options can be passed via command line, or set in the ``$HOME/.wakatime.cfg``
        config file. Command line arguments take precedence over config file settings.
        The ``$HOME/.wakatime.cfg`` file is in `INI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`_
        format. An example config file looks like::
            [settings]
            debug = false
            api_key = your-api-key
            hidefilenames = false
            exclude =
                ^COMMIT_EDITMSG$
                ^TAG_EDITMSG$
                ^/var/
                ^/etc/
            include =
                .*
            offline = true
            proxy = https://user:pass@localhost:8080
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Each `plugin <https://wakatime.com/plugins>`_ should install wakatime for you, except for the `Emacs WakaTime plugin <https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime-mode>`_.
        If your plugin does not install wakatime cli(this package), install it with::
            pip install wakatime
