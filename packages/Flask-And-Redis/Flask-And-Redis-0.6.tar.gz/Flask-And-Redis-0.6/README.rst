Flask-And-Redis provides simple as dead support of `Redis <http://redis.io>`_
database for `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ applications. Extension built
around beautiful `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_ library
by Andy McCurdy.

* Works on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3+
* BSD licensed
* Latest documentation `on Read the Docs
  <http://flask-and-redis.readthedocs.org>`_
* Source, issues and pull requests `on GitHub
  <https://github.com/playpauseandstop/Flask-And-Redis>`_
* Install with ``pip install Flask-And-Redis``

.. note:: ``Flask-And-Redis`` named as is, cause ``Flask-Redis`` name already
   `taken <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Redis>`_, but that library didn't
   match my needs.
