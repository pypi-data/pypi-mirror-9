#FORD
This is an automatic documentation generator for modern Fortran programs.
FORD stands for FORtran Documenter. As you may know, "to ford" refers to
crossing a river (or other body of water). It does not, in this context, refer
to any company or individual associated with cars.

Ford was written due to [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)'s
poor handling of Fortran and the lack of comparable alternatives.
[ROBODoc](http://rfsber.home.xs4all.nl/Robo/index.html) can't actually extract
any information from the source code and just about any other automatic
documentation software I found was either proprietary, didn't work very well
for Fortran, or was limited in terms of how it produced its output.
[f90doc](http://erikdemaine.org/software/f90doc/) is quite good and I managed
to modify it so that it could handle most of Fortran 2003, but it produces
rather ugly documentation, can't provide as many links between different parts
of the documentation as I'd like, and is written in Perl (which I'm not that
familiar with and which lacks the sort of libraries found in Python for
producing HTML content).

The goal of FORD is to be able to reliably produce documentation for modern
Fortran software which is informative and nice to look at. The documentation
should be easy to write and non-obtrusive within the code. While it will never
be as feature-rich as Doxygen, hopefully FORD will be able to provide a good
alternative for documenting Fortran projects.

##Capabilities
Current features include:

- the ability to extract information about variables, procedures, procedure
  arguments, derived types, programs, and modules from the source code.
- the ability to extract documentation from comments in the source code.
- LaTeX support in documentation using [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/).
- searchable documentation, using [Tipue Search](http://www.tipue.com/search/).
- author description and social media (including Github!) links.
- links to download the source code.
- links to individual files, both in their raw form or in HTML with syntax
  highlighting.
- use of Markdown to type-set documentation.
- links between related parts of the software.
- Bootstrap CSS for the documentation, making it both functional and pretty.
- configurable settings.

##Installation
The simplest way to install FORD is using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/).
This can be done with the command

    sudo pip install ford

Pip will automatically handle all dependencies for you. If
you do not have administrative rights on the computer where you want to produce
documentation, pip will allow you to install FORD and its dependencies in a
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) located somewhere in
your home directory.

If you prefer, you can install all of those dependencies manually and clone
FORD from Github. Then place FORD somewhere in your PYTHONPATH.

##Documentation
More complete documentation can be found in the [project wiki](https://github.com/cmacmackin/ford/wiki).

##Approach
The basic algorithm for generating the documentation is as follows:

- Get instructions from user. These are to be passes as command-line arguments
  and meta-data within the project file.
- Parse each file which is to be documented.
   - Create a file object. This will contain any documentation meant for the
     file as a whole and a list of any file contents.
   - Create module, subroutine, function, and/or program objects for each of
     these structures within the file. Each of these objects will also store
	 comments, contents, and parameters.
   - Continue to recurse into these structures, adding interface, type,
     variable, subroutine and function objects as necessary.
- Perform further analysis on the parsed code, correlating anything defined
  in one place but used in another. This will be used to generate hyperlinks
  when producing the documentation.
- Convert comments into HTML. Assume that they have been written in Markdown.
  Also make sure to process LaTeX (not yet implemented).
- Produce the documentation. This will be done using Jinja2 templates.
