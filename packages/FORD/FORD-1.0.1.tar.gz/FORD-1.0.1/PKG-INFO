Description: FORD
        ====
        
        This is an automatic documentation generator for modern Fortran
        programs. FORD stands for FORtran Documenter. As you may know, "to ford"
        refers to crossing a river (or other body of water). It does not, in
        this context, refer to any company or individual associated with cars.
        
        Ford was written due to
        `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`__'s poor handling of
        Fortran and the lack of comparable alternatives.
        `ROBODoc <http://rfsber.home.xs4all.nl/Robo/index.html>`__ can't
        actually extract any information from the source code and just about any
        other automatic documentation software I found was either proprietary,
        didn't work very well for Fortran, or was limited in terms of how it
        produced its output.
        `f90doc <http://erikdemaine.org/software/f90doc/>`__ is quite good and I
        managed to modify it so that it could handle most of Fortran 2003, but
        it produces rather ugly documentation, can't provide as many links
        between different parts of the documentation as I'd like, and is written
        in Perl (which I'm not that familiar with and which lacks the sort of
        libraries found in Python for producing HTML content).
        
        The goal of FORD is to be able to reliably produce documentation for
        modern Fortran software which is informative and nice to look at. The
        documentation should be easy to write and non-obtrusive within the code.
        While it will never be as feature-rich as Doxygen, hopefully FORD will
        be able to provide a good alternative for documenting Fortran projects.
        
        Capabilities
        ------------
        
        Current features include:
        
        -  the ability to extract information about variables, procedures,
           procedure arguments, derived types, programs, and modules from the
           source code.
        -  the ability to extract documentation from comments in the source
           code.
        -  LaTeX support in documentation using
           `MathJax <http://www.mathjax.org/>`__.
        -  searchable documentation, using `Tipue
           Search <http://www.tipue.com/search/>`__.
        -  author description and social media (including Github!) links.
        -  links to download the source code.
        -  links to individual files, both in their raw form or in HTML with
           syntax highlighting.
        -  use of Markdown to type-set documentation.
        -  links between related parts of the software.
        -  Bootstrap CSS for the documentation, making it both functional and
           pretty.
        -  configurable settings.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The simplest way to install FORD is using
        `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__. This can be done with the
        command
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip install ford
        
        Pip will automatically handle all dependencies for you. If you do not
        have administrative rights on the computer where you want to produce
        documentation, pip will allow you to install FORD and its dependencies
        in a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ located
        somewhere in your home directory.
