:py:mod:`obigrep`: filters sequence file 
========================================

.. codeauthor:: Eric Coissac <eric.coissac@metabarcoding.org>

The :py:mod:`obigrep` command is in some way analog to the standard Unix `grep`
command.
It selects a subset of sequence records from a sequence file. 

A sequence record is a complex object composed of an identifier, 
a set of attributes (``key=value``), a definition, and the sequence itself. 

Instead of working text line by text line as the standard Unix tool, selection is 
done sequence record by sequence record. 
A large set of options allows refining selection on any of the sequence record 
elements.

Moreover :py:mod:`obigrep` allows specifying simultaneously several conditions (that 
take the value ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE``) and only the sequence records that fulfill all 
the conditions (all conditions are ``TRUE``) are selected.
