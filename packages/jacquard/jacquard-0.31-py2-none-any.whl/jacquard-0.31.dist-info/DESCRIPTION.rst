## Subcommands
    translate           Accepts a directory of VCF results (including VarScan high
                        confidence files). Creates a new directory of VCFs,
                        adding Jacquard-specific FORMAT tags for each VCF
                        record.
    filter_hc_somatic   Accepts a directory of Jacquard-tagged VCF results
                        from one or more callers and creates a new directory
                        of VCFs, where rows have been filtered to contain only
                        positions that were called as high-confidence somatic 
                        in any VCF.
    merge               Accepts a directory of VCFs and returns a single
                        merged VCF file.
    summarize           Accepts a Jacquard-merged VCF file and creates a new VCF
                        file, adding summary fields/tags.
    expand              Transforms VCF file into tab-separated text file 
                        expanding INFO fields and FORMAT tags into distinct
                        columns.
