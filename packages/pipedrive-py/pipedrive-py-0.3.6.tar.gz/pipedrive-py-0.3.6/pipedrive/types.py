    Sometimes, in the JSON responses sent by the Pipedrive api there's a dict
    where a numeric id should be - e.g. in the Deal response, the user_id field
    holds the actual user data instead of the user's numeric id.

    For the sake of consistency, those fields should be set to be a
    PipedriveModelType field. It works like ModelType, with a few differences:

    - Fields of this type can receive an int value - in this case, a new object
      of the model type is created and stored in the field, and the passed value
      becomes the object's id.

    - Fields of this type can receive a dict with the object's data, which will
      then be converted to the model type through dict_to_model.

    - When an object is converted to a dict, PipedriveModelType fields will hold
      only the object's numeric id.

    This way, our models can communicate seamlessly with the Pipedrive api.

    Last but not least: the natural solution would be having PipedriveModelType
    extend ModelType, but for an undisclosed reason (a bug, maybe?), the
    to_primitive method in the ModelType class never seems to be called. So,
    we extend BaseType directly. It's not as robust as ModelType, but it's
    strong enough for our needs.
