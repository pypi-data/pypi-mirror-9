Description: 
        Ipse Dixit
        ==========
        
        This package runs a Markov chain algorithm over the surviving works of
        the Roman historian Tacitus to generate naturalistic-looking pseudo-Latin
        gibberish.
        
        Can be used whenever you need to generate dummy text as a placeholder
        in templates, etc.
        
        Installs both as a library module and as a command line script.
        
        See the project's Github homepage (https://github.com/dmulholland/ipsedixit)
        for further details.
        
        Note that this package requires Python 3.
