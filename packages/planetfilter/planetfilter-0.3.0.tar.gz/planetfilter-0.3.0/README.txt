# PlanetFilter

PlanetFilter uses a blacklist to filter a blog aggregator feed. It allows
anyone to subscribe to popular blog aggregators without being overwhelmed by
the noise.

It supports the RSS, RSS 2.0 and Atom formats.

## Installation

To install using pip, simply do this:

    $ pip install planetfilter

## Usage

To filter a given author out of a blog aggregator, create a config file for
that aggregator:

    [feed]
    url=http://planet.mozilla.org/rss20.xml

    [blacklist]
    authors = The Mozilla Blog
      Mozilla Release Management Team
    titles =
      Product Coordination Meeting

and then run:

    planetfilter --output filtered.xml planet.conf
