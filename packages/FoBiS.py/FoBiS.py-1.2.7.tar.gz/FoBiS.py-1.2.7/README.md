# FoBiS.py
### <a name="top"></a>FoBiS.py, Fortran Building System for poor men
A KISS tool for automatic building modern Fortran projects.

## Why?
GNU Make, CMake, SCons & Co. are fantastic tools, even too much for a _poor-fortran-man_.
However, the support for modern Fortran project is still poor: in particular, it is quite difficult (and boring) to track the inter-module-dependency hierarchy of project using many module files.
Modern Fortran programs can take great advantage of using modules; however their compilations can quickly become a nightmare as the number of modules grows. As  a consequence, an automatic build system able to track (on the fly) any changes on the inter-module-dependency hierarchy can save the life of a _poor-fortran-man_.

### Why not use an auto-make-like tool?
There are a lot of alternatives for deal with inter-module-dependency hierarchy, but they can be viewed as a pre-processor for the actual building system (such as auto-make tools or even the Fortran compiler itself that, in most cases, can generate a dependency list of a processed file), thus they introduce another level of complexity... but a _poor-fortran-man_ always loves the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) things! FoBiS.py is designed to do just one thing: build a modern Fortran program without boring you to specify a particular compilation hierarchy.

### OK, what can FoBiS.py do? I am a _poor-fortran-man_, I do not understand you...
Suppose you have a Fortran project composed of many Fortran modules placed into a complicated nested directories tree. Your goal is to build some (all) of the main programs contained into the project tree, but you have no time (or patience) to write the complicated makefile(s) able to correctly build your programs. In this case FoBiS.py can save your life: just type _python FoBiS.py build_ in the root of your project and FoBis.py will (try to) build all the main programs nested into the current directory. Obviously, FoBiS.py will not (re-)compile unnecessary objects if they are up-to-date (like the "magic" of a makefile). FoBiS.py have many (ok... some) others interesting features: if I have convinced you, please read the following.

## Main features
+ Automatic parsing of files for dependency-hierarchy creation in case of _use_ and _include_ statements;
+ automatic building of all _programs_ found into the root directory parsed or only a specific selected target;
+ avoid unnecessary re-compilation (algorithm based on file-timestamp value);
+ simple command line interface;
+ Intel, GNU and g95 Fortran Compilers support;
+ custom compiler support;
+ configuration-files-free;
+ ... but also configuration-file driven building for complex buildings;
+ parallel compiling enabled by means of concurrent multiprocesses jobs;
+ generation of GNU Make makefile  with rules fully supporting dependency-hierarchy for _make-irriducible users_;
+ easy-extensible: FoBis.py is just a less-than 1000 lines of Python statements... no bad for a poor-make-replacement;
+ well integrate with a flexible pythonic pre-processor, [PreForM.py](https://github.com/szaghi/PreForM).
