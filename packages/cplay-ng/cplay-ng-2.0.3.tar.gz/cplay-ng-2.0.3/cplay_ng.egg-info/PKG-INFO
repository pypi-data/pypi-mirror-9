Description: Description
        ===========
        
        cplay-ng is a curses front-end for various audio players.  It aims to
        provide a power-user-friendly interface with simple filelist and playlist
        control. cplay-ng is written in Python and can use either pyncurses or the
        standard curses module.
        
        The original cplay is no longer maintained.  This fork aims to maintaining
        the original code as well as keeping it up to date with recent
        developments (e.g. python3) and adding new features.

        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            pip install cplay-ng
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            cplay-ng [ file | dir | playlist ] ...
        
        For a full list of command line options, see ``cplay-ng --help``.
        When in doubt about runtime controls, press 'h' for a friendly help page.
        
        Apart from cplay-ng, this distribution also includes the program
        cnq-ng to remote-control a running cplay-ng.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        If you would like to change options passed to the actual players just edit
        the ``PLAYERS`` list in the cplay-ng script or put the ``PLAYERS``
        definition in either ``~/.cplayrc`` or ``/etc/cplayrc``. If one of these
        files is available, it is executed by cplay-ng before initialization.
        
        Macros are defined using the ``MACRO`` dictionary, where the key is a key
        and the value is a string of cplay-ng input. For example, the following
        would make ``,d`` delete tagged (or current) files::
        
            MACRO['d'] = '!rm "$@"\n'
        
        Note, there is currently no version control for the rc-file!
        
        
        Miscellaneous
        =============
        
        A playlist can contain URLs, but the playlist itself will have to be
        local. For mpeg streaming, splay is recommended.
        
        It is also possible to pipe a playlist to cplay-ng, as stdin will be
        reopened on startup unless it is attached to a tty.
        
        Remote control is available via ``/var/tmp/cplay\_control-$USER``.
        Create this with mkfifo and see lircrc for examples.
        
        The shell command gets the full path of either all tagged items or the
        current item as positional arguments.
