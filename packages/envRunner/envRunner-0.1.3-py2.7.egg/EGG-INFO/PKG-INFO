Description: | envRunner is a command wrapper that provides configuration through
          environment variables. These variables can be set from a multitude of
          sources.
        | Examples:
          ``envRunner test.yml exec some_command params     envRunner test.json exec some_command params     envRunner http://test.com/test.yml exec some_command params     envRunner http://test.com/test.json exec some_command params``
        
        Each of the above will read the configuration file and then merge the
        values inside of that with the environment of the subprocess.
