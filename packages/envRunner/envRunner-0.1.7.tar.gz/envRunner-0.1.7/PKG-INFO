Description: | envRunner is a command wrapper that provides configuration through
          environment variables. These variables can be set from a multitude of
          sources.
        | Examples:
        
        ::
        
        
                envRunner  test.yml exec some_command params
                envRunner test.json exec some_command params
                envRunner http://test.com/test.yml exec some_command params
                envRunner http://test.com/test.json exec some_command params
        
        Each of the above will read the configuration file and then merge the
        values inside of that with the environment of the subprocess.

            Usage:
              envRunner (-h | --help) 
              envRunner <config> exec [COMMAND ...]                                                                                
            Options:
              -h --help   Shows this screen.
