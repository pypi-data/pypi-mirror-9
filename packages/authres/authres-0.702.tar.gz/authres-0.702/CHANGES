# Legend:
# --- = A new release
#   + = Added a feature (in a backwards compatible way)
#   ! = Changed something significant, or removed a feature
#   * = Fixed a bug, or made a minor improvement

--- 0.702 (2015-01-25 19:01 -0500)
  * Adjust examples and add discussion in the README about reporting SPF HELO
    and Mail From results correctly

--- 0.701 (2014-06-25 06:25 -0400)
  * Remove unintended artifacts from tarball

--- 0.700 (2014-06-25 06:12 -0400)
  + Add support for RFC 7281, Authentication-Results Registration for S/MIME
    Signature Verification, header field types
  * Minor improvements to setup.py
  * Updated README and docstrings to refer to RFC 7001 in addition to RFC 5451

--- 0.602 (2013-07-29 18:39)

  * Tolerate empty <pvalue>, such as in "smtp.mailfrom=".  RFC 5451, via
    RFC 2045, requires at least one character, but it seems more useful and
    only a minor violation of the spec to parse out an empty string rather
    than raising an exception.

--- 0.601 (2013-04-27 04:23)

  * When stringifying RFC 5451 property values (pvalue), format them as quoted-
    strings if they contain spaces or special characters (and are not e-mail
    addresses).  E.g., IPv6 addresses in policy.iprev properties must be
    double-quoted.
  * Fix broken references to quoted_string variable in authres.core.
    AuthenticationResultsHeader._parse_pvalue method.  (Closes: LP #1165978)
  * Fix erroneous reference to ArgumentError exception to refer to ValueError
    instead.  When does the Ruby compatiblity layer for Python come out?
  * Added additional tests/examples in authres/tests

--- 0.600 (2013-04-04 05:22)

  + Added support for DMARC as described in draft-kucherawy-dmarc-base-00

--- 0.501 (2013-02-11 20:17)

  * Make authres.dkim_b.DKIMAuthenticationResult inherit from authres.core.
    DKIMAuthenticationResult, not authres.core.AuthenticationResult.

--- 0.500 (2013-02-05 20:25)

  + Add match_signature methods to DKIMAuthenticationResult and DomainKeys-
    AuthenticationResult classes implementing matching against a DKIM/DK
    signature by d=, and, in the case of the authres.dkim_b module, b= (per
    RFC 6008, section 4).

--- 0.402 (2012-06-22 05:26)

  * Fix setup.py to install authres/tests (LP: #1007909)
  + Add AuthenticationResultsHeader.header_value() method.
  ! Moved doctest initiation from __init__.py to __main__.py so tests only run
    when the module is called as the main program

--- 0.401 (2012-04-13 20:27)

  * Fix MANIFEST.in to include correct files

--- 0.4 (2012-04-13 20:02)

  * Update note on use of fail instead of hardfail for SPF results now that
    the IANA registry has been updated and RFC 6577 published
  * Fix doctests to run when authres is imported
  ! No longer will run as main, which wasn't doing anything anyway
  * Split doctests and move most to authres/tests to make the docstrings
    bearable
  ! Changed pypi classifier for development status to production/stable

--- 0.399 (2012-02-09 06:15)

  + Added support for comments on headers where no authentication is performed
  + Added support in DKIMAuthenticationResults class for RFC 6008
    cryptographic identification header (header.b)
  + Added support for RFC 5617 DKIM ADSP authentication method in new
    DKIMADSPAuthenticationResult class
  + Added support for RFC 6212 Vouch By Reference (VBR) authentication method
    in new VBRAuthenticationResult class

--- 0.3 (2012-01-07 05:24)

  + Added support for comments on most header elements to object constructors.
    Comments are correctly stringified from constructed objects, however
    conversely, are not currently parsed from strings.
  ! The authres function and most object constructor signatures have changed in
    terms of argument order to allow for new comment arguments.  Using named
    arguments is recommended.
  * Added additional doctests from RFC 5451 examples

--- 0.2 (2011-08-10 16:50)

  ! Reworked API from scratch to be more properly OO, extendable, and
    maintainable
  + Parse authentication results headers
  ! Started rework of doctests to match new API and be more readable
  + Specific subclasses for creating and parsing dkim, domainKeys, spf,
    senderid, iprev, and smtp auth authentication methods

--- 0.1 (2011-03-14 18:00)

  + Initial release
  + Create authentication results headers
