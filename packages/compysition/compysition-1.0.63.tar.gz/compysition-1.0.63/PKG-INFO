Description: Compysition
        ========
        
        What?
        -----
        ::
        
        	A Python application framework to build and manage asynchronous and highly concurrent event-driven data flow
        
        I have created **compysition** to build off the simple way in which Wishbone_ managed message flow across multiple
        modules. Compysition expands upon this module registration method to provide abstracted multi-process communication
        via 0mq_, as well as the ability for full cyclical communication for in-process request/response behavior in a lightweight,
        fast, and fully concurrent manner, using gevent_ greenlets and concurrency patterns to consume and output events
        
        .. _0mq: http://zeromq.org/
        .. _Wishbone: https://github.com/smetj/wishbone
        .. _gevent: http://www.gevent.org
        
        **Compysition is currently new and in pre-Beta release. It will be undergoing many deep changes in the coming months**
        The **compysition** project is built upon the original work of the Wishbone_ project
        
        Variations from the traditional Actor Model
        -----
        
        The traditional and strict actor model requires that all actors have exactly one inbox and one outbox. I found that this was
        overly constraining for creating and crafting complex data flow models. So compysition inherently supports multiple inboxes
        and multiple outboxes on every single actor.
        
        To put it in actor model terms, every actor is also a "funnel" and a "fanout". 
        
        The default behavior, unless stated otherwise in the module documentation, is that all modules will send/copy an event to ALL
        connected outbox queues
        
        Full Circle WSGI Example
        -------
        
        For the example below, we want to execute an XML transformation on a request and send it back to the client in a fast
        and concurrent way. All steps and executions are spun up as spawned greenlet on the router
            
        .. code-block:: python
        
        	from compysition.router import Default
        	from compysition.module import WSGI
        	from compysition.module import BasicAuth
        	from compysition.module import Transformer
        	
        	from mymodules.module import SomeRequestExecutor
        	from myprojectresources import my_xsl_files as xsls
        	
        	router = Default()
        	router.registerModule(WSGIServer, "wsgi")
        	router.registerModule(BasicAuth, "auth")
        	router.registerModule(Transformer, "submit_transform", xsls['submit'])
        	router.registerModule(Transformer, "acknowledge_transform", my_xsl_files['acknowledge.xsl'])
        	router.registerModule(SomeRequestExecutor, "request_executor")
        	
        	router.connect('wsgi.outbox', 'auth.inbox')
        	router.connect('auth.outbox', 'submit_transform.inbox')
        	router.connect_error('auth.wsgi_error_outbox', 'wsgi.auth_errors') 			# Redirect auth errors to the wsgi server as a 401 Unaothorized Error
        	router.connect('submit_transform.outbox', 'request_executor.inbox')
        	router.connect_error('submit_transform.errors', 'wsgi.transformation_errors')
        	router.connect('request_executor.outbox', 'acknowledge_transform.inbox')
        	router.connect('acknowledge_transform.outbox', 'wsgi.acknowledge_inbox')
        	
        	router.start()
        	router.block()
        	
        Note how modular each component is. It allows us to configure any steps in between class method executions and add
        any additional executions, authorizations, or transformations in between the request and response by simply
        adding it into the message execution flow
        
        One-way messaging example
        -------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        	from compysition.router import Default
        	from compysition.module import TestEvent
        	from compysition.module import STDOUT
        
        	router = Default()
        	router.register(TestEvent, "event_generator", interval=1)
        	router.register(STDOUT, "output_one", prefix="I am number one: ", timestamp=True)
        	router.register(STDOUT, "output_two", prefix="I am number two: ", timestamp=True)
            
        	router.connect("event_generator.outbox_one_outbox", "output_one.inbox")
        	router.connect("event_generator.outbox_two_outbox", "output_two.inbox")
            
        	router.start()
        	router.block()
            	
        	Output: 
        		[2015-02-13 16:56:35.850659] I am number two: test
        		[2015-02-13 16:56:35.850913] I am number one: test
