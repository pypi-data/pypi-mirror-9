class XMLFilter(Actor):
    '''**A module that forwards or discards an event based on the presence/absence of or value of 
    a given xml path (or xslt transform) for the event XML data
    WARNING: Deprecated. Use EventRouter Instead**

    Parameters:

        - name (str):           The instance name.
        - xpath (str):          The xpath we wish to filter on. If this leads to an element and 'value' is also specified, the text of that element
                                    will be used to evaluate the provided value.
        - xslt_filepath (str):  (Default: None) The path of the xslt to apply to any given received XML PRIOR to applying the XPath lookup to test.
                                    The XML sent in the outboxes is NOT transformed.
        - value (str):          (Default: None) The value to filter on for the given xpath. 
                                    If unspecified the event will be forwarded if the given xpath element exists at all.
        - whitelist (bool):     (Default: False) Whether or not to use a whitelist for a given 'value'. 
                                    Setting this value to true will cause the module discard the event only if the element value equals the value given.
                                    If no value is set, and blacklist=True, the XMLFilter will discard the event if the xpath element DOES exist

        - filter_type (str):    (Default: delete) What to do with the filtered event. Possible actions are as follows:
                                        - delete: Deletes the event completely
                                        - output: Outputs the event to 'error' queues connected to the module
                                        - log   : Output the text of an event to a log message, using the given log_level
                                        
        - log_level (int):      (Default: 3) Only taken into account when the filter_type is log

        - delete_event (bool):  (Default: True) If true, the module will delete a filtered event. If False, it will attempt to send the event on any connected
                                    error queues.

    event = {
        'data': '<some_xml_data></some_xml_data>'

        'header': {
            'wsgi': {
                'request_id': 1
            }
        }
    }
