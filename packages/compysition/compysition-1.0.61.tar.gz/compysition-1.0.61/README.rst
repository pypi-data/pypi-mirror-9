Compysition
========

What?
-----
::

	A Python application framework to build and manage asynchronous and highly concurrent event-driven data flow

I have created **compysition** to build off the simple way in which Wishbone_ managed message flow across multiple
modules. Compysition expands upon this module registration module to provide abstracted multi-process communication
via 0mq_, as well as the ability for full cyclical communication for in-process request/response behavior in a lightweight,
fast, and fully concurrent manner, using gevent_ greenlets and concurrency patterns to consume and output events

.. _0mq: http://zeromq.org/
.. _Wishbone: https://github.com/smetj/wishbone
.. _gevent: http://www.gevent.org

**Compysition is currently new and in pre-Beta release. It will be undergoing many deep changes in the coming months**
The **compysition** project is built upon the original work of the Wishbone_ project

Variations from the traditional Actor Model
-----

The traditional and strict actor model requires that all actors have exactly one inbox and one outbox. I found that this was
overly constraining for creating and crafting complex data flow models. So compysition inherently supports multiple inboxes
and multiple outboxes on every single actor.

To put it in actor model terms, every actor is also a "funnel" and a "fanout". 

The default behavior, unless stated otherwise in the module documentation, is that all modules will send/copy an event to ALL
connected outbox queues

Full Circle WSGI Example
-------

For the example below, we want to execute an XML transformation on a request and send it back to the client in a fast
and concurrent way. All steps and executions are spun up as spawned greenlet on the router
    
.. code-block:: python

	from compysition.router import Default
	from compysition.module import WSGI
	from compysition.module import BasicAuth
	from compysition.module import Transformer
	
	from mymodules.module import SomeRequestExecutor
	from myprojectresources import my_xsl_files as xsls
	
	router = Default()
	router.registerModule(WSGIServer, "wsgi")
	router.registerModule(BasicAuth, "auth")
	router.registerModule(Transformer, "submit_transform", xsls['submit'])
	router.registerModule(Transformer, "acknowledge_transform", my_xsl_files['acknowledge.xsl'])
	router.registerModule(SomeRequestExecutor, "request_executor")
	
	router.connect('wsgi.outbox', 'auth.inbox')
	router.connect('auth.outbox', 'submit_transform.inbox')
	router.connect_error('auth.wsgi_error_outbox', 'wsgi.auth_errors') 			# Redirect auth errors to the wsgi server as a 401 Unaothorized Error
	router.connect('submit_transform.outbox', 'request_executor.inbox')
	router.connect_error('submit_transform.errors', 'wsgi.transformation_errors')
	router.connect('request_executor.outbox', 'acknowledge_transform.inbox')
	router.connect('acknowledge_transform.outbox', 'wsgi.acknowledge_inbox')
	
	router.start()
	router.block()
	
Note how modular each component is. It allows us to configure any steps in between class method executions and add
any additional executions, authorizations, or transformations in between the request and response by simply
adding it into the message execution flow

One-way messaging example
-------

.. code-block:: python

	from compysition.router import Default
	from compysition.module import TestEvent
	from compysition.module import STDOUT

	router = Default()
	router.register(TestEvent, "event_generator", interval=1)
	router.register(STDOUT, "output_one", prefix="I am number one: ", timestamp=True)
	router.register(STDOUT, "output_two", prefix="I am number two: ", timestamp=True)
    
	router.connect("event_generator.outbox_one_outbox", "output_one.inbox")
	router.connect("event_generator.outbox_two_outbox", "output_two.inbox")
    
	router.start()
	router.block()
    	
	Output: 
		[2015-02-13 16:56:35.850659] I am number two: test
		[2015-02-13 16:56:35.850913] I am number one: test
