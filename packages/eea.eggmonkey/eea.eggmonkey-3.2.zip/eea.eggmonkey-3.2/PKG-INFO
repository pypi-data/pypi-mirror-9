Description: ==============
        EEA Egg Monkey
        ==============
        
        This tools should be used together with zc.buildout, mr.developer and
        jarn.mkrelease. Its purpose is to automate a series of 10 steps that are
        required in order to produce and upload an egg on the eggrepo.
        
        The ten steps are:
        
        1. Bump version.txt to correct version; from -dev to final
        2. Update history file with release date; Record final release date
        3. Run "mkrelease -d eea" in package dir
        4. (Optional) Run "python setup.py sdist upload -r eea"
        5. Update versions.cfg file in buildout: svn up eea-buildout/versions.cfg
        6. Change version for package in eea-buildout/versions.cfg
        7. Commit versions.cfg file: svn commit versions.cfg
        8. Bump package version file; From final to +1-dev
        9. Update history file. Add Unreleased section
        10. SVN commit the dev version of the package.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        eea.eggmonkey requires python2.6
        
        Instalation
        ===========
        To use it, you need to add eea.eggmonkey as an extension to zc.buildout, for
        example:
        
        [buildout]
        
        extensions =
            mr.developer
            eea.eggmonkey
        
        parts =
            monkey
            ...
        
        Also, you need to add a new part (+ the python26 part, if you don't already
        have it):
        
        [monkey]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        eggs = eea.eggmonkey
        python = python26
        
        [python26]
        executable = /usr/bin/python2.6
        
        Usage
        -----
        Before you use it, you need to run bin/buildout (or bin/develop) at least once.
        This allows eggmonkey to learn about the sources and the packages in
        auto-checkout.
        
        After that, you can use the monkey script from bin. Learn about its parameters
        by running
        
        *  ``bin/monkey -h``
        
        Typical usage would be:
        
        * ``bin/monkey eea.indicators``
        
        You can specify multiple packages on the command line, they will all be
        processed:
        
        * ``bin/monkey eea.indicators eea.workflow eea.version``
        
        Or, if you want to release all eggs specified in the auto-checkout section of
        buildout:
        
        * ``bin/monkey -a``
        
        There is a special option that works around bugs in registering the egg with
        eggrepos and will run a "python sdist upload" operation, using the -u switch:
        
        * ``bin/monkey -u eea.indicators``
        
        If you're doing manual upload, you may need to specify a different python path,
        with the -p switch:
        
        * ``bin/monkey -u eea.indicators -p ~/tools/bin/python``
        
        If you need to specify the path to the mkrelease script, you can give it as an
        argument to the script, using the -m switch:
        
        * ``bin/monkey eea.indicators -m /path/to/bin/mkrelease``
        
        If you don't want to specify this path, place the mkrelease script in the PATH
        environment variable (typically this can be achieved by activating its
        virtualenv).
        
        Finally, if you're releasing eggs to a different repository, or if you have
        eggrepo.eea.europa.eu aliased as something different then "eea", you can
        manually specify this using the -d switch:
        
        * ``bin/monkey -d eeaeggs eea.indicators``
        
        If you want to forbid all network operations (for example,
        during testing), you can run
        
        * ``bin/monkey -n eea.indicators``
        
        
        If you want to skip versions.cfg update (for example running in a buildout without versions.cfg), you can run
        
        * ``bin/monkey -B eea.indicators``
        
        Providing defaults with a configuration file
        ============================================
        You can write a file ~/.eggmonkey in the following format:
        
        ::
        
            [*]
            python = /path/to/python
            mkrelease = /path/to/mkrelease
            manual_upload = true
            domain = eea
        
            [eea.indicators]
            domain = eea pypi
        
        This is a ConfigParser file format where each section is a package name, with
        the exception of the star (*), which provides defaults for all packages. The
        following options can be configured: python, mkrelease, manual_upload and
        domain. The domain option can be a space separated list of package repository
        aliases where the package will be uploaded.
        
        System requirements
        ===================
        Needs libsvn-dev and libaprutil1-dev (on Debian systems) and apr-util-devel,
        subversion-devel on Redhat systems
