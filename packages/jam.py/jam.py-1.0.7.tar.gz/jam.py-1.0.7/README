Jam.py is an event-driven framework for developing database applications:

- Web client-server database applications. The Server side uses Python
and Web.py library, the client side - JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap.

- Local desktop applications that use Python, Web.py, GTK+2 and PyGTK.

- Desktop client-server applications: The Server side uses Python and
Web.py library, the client side - Python, GTK+2 and PyGTK.

Currently, application development takes place in Administrator, which is
a desktop application written in Jam.py itself. So GTK+2 and PyGTK are
required to develop Jam.py applications. PyGtk is included in most Linux
distributions (http://www.pygtk.org/)

The don't repeat yourself (DRY) principle underlying the framework allows
a developer to focus on programming business logic and not waste time on
a routine work of programming interface and server details. That allows to
create feature rich, complex and robust applications.

Thanks for checking it out.

There is a demo project in the "demo" directory.
But first we recommend you to read the user guide in the "doc" directory.
