Changes
=======

0.6.0 (2015-03-17)
------------------

- feature: added application/json support. The new request json method returns
  the json formated data given from a request with content type applicaton/json.
  The raw content is stored in the request raw property if such json content
  is given.

- added OPTIONS to allwed request methods. This allows to handle cross origin
  request given from android phones during development. Note, you ned to
  register a view for handle such requests. We just added the OPTIONS as a
  general allowed request method.

- feature: use new testbrowser concept based on zope.testbrowser >= 5.0.0.
  This new testbrowser concept uses a wsgi application and is based on webtest.
  Currently we use p01.testbrowser which is a clone of zope.testbrowser because
  there is no zope.testbrowser release yet.

- feature: implemented simple JSONRPCTestProxy based on wsgi app. This new
  test json rpc proxy uses the wsgi application publisher for process a
  request.

- backport zope.publisher publication factory lookup. Improve the publication
  factory lookup by falling back to a more generic registration if the specific
  factory chooses not to handle the request after all


0.5.0 (2014-03-24)
