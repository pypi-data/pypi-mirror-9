Building
========

As mentioned above, this project uses zc.buildout, which requires a
few steps to build some necessary files.

The following two steps will create some necessary files, including a
bin directory.
% python bootstrap.py
% bin/buildout

Once built you can run all of the tests with:
% bin/test
