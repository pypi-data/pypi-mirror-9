version 0.3.0
-------------

- Divided colmet package into three parts

    collectors with ZeroMQ
  - colmet-collector : A collector that stores data received by ZeroMQ in a
    hdf5 file
  - colmet-common : Common colmet part.
- Added some parameters of ZeroMQ backend to prevent a memory overflow
