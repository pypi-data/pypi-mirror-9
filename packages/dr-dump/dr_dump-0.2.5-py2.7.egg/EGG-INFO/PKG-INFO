        This is a Django data dump script generator.
        
        It produces command line scripts usable within a Makefile or as a simple bash scripts to dump or load data with Django from the many app names you give it.
        
        It need a dependancies map to know what is required to be dumped.
        
        Maps
        ====
        
        Currently it only have two maps one for "djangocms-2" and one for "djangocms-3" projects, and so it only knows about:
        
        * Django contrib auth;
        * Django sites;
        * emencia.django.countries;
        * contact_form;
        * DjangoCMS and its common plugins;
        * Zinnia;
        * Porticus;
        * South;
        * django-tagging;
        * django-taggit;
        * easy-thumbnails;
        * django-filer;
        * django-google-tools;
        * emencia-django-socialaggregator;
        * emencia-django-slideshows;
        
        Note : Many app depends on Django's content types but we don't matter because it is automatically filled by Django and we should never try to dump/load it.
        
        Format
        ******
        
        * Dumps order does matter to respect module's dependancies;
        * model or dependancy names can be string or either a list of names, take care that string is splitted on white spaces, if you use excude flag like '-e' with your model names, allways use a list;
        * Circular dependancies is possible;
        
        Sample map : ::
        
            [
                ('DUMP_NAME_KEY', {
                    'use_natural_key': true,
                    'models': 'mymodel',
                    'dependancies': [],
                }),
            ]
        
        Where :
        
        DUMP_NAME_KEY
            Is the dump entry name, can be anything but commonly this is the app package name, this is what is used in embedded map files.
        use_natural_key
            A boolean to define if the dump can use natural key, if not defined, a dump entry is assumed to support natural key.
        models
            Is either a string of the model name or a list model names. Django accept either an app name from which it will take all its models, or a specific app model.
        dependancies
            Either a string of another dump names to depends of. They will be taken also even if they haven't been explicitely requested from user.
