Original game instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the role of our hero, Eric (or any other name you decide to call him and the
rest of the cast), you know that inside the staffroom safe are kept the school
reports. And, being Eric, you realise that you must at all costs remove your
report before it comes to the attention of the Headmaster.

The combination to the safe consists of four letters, each master knowing one
letter and the Headmaster's letter always coming first. To get hold of the
combination, you first have to hit all the shields hanging on the school walls.
Trouble is, this isn't as easy as it looks. Some of them can be hit by jumping
up. Others are more difficult. You could try and hit a shield by bouncing a
pellet off a master's head whilst he is sitting on the ground. Or, being Eric,
you may decide to knock over one of the boys and, whilst he's flattened, clamber
up on him so that you can jump higher.

OK. So all the shields are flashing wildly, disorientating the poor masters.
Knock them over now and, before they can stop themselves, they'll reveal their
letter of the code. All except for the history master, of course, who because of
his great age and poor eyesight can't be trusted to remember. His letter has
been implanted into his mind hypnotically. To make him reveal it, you must find
out the year he was born (which, in case you were wondering, changes each game).
Then, creep into a room before he gets there and, if the board is clean, write
it on the blackboard. When he goes into that room and sees his birthdate he
will, as if by post-hypnotic suggestion, give away his letter.

Now that you know all the letters of the combination, all you have to do is work
out which order they go in. You know that the Headmaster's letter is always
first, but as for the other three...you'll just have to try the various
possibilities. Find a clean blackboard and write out a combination.

Rush back to the staffroom and jump up to reach the safe with your hand. If
nothing happens, then the combination must be wrong, so you'd better find
another clean blackboard and try a different one.

With the safe open, your troubles still aren't over, as the flashing shields are
rather a giveaway. To stop them flashing, you now have to hit all of them again.

Done it? Congratulations! You are now allowed, along with all your friends, to
move on to the next class at school. But remember, there will be reports at the
end of this term...

School Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Boys shall attend lessons as shown in the timetable at the bottom of the screen.
(Remember that because you cheated in the exams last year, you always go to the
same lessons as the swot.)

Boys do not score points by attending lessons, but may be given lines if caught
in the wrong place.

Boys who acquire over 10,000 lines shall be expelled immediately from the
school.

Boys are not allowed to enter the staffroom or the Headmaster's study. Take
care.

At playtime, boys are supposed to be playing and not in any of the classrooms.

Boys shall not hit their schoolmates.

Original game instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Having managed to steal your report during the last few skooldaze of term,
you've spent the whole holiday forging teachers' signatures and handwriting to
make yourself look like the brightest, sweetest natured, most helpful little
soul ever to carry a satchel.

Now all you've got to do is get it back into the Head's safe...

A couple of years ago, your elder brother had exactly the same problem and has
lent you his old copy of the School Rules, on which he's scribbled some notes
in invisible ink. Holding the paper over a bonfire made from the swot's cap,
you can just make out the following:

* Key to safe round nek of gurls hedmistris. She hates frogs.
* Put frog in cup in gurls kitchin so you can nock it down onto her hed.
  Remmember the bike.
* Frogs ar kept in loked siense lab stor room. Combernasion letters held by
  masters - get them drunk.
* Sherry in hedmistris's cubord - only unloked wen sheez shure all the boys ar
  back in skool.

  catopult to nock cups onto masters.

Keys
----
The keys to move Eric around are:

* 'q' or up arrow - go up stairs, or continue walking in the same direction
* 'a' or down arrow - go down stairs, or continue walking in the same direction
* 'o' or left arrow - left
* 'p' or right arrow - right
* 'f' - fire catapult
* 'h' - hit
* 'j' - jump
* 's' - sit/stand
* 'w' - write on a blackboard (press Enter/Return to finish)

Eric always walks fast. In the original games Eric walked slow unless you held
down the shift key; I always held down the shift key, so didn't feel motivated
to include a 'slow mode'.

Other useful keys are:

* Escape - quit the game
* End - pause/resume
* Insert - take a screenshot
* F2 - save the game
* F6 - load the most recently saved game
* F11 - switch between full-screen and windowed mode
* F12 - show/hide the menu

Use the up and down arrow keys to move between items in the menu, and press
Enter or the space bar to execute a menu item.

Back to Skool mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Back to Skool mode also uses the following keys:

* 'c' - catch a mouse or frog
* 'd' - drop a stinkbomb
* 'g' - fire the water pistol
* 'm' - mount the bike
* 'o' - open a desk (while sitting at one)
* 'r' - release mice
* 't' - throw away the water pistol

To pedal the bike, use the left and right arrow keys (or 'o' and 'p'). Use the
up arrow key (or 'q') to stand on the saddle, and the down arrow key (or 'a')
to dismount. You can jump while standing on the saddle by pressing 'j' or the
up arrow key (or 'q').
