    choosing the output on which the surface has the biggest surface
    area.

    The client may specify a method to resolve a size conflict
    between the output size and the surface size - this is provided
    through the method parameter.

    The framerate parameter is used only when the method is set
    to "driver", to indicate the preferred framerate. A value of 0
    indicates that the app does not care about framerate.  The
    framerate is specified in mHz, that is framerate of 60000 is 60Hz.

    A method of "scale" or "driver" implies a scaling operation of
    the surface, either via a direct scaling operation or a change of
    the output mode. This will override any kind of output scaling, so
    that mapping a surface with a buffer size equal to the mode can
    fill the screen independent of buffer_scale.

    A method of "fill" means we don't scale up the buffer, however
    any output scale is applied. This means that you may run into
    an edge case where the application maps a buffer with the same
    size of the output mode but buffer_scale 1 (thus making a
    surface larger than the output). In this case it is allowed to
    downscale the results to fit the screen.

    The popup grab continues until the window is destroyed or a
