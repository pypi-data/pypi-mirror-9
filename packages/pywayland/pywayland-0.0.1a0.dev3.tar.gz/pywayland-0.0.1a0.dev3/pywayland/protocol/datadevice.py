    This request asks the compositor to start a drag-and-drop
    operation on behalf of the client.

    The source argument is the data source that provides the data
    for the eventual data transfer. If source is NULL, enter, leave
    and motion events are sent only to the client that initiated the
    drag and the client is expected to handle the data passing
    internally.

    The origin surface is the surface where the drag originates and
    the client must have an active implicit grab that matches the
    serial.

    The icon surface is an optional (can be NULL) surface that
    provides an icon to be moved around with the cursor.  Initially,
    the top-left corner of the icon surface is placed at the cursor
    hotspot, but subsequent :func:`Surface.attach() <pywayland.protocol.surface.Surface.attach>` request can move the
    relative position. Attach requests must be confirmed with
    :func:`Surface.commit() <pywayland.protocol.surface.Surface.commit>` as usual. The icon surface is given the role of
    a drag-and-drop icon. If the icon surface already has another role,
    it raises a protocol error.

    The current and pending input regions of the icon :class:`~pywayland.protocol.surface.Surface` are
    cleared, and :func:`Surface.set_input_region() <pywayland.protocol.surface.Surface.set_input_region>` is ignored until the
    :class:`~pywayland.protocol.surface.Surface` is no longer used as the icon surface. When the use
    as an icon ends, the current and pending input regions become
    undefined, and the :class:`~pywayland.protocol.surface.Surface` is unmapped.
