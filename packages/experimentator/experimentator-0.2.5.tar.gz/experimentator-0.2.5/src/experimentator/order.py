"""
This module contains the class |Ordering| and its descendants.
These classes handle how unique conditions at a particular experimental level are ordered and duplicated.
|Ordering| instances should be passed directly to the |Design| constructor;
there is no reason to otherwise interact with them in normal use.

Of special note are non-atomic orderings:
the class |NonAtomicOrdering| and its descendants.
''Non-atomic'' here means that the orderings between sections are not independent.
A |Shuffle| ordering is atomic;
the order in one section is independent of the order in another.
However, if one wants to ensure, for example, that possible block orders are evenly distributed among participants
(a |counterbalanced design|),
the block orders within each participants are not independent.
Each participant can decide its order of blocks only in the context of the other participants' block orders.
This means that the *parent* section must handle orderings
(in the example of counterbalanced blocks,
the |Experiment.base_section|--the experiment itself, essentially--must tell each participant what block order to use).

    LatinSquare


    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm constructs a stereotypical balanced Latin square,
    then shuffles the rows and elements (but not the columns).
    This algorithm is much faster than the algorithm used by |latin_square|.
    However, it does not sample from a uniform distribution of balanced Latin squares (i.e. it is biased)
    and it cannot create Latin squares that are both reduced and balanced.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> balanced_latin_square(6)
    [[0, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3],
     [5, 3, 2, 4, 0, 1],
     [1, 0, 4, 2, 3, 5],
     [2, 5, 0, 3, 1, 4],
     [4, 1, 3, 0, 5, 2],
     [3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 0]]  # random
