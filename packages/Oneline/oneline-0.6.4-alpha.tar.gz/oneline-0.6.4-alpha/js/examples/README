While running the files in this directory is possible
To run these files with best results,
you should move the js/html files to a public area on
a web server. You should also make sure the modules files
are in the modules folder and config files go in config. 
Before running make sure the config matches the settings
of your database.

Next view one of the files in your browser.
and if everything went right, you will see some
output.

Running geo examples

To run the geo examples, you should make sure the table in
configuration has 'lng' and 'lat fields, these are used
by the geo module and without it, it will throw an error

Running event examples

for events i've used an example that uses a field 'title'
you should make sure the db table has this field.

Other Notes:

- I've included multiple configs, each favouring different
  database families. 

- You'll find a sample dataset in this directory this should
  provide a very minimal collection of rows. For more examplar data run,
  bootstrap.sh (warning: this will take up 3~4 gbs) 

 - Client modules should be written in both coffeescript and
   plain old javascript, edit as you like.
