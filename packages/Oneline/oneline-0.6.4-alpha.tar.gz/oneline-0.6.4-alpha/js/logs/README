All oneline logging will be stored here. Logs are stored
in the following format: 

{module_name}_{date}.log

In each of these files you will find the errors, warnings
and client connection attempts and failures.
Each entry of the log follows this example:

[time] - {client_ip} - {object} - [what_happened]

A real example would be:

[9/4/2014 3:09PM] - 127.0.0.1 - Geolocation Object - No 'lng', 'lat' coordinates provided
