In this directory you will find some performance based tests
and unit tests. You can test the head 2 head performance of
BSON and JSON, or NoSQL and SQL. In both cases we found
the former performing better.

As like examples, these files should go in a directory on your
web server, afterwards can be opened inside a browser.

The SQL vs NoSQL example uses mongodb and mysql. For a
more head 2 head example using (your databases) you can
replace with postgres and couchdb.

Unit tests can be found in ./unit_tests.html these
are general purpose tests to measure oneline's productivity.
Should any test fail, please email me @ matrix.nad@gmail.com
