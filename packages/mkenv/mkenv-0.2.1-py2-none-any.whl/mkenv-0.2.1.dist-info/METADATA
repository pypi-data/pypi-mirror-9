mkenv
=====

mkenv is a simpler tool for creating virtualenvs in a central location.

It consists of the 5% of `virtualenvwrapper
<https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ that I actually use,
and is in some ways meant to complement ``virtualenv`` rather than completely
wrapping or hiding it.


Installation
------------

The usual::

    $ pip install mkenv


Usage
-----

Usage is similar to ``mkvirtualenv``, although ``mkenv`` passes
arguments directly through to ``virtualenv``::

    $ mkenv nameofvenv -- -p pypy

will create a virtual environment in an appropriate platform-specific
data directory, or in the directory specified by ``WORKON_HOME`` for
compatibility.


Temporary Virtualenvs
---------------------

I also find ``mktmpenv`` useful for quick testing. To support its use case,
``mkenv`` currently supports a different but similar style of temporary
virtualenv.

Invoking::

    $ venv=$(mkenv -t)

in your shell will create (or re-create) a global temporary virtualenv,
and print its ``bin/`` subdirectory (which in this case will be then
stored in the ``venv`` variable). It can subsequently be used by, e.g.::

    $ $venv/python

or::

    $ $venv/pip ...

et cetera.

The global virtualenv is cleared each time you invoke ``mkenv -t``.
Unless you care, unlike virtualenvwrapper's ``mktmpenv``, there's no
need to care about cleaning it up, whenever it matters for the next
time, it will be cleared and overwritten.

``mkenv`` may support the more similar "traditional" one-use virtualenv in the
future, but given that it does not activate virtualenvs by default (see below),
the current recommendation for this use case would be to simply use the
``virtualenv`` binary directly.


Why don't I use virtualenvwrapper?
----------------------------------

``virtualenvwrapper`` is great! I've used it for a few years. But I've
slowly settled on a much smaller subset of its functionality that I like
to use. Specifically:

    * I don't like activating virtualenvs.

      virtualenvs are magical and hacky enough on their own, and piling
      activation on top just makes things even more messy, especially
      if you're moving around between different projects in a shell.
      Some people use ``cd`` tricks to solve this, but I just want
      simiplicity.

    * I don't need project support.

      I've never attached a project to a virtualenv. I just use a naming
      convention, naming the virtualenv with the name of the repo (with simple
      coersion), and then using `dynamic directory expansion in my shell
      <https://github.com/Julian/dotfiles/blob/51bb47e/.config/zsh/.zshrc#L57-L80>`_
      to handle association.

Basically, I just want a thing that is managing a central repository of
virtualenvs for me. So that's what ``mkenv`` does!
