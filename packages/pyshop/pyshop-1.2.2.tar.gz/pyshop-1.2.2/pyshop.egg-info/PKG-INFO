        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        Pyshop is a private repository for python packages.
        
        The aim is to split private projects in distinct private packages and keep a
        setup.py clean and working, by declaring all dependencies, exactly as public
        packages on PyPI.
        
        Pyshop also proxies and caches packages from PyPI safely using SSL and checking server
        certificate.
        
        Pyshop uses clear and simple ACLs to manage privileges:
        
        - an installer group that can only download release files,
        - a developer group that can download and upload release files and browse the
          website,
        - an admin group that has developer privileges and accounts management.
        
        Since pyshop is intended to host private packages, every user, including *pip*,
        must be authenticated by login and password.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            $ virtualenv pyshop
            $ cd pyshop
            (pyshop)$ source bin/activate
            (pyshop)$ pip install pyshop[waitress]
            (pyshop)$ cp pyshop.sample.ini pyshop.ini
            (pyshop)$ vim pyshop.ini  # change the pyshop.cookie_key setting
            (pyshop)$ pyshop_setup pyshop.ini
            (pyshop)$ pserve pyshop.ini start --log-file=pyshop.log
        
        You should edit the pyshop.ini file in order to configure the
        ``pyshop.cookie_key`` and the host:port that hosts the service. When the server
        is running visit the website, http://localhost:8000/ by default, to check
        everything is fine.
        
        For production usage, you should create accounts with the *developer* group.
        Visit http://localhost:8000/pyshop/user with the admin account to create
        accounts.
        
        You also should also use an https reverse proxy. Python packaging core uses
        HTTP basic authentication: it sends user/password in clear.
        
        The pythop.sample.ini file use waitress as the default WSGI server, but,
        if you are familiar with another WSGI server that support paste format,
        you could use it.
        
        
        Configuring your environment
        ============================
        
        Here are all configuration files you will need to modify for usual python tools
        to use your newly deployed private repository.
        
        ~/.pip/pip.conf
        ---------------
        
        Configuration used by pip. This is a user file, you can set a developer or
        the generic pip account.
        
        ::
        
            [global]
            # when mirroring a package, pyshop retrieves information from PyPI and
            # stores it in its database. Be patient, it is not so long.
            default-timeout = 120
            timeout = 120
        
            [install]
            index-url = http://pip:changeme@localhost:8000/simple/
        
            [search]
            index = http://pip:changeme@localhost:8000/pypi
        
        
        .. note::
        
          If you are using a WSGI server that kills requests if it is too long, like
          uWSGI or gunicorn, set an appropriate timeout for this service too.
        
        setup.cfg and pydistutils.cfg
        -----------------------------
        
        setup.cfg and pydistutils.cfg are used when running *python setup.py develop*
        to install your package or when using *easy_install*. You should use a generic
        account with installer privileges only, shared by all developers.
        
        This setting can be set per project or in user ``$HOME`` (see
        `setuptools documentation`_ for details)
        
        .. _`setuptools documentation`:  https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/easy_install.html#configuration-files
        
        ::
        
            [easy_install]
            index-url = http://pip:changeme@localhost:8000/simple/
        
        This should work now::
        
            python setup.py develop
        
        ~/.pypirc
        ---------
        
        Configuration used by setuptools to upload files.
        All developers should have this configuration in their ``$HOME`` to upload
        packages.
        
        ::
        
            [distutils]
            index-servers =
                pyshop
        
            [pyshop]
            username: admin  # or create an account in pyshop admin interface
            password: changeme
            repository: http://localhost:8000/simple/
        
        This should work now::
        
            python setup.py sdist upload -v -r pyshop
