xaml -- XML Abstract Markup Language
====================================

an easier way for humans to write xml

if a line starts with any xaml component ( % @ . # $ ) that line represents an xml element
  - an element continues until eol, or an unquoted :
  - an element can be continued to the next line(s) using unquoted parens

elif a line starts with a : it is specifying how the following lines should be interpreted:
  - :python -> python code
  - :markdown -> markdown text (not implemented)
  - :css -> css styles (not implemented)

else the line represents the content of the xml element and cannot contain other nested elements

xaml components:

    % -> element name
    @ -> name attribute
    . -> class attribute
    # -> id attribute
    $ -> string attribute (_ to ' ' conversion not implemented)

    e.g. %document .bold #doc_1 @AutoBiography $My_Biography ->
         <document class="bold" id="doc_1" name="AutoBiography" string="My Biography"/>
