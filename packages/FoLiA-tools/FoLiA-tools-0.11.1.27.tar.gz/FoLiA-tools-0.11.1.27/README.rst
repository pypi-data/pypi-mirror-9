FoLiA: Format for Linguistic Annotation
=======================================

FoLiA is an XML-based annotation format, suitable for the representation
of linguistically annotated language resources. FoLiA’s intended use is
as a format for storing and/or exchanging language resources, including
corpora. Our aim is to introduce a single rich format that can
accommodate a wide variety of linguistic annotation types through a
single generalised paradigm. We do not commit to any label set, language
or linguistic theory. This is always left to the developer of the
language resource, and provides maximum flexibility.

XML is an inherently hierarchic format. FoLiA does justice to this by
maximally utilising a hierarchic, inline, setup. We inherit from the
D-Coi format, which posits to be loosely based on a minimal subset of
TEI. Because of the introduction of a new and much broader paradigm,
FoLiA is not backwards-compatible with D-Coi, i.e. validators for D-Coi
will not accept FoLiA XML. It is however easy to convert FoLiA to less
complex or verbose formats such as the D-Coi format, or plain-text.
Converters are provided.

The main characteristics of FoLiA are:

-  **Generalised paradigm** - We use a generalised paradigm, with as few
   ad-hoc provisions for annotation types as possible.
-  **Expressivity** - The format is highly expressive, annotations can
   be expressed in great detail and with flexibility to the user’s
   needs, without forcing unwanted details. Moreover, FoLiA has
   generalised support for representing annotation alternatives, and
   annotation metadata such as information on annotator, time of
   annotation, and annotation confidence.
-  **Extensible** - Due to the generalised paradigm and the fact that
   the format does not commit to any label set, FoLiA is fairly easily
   extensible.
-  **Formalised** - The format is formalised, and can be validated on
   both a shallow and a deep level (the latter including tagset
   validation), and easily machine parsable, for which tools are
   provided.
-  **Practical** - FoLiA has been developed in a bottom-up fashion right
   alongside applications, libraries, and other toolkits and converters.
   Whilst the format is rich, we try to maintain it as simple and
   straightforward as possible, minimising the learning curve and making
   it easy to adopt FoLiA in practical applications.

The FoLiA format makes mixed-use of inline and stand-off annotation.
Inline annotation is used for annotations pertaining to single tokens,
whilst stand-off annotation in a separate annotation layers is adopted
for annotation types that span over multiple tokens. This provides FoLiA
with the necessary flexibility and extensibility to deal with various
kinds of annotations.

Notable features are:

-  XML-based, UTF-8 encoded
-  Language and tagset independent
-  Can encode both tokenised as well as untokenised text + partial
   reconstructability of untokenised form even after tokenisation.
-  Generalised paradigm, extensible and flexible
-  Provenance support for all linguistic annotations: annotator, type
   (automatic or manual), time.
-  Used by various software projects and corpora, especially in the
   Dutch-Flemish NLP community
