This program allows one to convert a Roundup issue tracker instance to Bitbucket's issue tracker. Point it to the directory containing the database, and it will generate a ZIP-file which you can import from the Bitbuckets issue tracker settings page.

python3.4 roundup2bitbucket.py /path/to/roundup/trackers/project issues.zip

Currently, the issues are converted, including the attached messages with their creation dates. All attached files are also included and linked to the correct issues.

The history of changes of the states of issues, the title of issues is not preserved. Furthermore, timezones are not taken into account.


It was tested using Python 3.4 and requires no external packages.
