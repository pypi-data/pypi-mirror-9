"""
This module contains variables with global |fortpy| settings. To change the
behavior of |fortpy|, change the variables defined in :mod:`fortpy.settings`.

Plugins should expose an interface so that the user can adjust the
configuration.

Example usage::

    from fortpy import settings
    settings.case_insensitive_completion = True

Completion output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autodata:: case_insensitive_completion
.. autodata:: add_bracket_after_function
.. autodata:: no_completion_duplicates

Filesystem cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autodata:: cache_directory
.. autodata:: use_filesystem_cache

Parser
~~~~~~

.. autodata:: real_time_update

Dynamic stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autodata:: dynamic_params

Recursions
~~~~~~~~~~

First off there is a global limit :data:`max_executions`. This limit 
is important, to set a maximum amount of time, the completion may use.

The default values are based on experiments while completing the |fortpy| library
itself (inception!). These settings make the completion
definitely worse in some cases. But a completion should also be fast.

Adds an opening bracket after a function, because that's normal behaviour.
Removed it again, because in VIM that is not very practical.

If set, completions with the same name don't appear in the output anymore,

Use the fast parser. This means that reparsing is only being done if
something has been changed e.g. to a function. If this happens, only the
function is being reparsed.

the params of a function.

This limit is probably the most important one, because if this limit is
exceeded, functions can only be one time executed. So new functions will be
executed, complex recursions with the same functions again and again, are
ignored.

max_function_recursion_level = 5
"""
`max_function_recursion_level` is more about whether the recursions are
stopped in deepth or in width. The ratio beetween this and
`max_until_execution_unique` is important here. It stops a recursion (after
the number of function calls in the recursion), if it was already used
earlier.
