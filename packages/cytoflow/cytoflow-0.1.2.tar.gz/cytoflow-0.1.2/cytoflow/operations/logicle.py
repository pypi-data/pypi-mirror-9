class LogicleTransformOp(HasTraits):
    """An implementation of the Logicle scaling method.
    
    This scaling method implements a "linear-like" region around 0, and a
    "log-like" region for large values, with a very smooth transition between
    them.  It's particularly good for compensated data, and data where you have
    "negative" events (events with a fluorescence of ~0.)
    
    If you don't have any data around 0, you might be better of with a more
    traditional log scale or a Hyperlog.
    
    .. warning: THIS CODE CURRENTLY CALLS A SWIG-WRAPPED C++ LIBRARY (from
                the second reference, below.)  Because I haven't figured
                out the distribution/packaging issues yet, it is currently
                NOT imported when you `import cytoflow`.  If you want to
                try it (it's cool!), edit __init__.py and uncomment the
                `import Logicle....` line; and then you'll have to build the
                C++ sources (included in the repo.)
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    name : Str 
        the name of this operation
    channels : ListStr 
        the channels on which to apply the operation
    T : dict(Str : float)
        for each channel, the maximum data value for this channel.  
        On a BD instrument, 2^18.
    W : dict(Str : float)
        for each channel, the width of the linear range, in log10 decades.  
        can estimate, or use a fixed value like 0.5.
    A : dict(Str : float) 
        for each channel, additional decades of negative data to include.  
        the display usually captures all the data, so 0 is fine to start.
    r : Float
        if estimating W, the quantile of negative data used to estimate W.  
        default 0.05 is a good choice.
