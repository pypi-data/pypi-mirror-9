        =============
        
        A collection of utilities of everyday use when writing
        Python 2.7 code or Django projects.
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This package is used by several living projects. The individual utilities
        contained are usually not depending on each other. Their layout and API
        are considered stable honouring the backward compatibility.
        
        The project is divided into two sections:
        
        * **General Python stuff**
        * **Django-related utils** - located in the ``django`` package
        
        The code is documented, please find the description and examples
        in the docstring of each utility.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install either using pip::
        
            pip install useful
        
        Or using e-i::
        
            easy_install useful
        
        Or from source::
        
            git clone https://github.com/tuttle/python-useful src/useful
            cd src/useful
            python setup.py develop
        
        If you are about to use the Django features like the templatetags,
        you can add to ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'useful.django',
            )
        
        Please file an Issue on GitHub if you have bugreport, tip, anything.
        Thank you!
