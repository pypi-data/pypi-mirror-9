Description: *********************************
        CFFI bindings to the CMPH library
        *********************************
        
        These bindings provide python with the ability to create and use 
        `Minimal Perfect Hashes`_ via the CMPH_ library.

        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        Should be as simple as 
        
        .. code-block:: bash
            
            $ pip install cmph-cffi
        
        
        -------------------
        Development version
        -------------------
        
        The **latest development version** can be installed directly from GitHub:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install --upgrade 'git+https://github.com/URXtech/cmph-cffi'
        
        
        =====
        Usage
        =====
        
        Creating a new MPH
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import cmph
            with open('/usr/share/dict/words', 'w') as keys:
                mph = cmph.generate_hash(keys)
        
        Getting keys out of an MPH
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            mph('Test')
        
        .. warning:: Be aware that whilst MPH's are awesome, they typically cannot
           distinguish between keys they are built on and unseen keys. Concretely this
           means that feeding in keys that are not in the original key set will have
           **undefined results**
        
        Saving the MPH
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            with open('/tmp/out.mph', 'w') as out_file:
                mph.save(out_file)
        
        Loading a pre-existing MPH
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            with open('/tmp/out.mph') as in_file:
                cmph.load_hash(in_file)
