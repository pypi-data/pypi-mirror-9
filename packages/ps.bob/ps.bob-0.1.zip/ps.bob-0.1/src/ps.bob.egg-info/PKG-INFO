        Addons created with ``ps.bob`` are tested to work in Plone 4.3.x.
        They should also work with other versions but that was not tested.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Use in a buildout
        -----------------
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
            parts += mrbob
        
            [mrbob]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs =
                mr.bob
                ps.bob
        
        If you want to use the latest development version from GitHub, add ``ps.bob`` to your ``mr.developer`` source section::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions += mr.developer
        
            [sources]
            ps.bob = git git://github.com/propertyshelf/ps.bob.git
        
        
        This creates a mrbob-executeable in your bin-directory.
        Call it from the ``src``-directory of your project like this.::
        
            $ ../bin/mrbob ps.bob:diazo_theme
