= Bitmask Release Checklist (*) =
  * [ ] Check that all tests are passing!
  * [ ] Check that the version in bitmask_client/pkg/linux/bitmask-root is bumped if needed.
  * [ ] Tag everything
    * Should be done for the following packages, in order:
      * [ ] 1. leap.common
      * [ ] 2. leap.keymanager
      * [ ] 3. leap.soledad
      * [ ] 4. leap.mail
      * [ ] 5. leap.bitmask
      * [ ] 6. leap.mx
    * NOTE: It's assumed that origin is the leap.se repo
    * [ ] git fetch origin
    * [ ] git tag -l, and see the latest tagged version (unless it's not a minor version bump, in which case, just bump to it)
    * [ ] Checkout release-X.Y.Z (locally, never pushed)
    * [ ] Update relnotes.txt in leap.bitmask if needed.

    * [ ] Review pkg/requirements.pip for everything and update if needed (that's why the order).
          - See whatever has been introduced in changes/VERSION_COMPAT
          - Reset changes/VERSION_COMPAT
    * [ ] git commit -av  # we should add a commit message here...

    * [ ] Fold in changes files into the CHANGELOG
          - NOTE: For leap.soledad, the CHANGELOG entries should be divided per package (common, client, server). See older releases for reference.
          - Helper bash line: for i in $(ls changes); do cat changes/$i; echo; done
    * [ ] git rm changes/feature*; git rm changes/bug*
    * [ ] git commit -m "Fold in changes."

    * [ ] git checkout master && git pull origin master && git merge --no-ff release-X.Y.Z --no-edit
    * [ ] git tag -s X.Y.Z -m "Tag <package> version X.Y.Z" # (note the -s so that it's a signed tag and -m to specify the message for the tag)
    * [ ] git push origin master; git push origin X.Y.Z
    * [ ] git checkout develop && git merge master && git push origin develop
  * [ ] Build and upload bundles
    * [ ] Use the scripts under pkg/<os>/ to build the the bundles.
    * [ ] Sign them with gpg -a --sign --detach-sign <path/to/bundle>
    * [ ] Upload bundle and signature to downloads.leap.se/client/<os>/Bitmask-<os>-<ver>.(tar.bz2,dmg,zip)
    * [ ] Update symbolic link for latest upload and signature:
    	* [ ] ~/public/client/Bitmask-<os>-latest
    	* [ ] ~/public/client/Bitmask-<os>-latest.asc
  * [ ] Announce
    * [ ] Mail leap@lists.riseup.net
