SYNOPSIS
========

bitmask [-h] [-d] [-l [LOG FILE]] [--openvpn-verbosity [OPENVPN_VERB]]

DESCRIPTION
===========

*bitmask* is a graphical client to control LEAP, the encrypted internet access toolkit.

When launched, it places an icon in the system tray from where the LEAP services can be controlled.


OPTIONS
=======

general options
---------------

**-h, --help**                  Print a help message and exit.

**-l, --logfile=<file>**        Writes log to file. 

**-s, --standalone**          Makes Bitmask use standalone directories for configuration and binary searching.

**-V, --version**             Displays Bitmask version and exits.


openvpn options
---------------

**--openvpn-verbosity** [0-5]   Verbosity level for openvpn logs.

debug options
-------------
**-d, --debug**                 Launches client in debug mode, writing debug info to stdout.

**--danger**                    Bypasses the certificate check for bootstrap. This open the possibility of MITM attacks, so use only to debug providers in controlled environments, and never in production.

ENCRYPTED MAIL
==============

Bitmask now (since version 0.3.0) supports the encrypted mail service with providers that offer it.

Mail client configuration
-------------------------

To be able to use the mail services, you should configure your mail client to
talk to the following ports:

**STMP**:                       localhost:2013

**IMAP**:                       localhost:1984

For the time being, we have successfully tested this functionality in thunderbird.

Mail poll period
----------------

If you want to change the default polling time for fetching mail, you can use
a environment variable: BITMASK_MAILCHECK_PERIOD

WARNING
=======

This software is still in its early phases of testing. So don't trust your life to it!
