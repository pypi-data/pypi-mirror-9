~~~~~~~~~~

Provide some really basic stats functions, such as mean/average,
median, variance, the basics. A couple more advanced measures, such as
skewness, kurtosis, and median absolute deviation are also provided,
but if a project needs any more than the functions below, I'd strongly
recommend investigating ``scipy.stats`` or some other NumPy-based
statistics package.

(Note that all functions default to 0.0 when passed no values, which,
while not totally accurate, has usually worked out fine for basic
usage.)

A note on statistical moments
-----------------------------

Most people are probably familiar with the concept of the "mean" or
"average", which gives a sort of quantitiative "middle-ish" value by
which a sample can be can be generalized. But the mean is just the
first of four ways a sample or distribution can be described:

Statistical moments and what they generally describe:

1. Average - theoretical middle value
2. Variance - width of value dispersion
3. Skewness - symmetry of distribution
4. Kurtosis - "peakiness" or long-tailed-ness

For more information it's probably best to read a bit of Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)

Keep in mind that while these moments can give a bit more insight into
the shape and distribution of data, they do not guarantee a complete
picture. Wildly different datasets can have the same values for all
four moments, so generalize wisely. (And read up on robust statistics
and scipy.stats)
