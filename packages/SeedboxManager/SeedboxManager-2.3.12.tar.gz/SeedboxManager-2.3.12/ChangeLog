0.1.20

------

* Reduced excess info logging to avoid growing logs while in cron mode. Added validate_phase plugin. The new plugin will make sure all torrents are in the proper state before allowing them to continue to the next phase. Optimized torrentparser; added dependency on Bittorrent-bencode as after performance testing it was substantially more efficient but also stricter. Therefore it will work 98% of the time and the remaiing 2% of the time we'll leverage the custom parser to extract files associated with torrent

0.1.14
------

* bumping version for next upload
* added patch to make sure using loglevel option was case insensitive
* added unittest for action module and resulted in bug fixes

* updated README; added new required attribute to configfile

0.1.3

0.1.1
-----

* forgot to include ez_setup.py in distribution
* no longer needed with setuptools model
* Changes to support packaging and distribution
* added LICENSE; MIT
* removed logfile option from filesync given it is now redundant since logging from the subprocess is now directly supported
* subprocess module will output to stdout/stderr but I wanted everything consistently going to logging so it can be properly controlled. So I added an extension to subprocess to handle attaching logging to the child process and created unit testing for the new module. Then updated filesync which uses rsync for remote syncing of files to leverage new module
* updated distribution related files
* deleted old test files since they are replaced will real unit test modules
* added sample config files to support testing

* Initial creation
* Initial commit
