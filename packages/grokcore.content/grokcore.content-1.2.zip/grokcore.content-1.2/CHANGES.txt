Changes
=======

1.2 (2015-04-01)
----------------

- Introduce ObjectEditedEvent which is meant to used when the
  attribute of an object are edited. This makes possible to easily
  distinguish it from generic and container modification operations.

- Fix a bug where the OrderedContainer could get corrupted in case
  updateOrder() would have been called with a list containing multiple
  occurrences of a existing key in the mapping.

1.1 (2010-11-01)
----------------

- Use newer grokcore.component.

- Made package comply to zope.org repository policy.

1.0 (2010-02-06)
----------------

- Created ``grokcore.content`` in January 2010 by factoring basic
  component base classes out of Grok.
