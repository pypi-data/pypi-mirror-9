        1.2 (2015-04-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Introduce ObjectEditedEvent which is meant to used when the
          attribute of an object are edited. This makes possible to easily
          distinguish it from generic and container modification operations.
        
        - Fix a bug where the OrderedContainer could get corrupted in case
          updateOrder() would have been called with a list containing multiple
          occurrences of a existing key in the mapping.
        
        1.1 (2010-11-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Use newer grokcore.component.
        
        - Made package comply to zope.org repository policy.
        
        1.0 (2010-02-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Created ``grokcore.content`` in January 2010 by factoring basic
          component base classes out of Grok.
