Description: Python type checking for annotated function signatures.
        
        This will raise SyntaxErrors if you use it with Python2, however, there are no
        checks in place to prevent you from trying (maybe the syntax will be backported
        someday, who knows).
        
        Usage is through the wrap @type_checked and configuration through the static
        object Config.
        
        Please see the tests in the test directory or the README.md for usage examples.
