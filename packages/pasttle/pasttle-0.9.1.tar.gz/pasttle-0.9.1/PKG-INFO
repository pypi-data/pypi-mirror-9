        Overview
        ========
        
        Pasttle is based upon http://sprunge.us, born out of the necessity to:
        
        * Have a lightweight pastebin software
        * Not depend on Google AE
        * Paste via CLI
        
        Also, I wanted to play more with http://bottlepy.org
        
        Pasttle is split in server and client, it depends on what you are trying to 
        use to run one or the other.
        
        * Server: Runs on python and needs a database (defaults to using SQLite) to
          store all the data. You want this if you are setting your own private 
          pasttle instance
        * Client: Entirely written in bash. These are just thin wrappers around curl,
          you can use this to post to a pasttle server
        
        
        Installing/Upgrading pasttle-server
        ===================================
        
        .. note::
        
           If you are upgrading pasttle-server, you'd do well in reading CHANGELOG.rst
           first so you make sure the version you are upgrading has any additional
           steps.
        
        Pasttle is part of PyPI, you can just:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install pasttle
        
        ... and it should pull all the necessary components. Whether you want to install
        it in a virtual environment (which I recommend) or system-wide is totally up
        to you.
        
        If you instead want to try from source code (i.e. by cloning the git repo) 
        then I suggest you execute:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python setup.py install
        
        ... and be done with it. Again, if you do this in a virtual environment or
        not is up to you.
        
        In either case, if you want to add any other database drivers on top of the
        shipped SQLite driver, you need to install it separately depending on what
        method you used to install pasttle to begin with.
        
        
        Running the server
        ==================
        
        Once you have it installed you need a database and (optionally) a different 
        WSGI runner (bottle, which pasttle runs on top of, runs on wsgiref by default) 
        but can run on Paste, tornado, CherryPy, and several others.
        
        Also, since pasttle uses SQLAlchemy as the backend, you have your pick of any 
        database that SQLAlchemy supports: SQLite (the default), MySQL and Postgres 
        being the most famous.
        
        Once you have your database all setup, you just need to create a pasttle.ini 
        (like the one in the repo) and change the values to whatever matches your 
        environment. 
        
        After that:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pasttle-server.py
        
        Should start the server. If you want to use a different config file, just set 
        the environment variable ``PASTTLECONF`` to the file you want to read before 
        starting the server, like this:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           export PASTTLECONF=/etc/pasttle/mypasttle.ini
           pasttle-server.py
           # optionally, specify a different config section, e.g. [development]
           export PASTTLECONF=/etc/pasttle/mypasttle.ini:development
           pasttle-server.py
        
        
        Running the client
        ==================
        
        Running the client just requires 2 steps:
        
        * Source pasttle.bashrc
        * Run ``pasttle -h`` or ``gettle -h`` to check usage
