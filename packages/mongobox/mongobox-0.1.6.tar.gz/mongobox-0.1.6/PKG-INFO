Description: Mongo Box
        ---------
        
        Mongo Box helps starting and stopping sandboxed MongoDB instance
        from within a Python process. MongoDB instance is created with a
        temporary directory to store database file and is configured to
        be as lightweight as possible. It will choose a free port on localhost, 
        so it will not interfere with default MongoDB processes. 
        It is primarily expected to be used in unit tests and for prototyping concepts.
        
        A typical use of a Mongo Box:
        
        ```python
        from mongobox import MongoBox
        
        box = MongoBox()
        box.start()
        
        client = box.client() # pymongo client 
        assert client.alive()
        
        # do stuff with Mongo
        
        box.stop()
        assert not client.alive()
        ```
        
        Nose 1
        ------
        
        Mongo Box comes with a Nose plugin which is automatically installed.
        If used as a plugin, port of the running instance will be exported
        in environment variable `MONGOBOX_PORT`. This name can be overridden
        in settings.
        
        The plugin exposes several configuration options. To see them, run:
        
            nosetests --help
        
        The options you are interested in start with `--mongobox-`.
        
        Nose 2
        ------
        
        `nose2.cfg` should look similar to this:
        
        ```ini
        [unittest]
        plugins = mongobox.nose2_plugin
        
        [mongobox]
        # Optionally specify the path to the mongod executable
        # bin =
        # Optionally specify the port to run mongodb on
        # port =
        # Optionally enable mongodb script engine
        # scripting = True
        # Path to database files directory. Creates temporary directory by default
        # dbpath =
        # Optionally store the mongodb log here (default is /dev/null)
        # logpath =
        # Optionally preallocate db files
        # prealloc = True
        # Which environment variable port number will be exported to
        port_envvar = MONGOBOX_PORT
        ```
        
        Unit tests
        ----------
        
        For an easy unit tests integration there is a `MongoTestCase` class
        inherited from `unittest.TestCase`. It assumes tests are run from `nosetests`
        with `--with-mongobox` flag. `MongoTestCases` provides a `pymongo` client
        connected to the sandboxed mongo instance and a `purge_database` helper
        to clean up the database after every test:
        
        ```python
        from mongobox.unittest import MongoTestCase
        
        class MyTest(MongoTestCase):
            def setUp(self):
                deploy_fixtures(self.mongo_client)
        
            def tearDown(self):
                self.purge_database()
        ```
