Description: 
        Although Ansible is a powerful tool for configuration management, debugging its
        playbook is often bothersome. One of its reasons is an error message from
        ansible may not include enough information for debug. For example, variables and
        task's keywords are not included usually. Another reason is the time it takes to
        run a playbook. It may take a long time, and you may need to run the playbook
        several times to get more details and to see that the bug is fixed.
        
        ansible-playbook-debugger is the debugger to facilitate such a bothersome work.
        When a task fails, the debugger is invoked automatically. Then you can check
        the module's arguments, variables, keywords, and so on. Furthermore, you can
        change the module's arguments to fix a bug, and re-execute the task. If the
        re-execution is successful, the playbook continues to run as if there was no
        error.
