`pydocusign` is a Python client for `DocuSign`_ signature SAAS platform.


**************
Project status
**************

`pydocusign` has just been created to provide Python bindings for DocuSign's
API. The project is not mature yet, but authors already use it! It means that,
while API and implementation may change (improve!) a bit, authors do care of
the changes.

Also, help is welcome! Feel free to report issues, request features or
refactoring!
