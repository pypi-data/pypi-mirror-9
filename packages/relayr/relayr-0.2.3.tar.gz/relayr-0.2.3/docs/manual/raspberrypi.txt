Raspberry Pi
============

Due to its small size, low price and power consumption and its general
extensibility the Raspberry Pi (or any other similar device) is considered
an interesting platform for projects related to the Internet of Things.

Examples of use to come so stay tuned! 


Updating BlueZ
--------------

The version of BlueZ available for standard distributions for a Raspberry
Pi such as Raspbian, may be old (prior to version 5) and thus incapable of handling
Bluetooth LE well, if at all. It is therefore strongly recommended to install
the most recent version, using a procedure like the one below (compiling BlueZ
on the Raspberry Pi itself takes about 20-30 minutes):

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt-get --purge remove bluez
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev
	wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.24.tar.xz
	tar xf bluez-5.24.tar.xz
	cd bluez-5.24
	./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-library --disable-systemd
	make
	sudo make install
	sudo cp attrib/gatttool /usr/bin
