Documentation 
=============

The official documentation of the relayr Python library is hosted on
ReadTheDocs_. It is also included inside the ``docs/manual`` subdirectory of
the source code distribution. You can render it in various formats using
Sphinx_, a popular tool for creating documentation. If you don't use it
already, please run the following command in the top directory of the source
code tree:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements_doc.txt

This will also install a *theme* named ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` for
reusing the same style locally as the one used on ReadTheDocs_ by default.

Then you could run a little Bash script named ``make_docs.sh`` inside the
same directory to generate the documentation:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./make_docs.sh

By default this renders only the HTML version under ``docs/manual/_build/html``,
but if you uncomment the respective lines inside you can also render versions
in EPUB and PDF format (and perform some link-checking). Please note that for the PDF version you need to
have a working LaTeX installation.
