"""
This module contains tests of the Relayr restful HTTP API client.

The tests are written in plain Python code, without using the unittest frame-
work, so you can run them via py.test (an alternative to unittest! As the
functions are also mostly fully self-contained you can copy/paste/run individual
test method bodies in an interactive Python session! And where the test methods
rely on some fixture parameter the values they provide can be often easily
replaced in copied code.

By convention, test fixtures are Python files with a ``fixture_`` prefix and
provide values used inside the tests like e.g. a user email address or access
token. The fixture loaders are contained in ``conftest.py`` where they will be
discovered by pytest.

Attention: The values in these fixture files need to be set properly before
running the tests!
