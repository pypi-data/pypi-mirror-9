Improving zest.releaser: report bugs, fork on github or email us
================================================================

Did you find a bug? Do you have an improvement? Do you have questions? We run
zest.releaser as a proper open source project on github at
https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser, so you have three basic
options:

- Feel free to report bugs on `our github issue tracker
  <https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser/issues>`_. And feature
  requests, too. Normally you'll get a quick reply within a day or so,
  depending on our relative timezones. If you don't get an answer within a few
  days, please send off a quick email to remind us.

- Hey, we're on github, so fork away to your heart's delight. We got a couple
  of nice fixes and additions in this way.

  *If* you are going to fork zest.releaser, take a look at :doc:`developing`  for
  setup and test running information.


- Email Reinout and Maurits at `reinout@vanrees.org
  <mailto:reinout@vanrees.org>`_ and `maurits@vanrees.org
  <mailto:maurits@vanrees.org>`_. Please email us both at the same time, this
  way at least one of us can give you a quick reply.
