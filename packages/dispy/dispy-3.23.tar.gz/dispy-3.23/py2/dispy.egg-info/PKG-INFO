Description: dispy
        ######
        
        `dispy <http://dispy.sourceforge.net>`_ is a framework for parallel
        execution of computations by distributing them across multiple
        processors in a single machine (SMP), among many machines in a
        cluster, grid or cloud.  dispy is well suited for data parallel (SIMD)
        paradigm where a computation is evaluated with different (large)
        datasets independently with no communication among computation tasks
        (except for computation tasks sending intermediate results to the
        client). If communication/cooperation among tasks is needed, `asyncoro
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/asyncoro>`_ framework could be used.
        
        dispy works with Python versions 2.7+ and 3.1+. It has been tested
        with Linux, OS X and Windows; it may work on other platforms too.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * dispy is implemented with `asyncoro
          <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/asyncoro>`_, an independent framework
          for asynchronous, concurrent, distributed, network programming with
          coroutines (without threads). asyncoro uses non-blocking sockets
          with I/O notification mechanisms epoll, kqueue and poll, and Windows
          I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) for high performance and scalability, so
          dispy works efficiently with a single node or large cluster(s) of
          nodes. asyncoro itself has support for distributed/parallel
          computing, including transferring computations, files etc., and
          message passing (for communicating with client and other computation
          tasks), although it doesn't include job scheduling.
        
        * Computations (Python functions or standalone programs) and their
          dependencies (files, Python functions, classes, modules) are
          distributed automatically.
        
        * Computation nodes can be anywhere on the network (local or
          remote). For security, either simple hash based authentication or
          SSL encryption can be used.
        
        * After each execution is finished, the results of execution, output,
          errors and exception trace are made available for further
          processing.
        
        * Nodes may become available dynamically: dispy will schedule jobs
          whenever a node is available and computations can use that node.
        
        * If callback function is provided, dispy executes that function
          when a job is finished; this can be used for processing job
          results as they become available.
        
        * Client-side and server-side fault recovery are supported:
        
          If user program (client) terminates unexpectedly (e.g., due to
          uncaught exception), the nodes continue to execute scheduled
          jobs. If client-side fault recover option is used when creating a
          cluster, the results of the scheduled (but unfinished at the time of
          crash) jobs for that cluster can be retrieved later.
        
          If a computation is marked reentrant (with 'reentrant=True' option)
          when a cluster is created and a node (server) executing jobs for
          that computation fails, dispy automatically resubmits those jobs to
          other available nodes.
        
        * dispy can be used in a single process to use all the nodes
          exclusively (with ``JobCluster`` - simpler to use) or in multiple
          processes simultaneously sharing the nodes (with
          ``SharedJobCluster`` and *dispyscheduler* program).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        To install dispy for Python 2.7+, run::
        
           pip install dispy
        
        or to install dispy for Python 3.1+, run::
        
           pip3 install dispy
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        dispy is implemented with `asyncoro
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/asyncoro>`_ for concurrent, asynchronous
        network programming. Part of asyncoro package needed for dispy is
        included in dispy package itself. However, other modules in asyncoro
        support asynchronous pipes, distributed programming/computing, so
        users interested in those features may want to install asyncoro as
        well.
        
        Under Windows efficient polling notifier I/O Completion Ports (IOCP)
        is supported only if `pywin32
        <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/>`_ is
        installed; otherwise, inefficient *select* notifier is used.
