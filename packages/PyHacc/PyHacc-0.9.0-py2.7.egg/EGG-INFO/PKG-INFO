Description: Pre-requisites
        --------------
        
        You will need python (2.6 and 2.7 are tested), qtalchemy, sqlalchemy (0.7x 
        preferred), a python database driver, and PyQt4 or PySide.  Refer to setup.py 
        for a more complete list of dependencies.
        
        It should be noted that while PyHacc is a fully functional system which is in
        production use for the author's personal use, it is primarily a demonstration
        and example of qtalchemy_.
        
        .. _qtalchemy: https://bitbucket.org/jbmohler/qtalchemy
        
        As of qtalchemy version 0.8.x, PyHacc uses PySide.  To use PyQt4 instead of
        PySide, you must install from the source in the bitbucket repository.  Install
        in the following way::
        
            python qtbindings.py --platform=PyQt4
            python setup.py build
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        If using PyQt4, the qtalchemy library will also need to be switched to 
        using PyQt4 in a similar way.
        
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        On linux, it should be sufficient to run::
        
            python setup.py build
            sudo python setup.py install
            pyhaccgui --conn=sqlite://
        
        The sqlite:// connection string will start pyhacc with a demo database.
        
        It is recommended and most tested to use pyhacc with postgresql.  To initialize 
        a database::
        
            createdb pyhacc
            pyhacc initdb postgresql://username:password@localhost/pyhacc
            # to run pyhacc connected to this database:
            pyhaccgui --conn=postgresql://username:password@localhost/pyhacc
        
        Getting Started on Windows
        --------------------------
        
        Roughly speaking, the install proceeds as follows:
        
        - Install python and easy_install
        - Install PyQt (or PySide, if desired).
        - easy_install sqlalchemy
        - easy_install pyscopg2  # for postgresql support
        - easy_install pyhacc
        
        On your postgresql server, run the following command::
        
            createdb pyhacc
        
        Initialize the data-set with the following command on the windows client::
        
            c:\python27\python.exe c:\python27\scripts\pyhacc initdb postgresql://username:password@server/pyhacc
        
        Create a windows short-cut with the following target for starting the program::
        
            c:\python27\pythonw.exe c:\python27\scripts\pyhaccgui --conn=postgresql://username:password@server/pyhacc
