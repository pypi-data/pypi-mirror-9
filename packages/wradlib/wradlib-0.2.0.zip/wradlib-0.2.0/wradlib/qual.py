"""
Data Quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will serve two purposes:

#. provide routines to create simple radar data quality related fields.
#. provide routines to decide which radar pixel to choose based on the
   competing information in different quality fields.

Data is supposed to be stored in 'aligned' arrays. Aligned here means that
all fields are structured such that in each field the data for a certain index
is representative for the same physical target.

Therefore no assumptions are made on the dimensions or shape of the input
fields except that they exhibit the numpy ndarray interface.

    """Calculates the height of a radar beam above the antenna according to
    the 4/3 (four-thirds -> ft) effective Earth radius model.
    The formula was taken from [Collier1996]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ranges : array
        the distances of each bin from the radar [m]

    elevations : array
        the elevation angles of each bin from the radar [degrees or radians]

    degrees : bool
        if True (the default) elevation angles are given in degrees and will
        be converted to radians before calculation. If False no transformation
        will be done and elevations has to be given in radians.

    re : float
        earth radius [m]

    Returns
    -------
    output : height of the beam [m]

    Notes
    -----
    The shape of `elevations` and `ranges` may differ in which case numpy's
    broadcasting rules will apply and the shape of `output` will be that of
    the broadcast arrays. See the numpy documentation on how broadcasting works.

    We assume a cone frustum which has the volume V=(pi/3)*h*(R**2 + R*r + r**2).
    R and r are the radii of the two frustum surface circles. Assuming that the
    pulse width is small compared to the range, we get R=r=tan(theta*pi/180)*range.
    Thus, the pulse volume simpy becomes a the volume of a cylinder with
