Description: wradlib - An Open Source Library for Weather Radar Data Processing
        ==================================================================
        
        wradlib is designed to assist you in the most important steps of
        processing weather radar data. These may include: reading common data
        formats, georeferencing, converting reflectivity to rainfall
        intensity, identifying and correcting typical error sources (such as
        clutter or attenuation) and visualising the data.
