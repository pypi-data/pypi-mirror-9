Description: Digital Cinema Server API Library
        =================================
        
        About
        -----
        
        This library attempts to provide a functional and simple python package to manipulate, through their API, different digital cinema servers, players, and theatre management system.
        
        The only brand actually supported is Doremi (company now bought by Dolby).
        
        Current supported machines are :
         - DCP2000
         - DCP-2K4
         - ShowVault
         - IMS1000
        
        Coming next: 
         - Doremi TMS
         - AAM TMS
         - Unique TMS
         - GDC servers
         - Old Dolby servers
         - Sony ?
         - Qube (someday maybe, haha, I can't wait to code with their API again, it is a bloody joke)

        Usage
        -----
        
        ***Lib Usage***
        
        Library is going to be documented in the docs folder.
        But it is not yet for now... so just look at the code as it is commented for that.
        
        ***Script Usage***
        
        Scripts have been created in order to use DCP2000 apis directly from command lines.
        This scripts is named doremi.py and its usage can be found by typing :
        
           bin/doremiapi --help
        
        That should be fairly simple.
        
        For example, to list the CPL on a server :
        
           bin/doremiapi execute 172.17.10.109 GetCPLList
        
        To get information about a CPL :
        
           bin/doremiapi x 172.17.10.109 GetCPLInfo 851cc838-022e-43b7-9fee-18656bdfc995
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        This libraries are used most on Linux and OSX systems, but plenty of functions may work on windows.
        
        This libraries are compatibles with Python 2.X and Python 3.X.
        
        Mainly tested on 2.7 and 3.4.
