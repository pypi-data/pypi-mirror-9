Description: Later: queue functions for execution later in priority and time order.
        ======================================================================
        
        I use Later objects for convenient queuing of functions whose execution occurs later in a priority order with capacity constraints.
        
        Why not futures? I already had this, I prefer its naming scheme and interface, and futures did not seem to support prioritising execution.
        
        Use is simple enough: create a Later instance and typically queue functions with the .defer() method::
        
          L = Later(4)      # a Later with a parallelism of 4
          ...
          LF = L.defer(func, *args, **kwargs)
          ...
          x = LF()          # collect result
        
        The .defer method and its sublings return a LateFunction, which is a subclass of cs.asynchron.Asynchron. As such it is a callable, so to collect the result you just call the LateFunction.
