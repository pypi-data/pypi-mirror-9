Documentation for python-scrapyd-api
====================================

``python-scrapyd-api`` is a very simple Python wrapper for working with
Scrapyd_'s API_; it allows a Python application to talk to, and therefore
control, the Scrapy Daemon.

It is built on top of the Requests_ library and supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3
& 3.4.
