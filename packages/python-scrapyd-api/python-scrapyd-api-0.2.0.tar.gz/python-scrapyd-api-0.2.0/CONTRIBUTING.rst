Submitting Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``python-scrapyd-api`` for local development.

1. Fork the ``python-scrapyd-api`` repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/python-scrapyd-api.git

3. Install your local copy into a ``virtualenv``. Assuming you have ``virtualenvwrapper`` installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv python-scrapyd-api
    $ cd python-scrapyd-api/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Install the requirements needed to develop on ``python-scrapyd-api``. That
   includes doc writing and testing tools::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt


5. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check the following things:

   a. That your changes pass the flake8 linter (use common sense though)::

        $ pip install flake8
        $ flake8 python-scrapyd-api tests

   b. That the tests still run::

        $ python setup.py test

   c. That the tests run for all supported versions of Python. This requires tox and having the various versions of Python installed::

        $ pip install tox
        $ tox

7. Add yourself to the ``AUTHORS.rst`` file as a contributor.

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub. Please use a suitable
   git commit message (summary line, two line breaks, detailed description)::

        $ git add .
        $ git commit
        $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

9. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

How to run the tests
--------------------

To run the tests:

.. code:: bash

    $ python setup.py test
    # or use PyTest directly:
    $ py.test

To see coverage:

.. code:: bash

    # In the terminal:
    $ py.test --cov scrapyd_api tests/
    # As a browseable HTML report:
    $ make coverage


Other development commands
--------------------------

Please run ``make help`` or see the Makefile_ for other development related commands.
