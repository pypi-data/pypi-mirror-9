maiome's library of utilities
=============================

this is a library of semi-useful and hopefully reusable utilities used within a few
of the projects that are in development under the maiome namespace.

 config.configuration -> a "simple" config reader with section promises and special types.
 connection.connection -> a structured-packet based connection client.
 connection.packets -> an extendible packet implementation for use with the other connection classes.
 connection.server -> a structure-packet based connection server.
 database.dbmapper -> a reflective/introspective ORM used for simple object relations in SQLite (and maybe others).
 util.scheduler -> a simple tick-based scheduler suitable for use in ticking event loops.
