Name: colibricore
Version: 0.5.7.4
Summary: Colibri core is an NLP tool as well as a C++ and Python library for working with basic linguistic constructions such as n-grams and skipgrams (i.e patterns with one or more gaps, either of fixed or dynamic size) in a quick and memory-efficient way. At the core is the tool ``colibri-patternmodeller`` which allows you to build, view, manipulate and query pattern models.

        This software is developed in the scope of the Ph.D. research project
        Constructions as Linguistic Bridges. This research examines the identification
        and extraction of aligned constructions or patterns across natural languages,
        and the usage of such constructions in Machine Translation. The aligned
        constructions are not identified on the basis of an extensive and explicitly
        defined grammar or expert database of linguistic knowledge, but rather are
        implicitly distilled from large amounts of example data. Our notion of
        constructions is broad and transcends the idea of words or variable-length
        phrases.
