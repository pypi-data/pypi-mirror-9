pybib |PyPI version|
====================

pybib is a super-easy way to get citations for your LaTeX document.
Instead of typing out BibTeX entries yourself, just give pybib the
Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of the resource you want to cite and it
will get all the information for you. Then, you can just add the
citation it gives you to your BibTeX file. Easy!

Installation
------------

This package is available on PyPi and can be installed with the
following command:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip3 install --user pybib

For user-only installs, pip installs scripts to the directory
``~/.local/bin``, so make sure it's in your path.

Usage examples
--------------

Get a citation:

.. code:: sh

    $ bib 10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230

    @article{Turing_1937,
        doi = {10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230},
        url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230},
        year = 1937,
        month = {jan},
        publisher = {Oxford University Press ({OUP})},
        volume = {s2-42},
        number = {1},
        pages = {230--265},
        author = {A. M. Turing},
        title = {On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem},
        journal = {Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society}
    }

Get a citation and add it to your bibliography file:

.. code:: sh

    $ bib 10.1145/159544.159617 >> citations.bib

Get a citation and add it to your bibliography file, running it through
``bibtool`` first to format the entry and auto-generate a citation key:

.. code:: sh

    $ bib 10.1145/159544.159617 | bibtool >> citations.bib

Convert a file containing a list of DOIs into a bibliography file:

.. code:: sh

    $ bib -f citations.doi
