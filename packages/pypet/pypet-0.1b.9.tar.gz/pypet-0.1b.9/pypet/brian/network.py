"""Module for easy compartmental implementation of a `BRIAN network`_.

Build parts of a network via subclassing :class:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkComponent` and
:class:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkAnalyser` for recording and statistical analysis.

Specify a :class:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkRunner` (subclassing optionally) that handles
the execution of your experiment in different subruns. Subruns can be defined
as :class:`~pypet.brian.parameter.BrianParameter` instances in a particular
trajectory group. You must add to every parameter's :class:`~pypet.annotations.Annotations` the
attribute `order`. This order must be an integer specifying the index or order
the subrun should about to be executed in.

The creation and management of a `BRIAN network`_ is handled by the
:class:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkManager` (no need for subclassing). Pass your
components, analyser and your runner to the manager.

Pass the :func:`~pypet.brian.network.run_network` function together with a
:class:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkManager` to your main environment function
:func:`~pypet.environment.Environment.f_run` to start a simulation and parallel
parameter exploration. Be aware that in case of a *pre-built* network,
successful parameter exploration
requires parallel processing (see :class:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkManager`).

    :param network_runner:  A :class:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkRunner`

        Special component that handles the execution of several subruns.
        A NetworkRunner can be subclassed to implement the
        :func:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkComponent.add_parameters` method to add
        :class:`~pypet.brian.parameter.BrianParameter` instances defining the
        order and duration of subruns.

    :param component_list:

        List of :class:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkComponents` instances to create
        and manage individual parts of a network.
        They are build and added to the network in the order defined in the list.

        :class:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkComponent` always needs to be sublcassed and
        defines only an abstract interface. For instance, one could create her or his
        own subclass called NeuronGroupComponent that creates NeuronGroups_, Whereas
        a SynapseComponent creates Synapses_ between the before built NeuronGroups_.
        Accordingly, the SynapseComponent instance is listed after
        the NeuronGroupComponent.

        .. _NeuronGroups: http://briansimulator.org/docs/reference-models-and-groups.html

        .. _Synapses: http://briansimulator.org/docs/reference-synapses.html

    :param analyser_list:

        List of :class:`~pypet.brian.network.Analyser` instances for recording and
        statistical evaluation of a BRIAN network. They should be used to add monitors
        to a network and to do further processing of the monitor data.

    This division allows to create compartmental network models where one can easily
    replace parts of a network simulation.

    :param force_single_core:

        In case you :func:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkManager.pre_build` or even
        :func:`~pypet.brian.network.NetworkManager.pre_run` a network, you usually cannot
        use single core processing.
        The problem with single core processing is that iterative exploration of the
        parameter space alters the network on every iteration and the network cannot be
        reset to the initial conditions holding before the very first experimental run.
        This is an inherent problem of BRIAN. The only way to overcome this problem is
        multiprocessing and copying (either by pickling or by forking) the whole
        BRIAN environment.

        If you are not bothered by not starting every experimental run with the very same
        network, you can set `force_single_core=True`. The NetworkManager will
        do iterative single processing and ignore the ongoing modification of the network
        throughout all runs.

        In case `multiproc=True` for your environment, the setting of `force_single_core`
        is irrelevant and has no effect.
