# Tessera

Tessera is a front-end interface for Graphite, which provides a large selection of presentations, layout, and interactivity options for building dashboards.

The biggest key differences between Tessera and other frontends are the separation of queries from presentations, and the ability to apply arbitrary transformations to the presentations & queries, allowing for a large degree of interactivity. Tessera is initially focused on information presentation - it does not NOT address the areas of metric discovery or query composition (although it may in the future).

## Overview

Tessera consists of a small python webserver written with Flask with a SQL backing store. The server manages storing and searching for dashboards, managing tags for organization, serving the basic UI assets, and providing a ReST API for the front-end to use.

Dashboards are big lumps of JSON data describing the queries, presentations, and layout, wrapped in a small shell of SQL metadata. Most of the heavy lifting is done by the javascript front-end, which is responsible for all rendering, data fetching from graphite, and editing of dashboards.

## Quick Start

### From Docker

If you're familiar with [docker](http://www.docker.com) and already have a Graphite instance running, you can boot up an instance of tessera with the demo dashboards preloaded and easily point it at your existing Graphite installation using the [`aalpern/tessera-simple`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/aalpern/tessera-simple/) image. If you don't have a Graphite installation handy, a Docker image like [`nickstenning/graphite`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/nickstenning/graphite/) can get that up and running quickly. 

```
docker run -P -e GRAPHITE_URL=http://graphite.host -it aalpern/tessera-simple
```


### From Source

Tessera can be installed easily from
[PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) with `pip` or
`easy_install`. This method of installation is only recommended for
casual use.

```
pip install tessera
```

After installation, create a `config.py` script for your local
settings.

Example `config.py`:

```
GRAPHITE_URL="http://graphite.example.com"
SECRET_KEY="adf71812-9d57-88d3-dfe8-1e9860d2b7ab"
```

Then launch the service:

```
TESSERA_CONFIG=/path/to/config.py tessera
```

The service will be available on
[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) by default, with the demo
dashoards loaded.
