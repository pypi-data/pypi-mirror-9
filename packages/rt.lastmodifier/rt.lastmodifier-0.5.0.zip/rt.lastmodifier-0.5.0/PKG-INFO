Description: Enhance the Plone adding an additional information on document view: the **user who performed the last change** and
        the **change note**.
        Optionally expands the **document byline** section showing those informations.

        Documentation
        =============
        
        Plone already handle lot of infos in the document byline section, like the document author, the modification date
        and the publication date.
        
        In the same way new data added by this add-on will be added to the byline section.

        When the new byline informations are shown?
        -------------------------------------------
        
        New infos apart, all byline elements can now be controlled with a **granular security configuration**.
        This will change the way to handle document byline because commonly Plone simply use a couple of
        site-wide options: the *allow_anon_views_about* and the *displayPublicationDateInByline*.
        
        The viewlet will now handle many different informations: *author*, *last modifier*, *publication date*, *modification date*
        and *last versioning change note* (if versioning is enabled on the content).
        Each information is visible if the user has a specified permission:
        
        - ``rt.lastmodifier: documentByLine view author``
        - ``rt.lastmodifier: documentByLine view last modifier``
        - ``rt.lastmodifier: documentByLine view modification date``
        - ``rt.lastmodifier: documentByLine view publication date``
        - ``rt.lastmodifier: documentByLine view change note``
        
        To show last modifier info, *Creator* and *Modifier* must be not equals (just for not show a duplicate link).
        
        By default Anonymous users can't see anything (this will reproduce the Plone default behavior, where Anonymous
        can't see the byline section by default).
        
        Show change notes
        -----------------
        
        This feature will show the comment to changes you did, that commonly are kept in the history section.
        
        The editor must explicitly choose if a change note must be putted in the byline section by selecting
        the "*Show the changes note in document info*" checkbox.
        This will store *that* change note to be shown in the content, that means that additional changes without
        checking the option will not update that information.

           :alt: New change note section
        
        To *delete* the change note shown you must edit a document, provide an empty note while keeping the check
        selected.
        
        **Note**: this feature require JavaScript to work properly.

        0.2 (2013-04-17)
        ----------------
        
        * Renamed the product from "collective.lastmodifier" to "rt.lastmodifier".
          This is unbelievable and embarassing, but I didn't find `collective.lastmodifier`__ when I looked for
          a Plone product with those features... and in the end I choosed the same name!
          However the original product is using a different approach.
        * Added collection criteria (for new and old ones)
