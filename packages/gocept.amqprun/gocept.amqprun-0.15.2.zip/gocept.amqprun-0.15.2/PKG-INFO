        Basic concepts and terms
        ========================
        
        * A *message handler* is a function which is bound with a routing key to
          exactly one queue. It is called for each message on that queue, and may
          return a list of messages as a result.
        
        * The result messages of one handled message are sent in one transaction
          together with the ACK of the handled message.
        
        * When an exception is raised during message processing, the transaction is
          aborted. (The received message would be NACKed if RabbitMQ was supporting
          it.)
        
        * A message handler handles exactly one message at a time. Multiple messages
          can be processed at the same time using threads. Those threads are called
          *workers*.
        
        
        Things you don't need to take care of
        =====================================
        
        * Threading of multiple workers
        
        * Socket handling and locking for communicating with the AMQP broker
        
        * Transaction handling
        
        * Message ids
        
          * Each outgoing message gets an email-like message id.
        
          * The correlation id of each outgoing message is set to the message id of
            the incoming message.
        
          * Each outgoing message gets a custom references header which is set to the
            incoming message's reference header plus the incoming message's message
            id.
        
        
        Getting started: receiving messages
        ===================================
        
        To get started, define a function which does the work. In this example, we log
        the message body and send a message. The ``declare`` decorator takes two
        arguments, the queue name and the routing key (you can also pass in a list to
        bind the function to multiple routing keys). The ``declare`` decorator also
        supports an optional ``arguments`` argument that is a dictionary to be passed
        to the AMQP queue_declare call to, e.g., support mirrored queues on RabbitMQ.
        The optional argument ``principal`` specifies to wrap the handler call into a
        zope.security interaction using the given principal id (you need the
        ``[security]`` extra to use this integration functionality).
        
        ::
        
            import logging
            import gocept.amqprun.handler
            import gocept.amqprun.message
        
            log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
            @gocept.amqprun.handler.declare('test.queue', 'test.routing')
            def log_message_body(message):
                log.info(message.body)
                msg = gocept.amqprun.message.Message(
                    header=dict(content_type='text/plain'),
                    body=u'Thank you for your message.',
                    routing_key='test.thank.messages')
                return [msg]
        
        
        The handler function needs to be registered as a named utility. With ZCML this
        looks like this [#grok]_::
        
            <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope">
              <include package="gocept.amqprun" />
              <utility component="path.to.package.log_message_body" name="basic" />
            </configure>
        
        To set up a server, it's recommended to create a buildout. The following
        buildout creates a config file for gocept.amqprun as well as a ZCML file for
        the component configuration and uses ZDaemon to daemonize the process::
        
            [buildout]
            parts =
                    config
                    zcml
                    app
                    server
        
            [deployment]
            name = queue
            recipe = gocept.recipe.deploymentsandbox
            root = ${buildout:directory}
        
            [config]
            recipe = lovely.recipe:mkfile
            path = ${deployment:etc-directory}/queue.conf
        
            amqp-hostname = localhost
            amqp-username = guest
            amqp-password = guest
            amqp-virtualhost = /
        
            eventlog =
                <eventlog>
                  level DEBUG
                  <logfile>
                    formatter zope.exceptions.log.Formatter
                    path STDOUT
                  </logfile>
                </eventlog>
            amqp-server =
                <amqp-server>
                  hostname ${:amqp-hostname}
                  username ${:amqp-username}
                  password ${:amqp-password}
                  virtual_host ${:amqp-virtualhost}

            content =

                ${:amqp-server}
                <worker>
                  amount 10
                  component-configuration ${zcml:path}
                </worker>
                <settings>
                  your.custom.settings here
                </settings>
        
            [zcml]
            recipe = lovely.recipe:mkfile
            path = ${deployment:etc-directory}/queue.zcml
            content =
                <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope">
                  <include package="gocept.amqprun" />
                  <include package="your.package" />
                </configure>
        
            [app]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg:script
            eggs =
               gocept.amqprun
               your.package
               zope.exceptions
            arguments = '${config:path}'
            scripts = server=app
        
            [server]
            recipe = zc.zdaemonrecipe
            deployment = deployment
            program = ${buildout:bin-directory}/app
        
        
        .. [#grok] It's likely that there will be a special ZCML statement and/or grok
           support to make registering of handlers easier.
        
        
        Sending messages
        ================
        
        If all you want to do is send messages, you don't have to register any
        handlers, but can use ``gocept.amqprun.server.Server.send()`` directly. While
        the handlers usually run in their own process, started by the ``server``
        entrypoint (as described above), if you're just sending messages, you can also
        skip the extra process and run the ``gocept.amqprun.server.Server`` in your
        original process, in its own thread. Here is some example code to do that::
        
            def start_server(**kw):
                parameters = gocept.amqprun.connection.Parameters(**kw)
                server = gocept.amqprun.server.Server(parameters)
                server_thread = threading.Thread(target=server.start)
                server_thread.daemon = True
                server_thread.start()
                import time
                time.sleep(0.1)
                return server
        
        (When you're using the ZCA, you'll probably want to register the ``Server`` as
        a utility at that point, too, so clients can access it to send messages
        easily.)
        
        
        Settings
        ========
        
        For application-specific settings gocept.amqprun makes the ``<settings>``
        section from the configuration available via an ``ISettings`` utility::
        
            settings = zope.component.getUtility(
                gocept.amqprun.interfaces.ISettings)
            settings.get('your.settings.key')
        
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        * Currently all messages are sent and received through the `amq.topic`
          exchange. Other exchanges are not supported at the moment.
        
        
        Interfacing with the file system
        ================================
        
        Writing
        -------
        
        gocept.amqprun provides a quick way to set up a handler that writes incoming
        messages as individual files to a given directory, using the
        ``<amqp:writefiles>`` ZCML directive. You need the `writefiles` extra to
        enable this directive::
        
            <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
                       xmlns:amqp="http://namespaces.gocept.com/amqp">
        
              <include package="gocept.amqprun" file="meta.zcml" />
        
              <amqp:writefiles
                routing_key="test.data"
                queue_name="test.queue"
                directory="/path/to/output-directory"
                />
            </configure>
        
        All messages with routing key 'test.data' would then be written to
        'output-directory', two files per message, one containing the body and the
        other containing the headers (in ``zope.xmlpickle`` format).
        (Note that in the buildout example above, you would need to put the writefiles
        directive into the ``[zcml]`` section, not the ``[config]`` section.)
        
        You can specify multiple routing keys separated by spaces::
        
            <amqp:writefiles
              routing_key="test.foo test.bar"
              queue_name="test.queue"
              directory="/path/to/output-directory"
              />
        
        You can configure the way files are named with the ``pattern`` parameter, for
        example::
        
            <amqp:writefiles
              routing_key="test.data"
              queue_name="test.queue"
              directory="/path/to/output-directory"
              pattern="${routing_key}/${date}/${msgid}-${unique}.xml"
              />
        
        ``pattern`` performs a ``string.Template`` substitution. The following
        variables are available:
        
          :date: The date the message arrived, formatted ``%Y-%m-%d``
          :msgid: The value of the message-id header
          :xfilename: The value of the X-Filename header
          :routing_key: The routing key of the message
          :unique: A token that guarantees the filename will be unique in its directory
        
        The default value for ``pattern`` is ``${routing_key}-${unique}``.
        
        To support zc.buildout, ``{variable}`` is accepted as an alternative syntax to
        ``${variable}``. (zc.buildout uses ``${}`` for its own substitutions, but
        unfortunately does not support escaping them.)
        
        If ``pattern`` contains slashes, intermediate directories will be created below
        ``directory``, so in the example, messages would be stored like this::
        
            /path/to/output-directory/example.route/2011-04-07/asdf998-1234098791.xml
        
        Just like the ``declare`` decorator, the ``<amqp:writefiles>`` ZCML directive
        also supports an optional ``arguments`` parameter that is passed to the AMQP
        ``queue_declare`` call to, e.g., support RabbitMQ mirrored queues::
        
            <amqp:writefiles
              routing_key="test.foo test.bar"
              queue_name="test.queue"
              directory="/path/to/output-directory"
              arguments="
              x-ha-policy = all
              "
              />
        
        Reading
        -------
        
        You can also set up a thread to read files from a directory and publish them
        onto the queue, using the ``<amqp:readfiles>`` ZCML directive (the filename
        will be transmitted in the ``X-Filename`` header). You need the `readfiles`
        extra to enable this directive::
        
            <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
                       xmlns:amqp="http://namespaces.gocept.com/amqp">
        
              <include package="gocept.amqprun" file="meta.zcml" />
        
              <amqp:readfiles
                directory="/path/to/input-directory"
                routing_key="test.data"
                />
            </configure>
        
        The input-directory is expected to be a Maildir, i.e. files to be read should
        appear in ``input-directory/new` which will be polled every second. After the
        files have been published to the given routing key, they will be moved to
        ``input-directory/cur``.
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        You can set the AMQP server parameters for running the tests via environment
        variables:
        
        :AMQP_HOSTNAME:
            default: localhost
        
        :AMQP_USERNAME:
            default: guest
        
        :AMQP_PASSWORD:
            default: guest
        
        :AMQP_VIRTUALHOST:
            default: None, so a vhost with a temporary name is created and
            deleted automatically (using ``AMQP_RABBITMQCTL`` command)
        
        :AMQP_RABBITMQCTL:
           default: 'sudo rabbitmqctl'

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        0.15.2 (2015-02-24)
        -------------------
        
        - Fix error reporting in ``.testing.QueueLayer.rabbitmqctl()``.
        
        
        0.15.1 (2015-01-21)
        -------------------
        
        - Moved code to and bug tracker to Bitbucket_.
        
        .. _Bitbucket : https://bitbucket.org/gocept/gocept.amqprun
        
        
        0.15.0 (2014-10-08)
        -------------------
        
        - Pretend to support savepoints so we can work together with other systems that
          support (and require) them.
        
        
        0.14.0 (2014-09-09)
        -------------------
        
        - Introduce ``gocept.amqprun.handler.ErrorHandlingHandler`` base class.
        
        - Run integration tests (MainTestCase) in a separate ZCA, isolated from any
          registrations that might have been done by other tests.
        
        - Create temporary virtualhost on the rabbitmq server per test run.
        
        - Improved test-case method ``send_message`` to take headers as a parameter.
        
        
        0.13.0 (2014-04-16)
        -------------------
        
        - Introduce ``IResponse`` for transaction-integrated exception handling.
        
        - Fix timing bug: when the remote side closes the socket and at the same time a
          channel switch is triggered, this used to break down (since the socket is
          closed). We now ignore the channel switch attempt and simply wait for the
          reconnect, which opens a new channel anyway.
        
        
        0.12.2 (2014-02-20)
        -------------------
        
        - Add ``xfilename`` variable to the ``<amqp:writefiles pattern="">`` setting.
        
        
        0.12.1 (2014-02-20)
        -------------------
        
        - Add safeguard that two handlers cannot bind to the same queue.
        
        
        0.12 (2014-02-13)
        -----------------
        
        - Include <amqp:writefiles> into the transaction handling, i.e. write to file
          only on commit. Previously, when an error occurred e.g. inside the
          MessageStored event, duplicate files would be written (each time the message
          was processed again on retry after the error).
        
        
        0.11 (2014-01-21)
        -----------------
        
        - Crash the process on filesystem errors for <amqp:readfiles>. Previously only
          the file reading thread crashed, but the process kept running, unaware that
          it now was not doing its job anymore, since the thread had died.
        
        
        0.10 (2013-05-28)
        -----------------
        
        - Support more than one Server in a single process.
        
        - Introduce ``setup_handlers`` parameter for Server so clients can disable
          setting up handlers.
        
        - Fix a bug in the <amqp:readfiles> transaction implementation that caused
          crash when aborting a transaction (#12437).
        
        - Allow test server to take longer time for startup on slow computers.

        0.9.4 (2012-09-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix IDataManager implementation: abort() may be called multiple times,
          regardless of transaction outcome. Only release the channel refcount once.
        
        
        0.9.3 (2012-09-07)
        ------------------

        0.9.1 (2012-09-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix IDataManager implementation: tpc_abort() may also be called without a
          prior tpc_begin() (happens for errors in savepoints, for example).
        - Fix method signature of Connection.close().
        
        
        0.9 (2012-08-31)
        ----------------
        
        - Introduce optional integration with zope.security: handlers can declare a
          principal id with which an interaction will be created.
        - Use a separate channel for sending messages that are not a response to a
          received message.
        - Introduce SETTINGS_LAYER for tests relying on ISettings.

        - Fix race condition that caused messages to be acknowledged on a different
          channel than they were received on (#10635).
        
        - Fix race condition that caused attempts at sending messages before the
          server was started properly (#10620).

          (#10478).
        
        
        0.6 (2012-02-22)
        ----------------
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        - Changed FileStoreReader from its own process to a thread that uses
          gocep.amqprun for sending (previously it used amqplib). Introduced

        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix to support unicode arguments for queue declaration as pika
          only supports bytestrings here.
        - Bugfix to make ``arguments`` parameter of ``amqp:writefiles`` work (#10115).

        - Renamed ``gocept.amqprun.server.MessageReader`` into
          ``gocept.amqprun.server.Server`` and added a ``send`` method so it can
          initiate sending of messages.
        
        - Add support for arguments for queue_declare e.g to support x-ha-policy
          headers for RabbitMQ mirrored queue deployments (#10036).
        
        
        Internal
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        - Internal API change in ``server.AMQPDataManager.__init__``: the `message`
          parameter is now optional, so it was moved to the end of the list of
          arguments.
        
        - Use plone.testing for layer infrastructure.

        - The correlation id of outgoing messages is set to the incoming message's
          message id (if set).
        - A custom header ``references`` is set to the incoming message's reference
          header + the incomming message's message id (like `References` in RFC5322).
        - Fixed broken tests.
        - Allow upper case in settings keys.
        - Extend AMQP server configuration for FileStoreReader to include credentials
