#: Name of the package for release purposes.  This is the name which labels
#: the tarballs and RPMs made by distutils, so it's best to lowercase it.
name = 'sardana'

#: For versions with substrings (like 0.6.16.svn), use an extra . to separate
#: the new substring. We have to avoid using either dashes or underscores,
#: because bdist_rpm does not accept dashes (an RPM) convention, and
#: bdist_deb does not accept underscores (a Debian convention).

 accessed via an IPython console and a generic graphical user interface
 (both of which are easily extensible by the user).'''
