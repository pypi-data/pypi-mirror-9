Description: pytest-gitignore
        ================
        
        This py.test plugin will tell py.test to ignore any file that git
        ignores, when it's collecting tests.  For example, if you keep virtualenvs
        in your source directory, you can have both git and py.test ignore them
        by putting them in your .gitignore.  To see whether a file is ignored
        by git, run `git check-ignore (filename)`.
        
        This plugin is registered as 'gitignore'.
