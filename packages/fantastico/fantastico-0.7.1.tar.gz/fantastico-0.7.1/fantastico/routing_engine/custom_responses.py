from fantastico.exceptions import FantasticoError
from webob.response import Response

class RedirectResponse(Response):
    '''This class encapsulates the logic for programatically redirecting client from a fantastico controller.

    .. code-block:: python

        @Controller(url="/redirect/example")
        def redirect_to_google(self, request):
            return request.redirect("http://www.google.ro/")

    There are some special cases when you would like to pass some query parameters to redirect destination. This is also easily
    achievable in Fantastico:

    .. code-block:: python

        @Controller(url="/redirect/example")
        def redirect_to_google(self, request):
            return request.redirect("http://www.google.ro/search",
                                    query_params=[("q", "hello world")])

    The above example will redirect client browser to
    `http://www.google.ro/search?q=hello world <http://www.google.ro/search?q=hello world>`_'''

    def __init__(self, destination, query_params=None, redirect_status=302):
        if destination is None or len(destination.strip()) == 0:
            raise FantasticoError("You can not build a redirect response without a valid destination.")

        self._destination = destination
        self._query_params = query_params or []

        self._build_destination()

        super(RedirectResponse, self).__init__(status=redirect_status,
                                               headerlist=[("Location", self._destination),
                                                           ("Content-Type", "text/html")],
                                               content_type="text/html")

    def _build_destination(self):
        '''This method is used to append the given query params to the base destination.'''

        params = ["%s=%s" % (param[0], param[1]) for param in self._query_params]

        if not params:
            return

        self._destination = "%s?%s" % (self._destination, "&".join(params))
