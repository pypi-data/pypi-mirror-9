class Resource(object):
    '''
    .. image:: /images/roa/roa_classes.png

    This class provides the main way for defining resources. Below you can find a very simple example for defining new resources:

    .. code-block:: python

        @Resource(name="app-setting", url="/app-settings")
        class AppSetting(BASEMODEL):
            id = Column("id", Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
            name = Column("name", String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)
            value = Column("value", Text, nullable=False)

            def __init__(self, name=None, value=None):
               self.name = name
               self.value = value

    Starting from **Fantastico** version 0.6 ROA resources support OAuth2 authorization. Because of this, resources can now be
    user dependent or user independent. In order for authorization to work as expected for resources which are available only
    to certain users you can use the following code snippet:

    .. code-block:: python

        @Resource(name="app-setting", url="/app-settings", user_dependent=True)
        class AppSetting(BASEMODEL):
            id = Column("id", Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
            name = Column("name", String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)
            value = Column("value", Text, nullable=False)
            user_id = Column("user_id", Integer, nullable=False)

            def __init__(self, name=None, value=None, user_id=None):
               self.name = name
               self.value = value
               self.user_id = user_id

    If you do not define a user_id property for user dependent resources a runtime exception is raised. In order to find out more
    about OAuth2 authorization implemented into fantastico please read: :doc:`/features/oauth2`.
