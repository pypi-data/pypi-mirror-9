10020 - No body given
=====================

Whenever we try to create / update a resource without sending resource body (information about the resource) this response is
received. Below you can see a sample error response:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"error_code": 10020,
    "error_description": "Friendly error description.",
    "error_details": <link to this page>}
