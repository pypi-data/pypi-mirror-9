Step 5 - TODO final notes
=========================

During the last 30 minutes you have created a **TODO** web application using **Fantastico** framework. You have already noticed
how easily it is to create resources and REST apis in a declarative manner without actually writing any line of code for
pagination, filtering and sorting.

Moreover, you have seen how you can keep clean markup in your projects by using **Fantastico** components. In the end you added
Google Analytics for tracking the performance of your **TODO** web application.

What's next?
------------

It is recommended to first take the challenges below before implementing your real life **Fantastico** project:

   #. Send a uniquely generated cookie for uniquely identify the user session.
   #. Make tasks belong to a unique user (identified by the cookie from previous step).
   #. Add a category resource and try to make tasks belong to one or more categories. Be aware, that GET collection and GET item
      from collection ROA APIs works perfectly with relationships.
   #. Separate ROA APIs domain from application domain. (e.g `<http://api.todo.com>`_).
   #. You are ready to rock.

tutorial. You can see the application from this tutorial together with user session improvements
and separation of api from application domain deployed on: `<http://todo.fantastico.scrum-expert.ro/frontend/ui/index>`_.
