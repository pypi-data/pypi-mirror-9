===================

Fantastico framework is really young and continuously improving. As of version **0.2.0** it is extremely easy to reuse components
provided urls in other context. This feature opens the possibility to provide common day by day used components in
new projects in order to accelerate development. In this document you can find a detailed list of built in components
as well as sample of how to use them:
