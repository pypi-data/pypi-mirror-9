12030 - OAuth token expired
===========================

This is a frequent error you might encounter when using OAuth tokens for accessing APIs. You can easily recover from this
by obtaining a new access token and retry the API call with the new token.

A better solution is to cache the token TTL and with 1 minute before expiration try to renew the token transparently. Like this
you guarantee no service interruption will occur for your end users.
