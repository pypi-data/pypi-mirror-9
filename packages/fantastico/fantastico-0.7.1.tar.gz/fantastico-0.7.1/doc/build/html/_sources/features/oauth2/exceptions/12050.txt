12050 - OAuth invalid client error
==================================

This error response usually occurs during authorization phase, when an inexistent client_id is specified. In order to fix it,
you must register the client_id before trying to issue new tokens for it.

A second scenario, which is highly improbable is that some deleted the client_id from registered clients after you have obtained
a valid authorized token.
