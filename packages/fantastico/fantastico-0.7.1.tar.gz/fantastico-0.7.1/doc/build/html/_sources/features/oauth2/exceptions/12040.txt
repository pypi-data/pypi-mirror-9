12040 - OAuth token encryption error
====================================

In most cases you will not end up with this OAuth error returned for your API call. This happens in one of the two scenarios:

   #. Someone tries to send a fake token which can not be interpreted by Fantastico.
   #. Client keys have been wrongly rotated. In this case simply report a bug to project creator.
