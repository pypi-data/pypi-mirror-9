10000 - Resource Collection Not Found
=====================================

Whenever we try a ROA dynamic REST operation (Read / Create / Update / Delete) on a resource and version which are not registered
this error is returned. It is always a **json** compatible response:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"error_code": 10000,
    "error_description": "Friendly error description.",
    "error_details": <link to this page>}
