Description: Django Development Fabfile
        ==========================
        
        A fabfile to ease many tasks during development and deployment of Django
        projects.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Just add ``django-development-fabfile`` to your ``requirements.txt`` and
        install it via ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
        
        Then create the following files in your project root (usually the folder where
        your ``manage.py`` file resides)::
        
            fabfile/
            -- __init__.py
            -- your_own_fab_tasks.py
        
        In your ``fabfile/__init__.py`` put the following code::
        
            # flake8: noqa
            from myproject import settings
            from django.core.management import setup_environ
            setup_environ(settings)
        
            from development_fabfile.fabfile import *
            from .your_own_fab_tasks import *
        
        In your ``settings.py`` at the very bottom add the following::
        
            from fabfile_settings import *  # NOQA
        
        Then create a ``fabfile_settings.py`` next to your ``settings.py`` and add
        all necessary settings. As a starting point you can copy the
        ``fabfile_settings.py.sample`` of this project and change all values to your
        project.
