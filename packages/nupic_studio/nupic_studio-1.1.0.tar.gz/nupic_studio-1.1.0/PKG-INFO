Description: NuPIC Studio is a virtual studio that allows developers to create, debug, and visualize HTM networks from NuPIC library. Some of its advantages:
        * Users can open, save, or change their "HTM projects" or of other developers. A typical project contains data to be trained, neural network configuration, statistics, etc, which can be shared to be analysed or integrated with other projects.
        * Users can create their own encoders and sensors to feed the HTM network.
        * Any changes in the nupic source can be immediatedly viewed. This helps users that wish test improvements like hierarchy, attention, and motor integration.
