        ======
        
        Validation of Exoplanet Signals using a Probabilistic Algorithm--- calculating false positive probabilities for transit signals
        
        For usage and more info, `check out the documentation <http://vespa.rtfd.org>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install, you can get the most recently released version from PyPI::
        
            pip install vespa [--user]
        
        Or you can clone the repository::
        
            git clone https://github.com/timothydmorton/vespa.git
            cd vespa
            python setup.py install [--user]
        
        The ``--user`` argument may be necessary if you don't have root privileges.
        
        Depends on typical scientific packages (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`),
        as well as `isochrones <http://github.com/timothydmorton/isochrones>`_, and (in several corners of the code), another package of mine called `simpledist <http://github.com/timothydmorton/simpledist>`_.  All dependencies *should* get resolved upon install, though this has only been tested under the anaconda Python distribution, which has all the scientific stuff already well-organized.
