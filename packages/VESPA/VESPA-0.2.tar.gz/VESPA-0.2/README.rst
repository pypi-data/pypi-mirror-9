VESPA
======

Validation of Exoplanet Signals using a Probabilistic Algorithm--- calculating false positive probabilities for transit signals

For usage and more info, `check out the documentation <http://vespa.rtfd.org>`_.

Installation
------------

To install, you can get the most recently released version from PyPI::

    pip install vespa [--user]

Or you can clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/timothydmorton/vespa.git
    cd vespa
    python setup.py install [--user]

The ``--user`` argument may be necessary if you don't have root privileges.

Depends on typical scientific packages (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`),
as well as `isochrones <http://github.com/timothydmorton/isochrones>`_, and (in several corners of the code), another package of mine called `simpledist <http://github.com/timothydmorton/simpledist>`_.  All dependencies *should* get resolved upon install, though this has only been tested under the anaconda Python distribution, which has all the scientific stuff already well-organized.
