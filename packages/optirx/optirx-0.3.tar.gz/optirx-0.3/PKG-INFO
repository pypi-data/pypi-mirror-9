Description: OptiRX
        ======
        
        A pure Python library to receive motion capture data from OptiTrack
        Streaming Engine.
        
        OptiTrack is a line of motion capture products by NaturalPoint. Their
        software can broadcast motion capture data via a documented binary
        protocol. It is supposed to be used together with the proprietary
        NatNet SDK, which, unfortunately, is not available for Python, nor
        cannot be used with free toolchains (GCC, Clang). OptiRX is based on
        the direct depacketization example from the SDK and does not use
        NatNet SDK.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        ::
        
            pip install optirx
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Tracking Tools 2.5.0; Motive 1.5.x (NatNet 2.5.0.0), 1.7.x (NatNet 2.7.0.0).
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Assuming that Tracking Tools or Motion runs on the same machine and
        broadcasting is enabled with the default parameters, this code
        receives and prints all data frames::
        
            import optirx as rx
        
            dsock = rx.mkdatasock()
            version = (2, 7, 0, 0)  # NatNet version to use
            while True:
                data = dsock.recv(rx.MAX_PACKETSIZE)
                packet = rx.unpack(data, version=version)
                if type(packet) is rx.SenderData:
                    version = packet.natnet_version
                print packet
        
        
        Alternatives
        ------------
        
        - use VRPN streaming protocol.
        - use Matlab or Microsoft toolchains.
        - use PyNatNet and NatNet SDK
