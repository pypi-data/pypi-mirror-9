        Overview
        --------
        
        Google provides server side adds via its DFP service. This product is inspired
        by the code at
        http://support.google.com/dfp_sb/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1651549. To keep
        the Django implementation as simple as possible this product changes the order
        of the Javascript from that page.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        #. Install or add ``django-dfp`` to your Python path.
        
        #. Add ``dfp`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Load `dfp_tags` in your template with `{% load dfp_tags %}`. Call `{ %dfp_footer %}`
        once near the end of your document body. You would typically call it just
        before the closing body tag.
        
        An example tag is
        
            {% dfp_tag "/1234/travel" 300 250 interests="sports,music" position="top" color=variable foo=bar %}
        
        String values are comma delimited. Note the lack of spaces around the comma.
        Both keys and values can be variables.
        
        You may call as many tags as you want. See http://support.google.com/dfp_sb/bin/answier.py?hl=en&answer=1651549 for more examples.
