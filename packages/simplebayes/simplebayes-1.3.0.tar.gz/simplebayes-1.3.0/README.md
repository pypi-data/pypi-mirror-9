This work is heavily inspired by the python "redisbayes" module found here:
[https://github.com/jart/redisbayes] and [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redisbayes]

I've elected to write this to alleviate the network/time requirements when
using the bayesian classifier to classify large sets of text, or when
attempting to train with very large sets of sample data.
```

Installation
------------
```bash
sudo pip install simplebayes
```

Basic Usage
-----------
```python
import simplebayes
bayes = simplebayes.SimpleBayes()

bayes.train('good', 'sunshine drugs love sex lobster sloth')
bayes.train('bad', 'fear death horror government zombie')

assert bayes.classify('sloths are so cute i love them') == 'good'
assert bayes.classify('i would fear a zombie and love the government') == 'bad'

print bayes.score('i fear zombies and love the government')
```

Cache Usage
-----------
```python
import simplebayes
bayes = simplebayes.SimpleBayes(cache_path='/my/cache/')
# Cache file is '/my/cache/_simplebayes.pickle'
# Default cache_path is '/tmp/'

if not bayes.cache_train():
    # Unable to load cache data, so we're training it
    bayes.train('good', 'sunshine drugs love sex lobster sloth')
    bayes.train('bad', 'fear death horror government zombie')

    # Saving the cache so next time the training won't be needed
    bayes.persist_cache()
```

Tokenizer Override
------------------
```python
import simplebayes

def my_tokenizer(sample):
    return sample.split()

bayes = simplebayes.SimpleBayes(tokenizer=my_tokenizer)
```
