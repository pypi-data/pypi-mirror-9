Description: simplebayes
        ===========
        A memory-based, optional-persistence naïve bayesian text classifier.
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        ::
        
            This work is heavily inspired by the python "redisbayes" module found here:
            [https://github.com/jart/redisbayes] and [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redisbayes]
        
            I've elected to write this to alleviate the network/time requirements when
            using the bayesian classifier to classify large sets of text, or when
            attempting to train with very large sets of sample data.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        ::
        
            sudo pip install simplebayes
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        ::
        
            import simplebayes
            bayes = simplebayes.SimpleBayes()
        
            bayes.train('good', 'sunshine drugs love sex lobster sloth')
            bayes.train('bad', 'fear death horror government zombie')
        
            assert bayes.classify('sloths are so cute i love them') == 'good'
            assert bayes.classify('i would fear a zombie and love the government') == 'bad'
        
            print bayes.score('i fear zombies and love the government')
        
        Cache Usage
        -----------
        ::
        
            import simplebayes
            bayes = simplebayes.SimpleBayes(cache_path='/my/cache/')
            # Cache file is '/my/cache/_simplebayes.pickle'
            # Default cache_path is '/tmp/'
        
            if not bayes.cache_train():
                # Unable to load cache data, so we're training it
                bayes.train('good', 'sunshine drugs love sex lobster sloth')
                bayes.train('bad', 'fear death horror government zombie')
        
                # Saving the cache so next time the training won't be needed
                bayes.persist_cache()
        
        Tokenizer Override
        ------------------
        ::
        
            import simplebayes
        
            def my_tokenizer(sample):
                return sample.split()
        
            bayes = simplebayes.SimpleBayes(tokenizer=my_tokenizer)
