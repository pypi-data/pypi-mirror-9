simplebayes
===========
A memory-based na√Øve bayesian text classifier.
----------------------------------------------
```
This work is heavily inspired by the python "redisbayes" module found here:
[https://github.com/jart/redisbayes] and [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redisbayes]

I've elected to write this to alleviate the network/time requirements when
using the bayesian classifier to classify large sets of text, or when
attempting to train with very large sets of sample data.
```

Installation
------------
```
PIP:
sudo pip install simplebayes
```
```
GIT:
sudo pip install git+git://github.com/hickeroar/simplebayes.git
```

Basic Usage
-----------
```
import simplebayes
bayes = simplebayes.SimpleBayes()

bayes.train('good', 'sunshine drugs love sex lobster sloth')
bayes.train('bad', 'fear death horror government zombie')

assert bayes.classify('sloths are so cute i love them') == 'good'
assert bayes.classify('i would fear a zombie and love the government') == 'bad'

print bayes.score('i fear god and love the government')
```
