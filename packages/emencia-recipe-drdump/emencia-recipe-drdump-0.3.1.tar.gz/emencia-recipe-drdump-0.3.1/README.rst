`Buildout`_ recipe for `Dr Dump`_ to generate bash script to dump or load `Django`_ data dump.

So this recipe will create two bash scripts, one to dump datas from defined eggs in buildout config and another to load these dumped datas.

This will use the defined eggs list in your buildout config to find the apps to manage dumps so be careful that it can't retrieve apps that are not defined in your eggs to install, it will not follow eggs dependancies but if needed you can *force* some apps using the ``extra_apps`` option.

recipe
    Required, fill it with ``emencia-recipe-drdump``.
eggs
    Optional, 'eggs' variable from buildout. Default use ``${buildout:eggs}``.
dump_dir
    Optional, a path to the directory that will contains dumped datas, this is always a relative path from the buildout project. If not defined the dumps dir will be ``dumps``.
dependancies_map
    Required, a path to a JSON file containing datas dependancies map between apps. This can be either a file name existing in Dr Dump or a path (relative or absolute) to an external JSON file.
extra_apps
    Optional, a string of app names formatted like the egg names in ``${buildout:eggs}``. This will be used to defined additional apps that can't be retrieved from the installed eggs.
django_instance
    Required, a path to the django script, usually the one generated by *djangorecipe*.
silent
    Optional, false or true to define respectively if Dr Dump raise or not an exception when asked dumps does not exists in the used map.
dump_other_apps
    Optional, false or true to define if Dr Dump will dump not specify apps in a last dump.
exclude_apps
    Optional, a string of app names formatted like the egg names in ``${buildout:eggs}``. This will be used to defined additional apps that can't be dump if ``dump_other_apps`` is True.
bin_directory
    Optional, binary directory path where the scripts will be written, defaut use ``${buildout:bin-directory}``.

Here is a sample to use this recipe : ::

    [drdump]
    recipe                  = emencia-recipe-drdump
    dump_dir                = dumps
    dependancies_map        = djangocms-3.json
    silent                  = true
    dump_other_apps         = true
    exclude_apps            = auth sessions contenttypes menus.cachekey filebrowser
    django_instance         = ${buildout:directory}/bin/django-instance
    extra_apps              = cmsplugin-various
    bin_directory           = ${buildout:bin-directory}
