Install
-------

``dask`` is not yet on any package index.  It is still experimental.

::

    python setup.py install

Example
-------

Consider the following simple program

.. code-block:: python

   def inc(i):
       return i + 1

   def add(a, b):
       return a + b

   x = 1
   y = inc(x)
   z = add(y, 10)

We encode this as a dictionary in the following way

.. code-block:: python

   d = {'x': 1,
        'y': (inc, 'x'),
        'z': (add, 'y', 10)}

While less aesthetically pleasing this dictionary may now be analyzed,
optimized, and computed on by other Python code, not just the Python
interpreter.

Dependencies
------------

``dask.core`` supports Python 2.6+ and Python 3.2+ with a common codebase.  It
is pure Python and requires no dependencies beyond the standard library.

It is, in short, a light weight dependency.

The threaded implementation depends on networkx.  The ``Array`` dataset depends
on ``numpy`` and the ``blaze`` family of projects.


Related Work
------------

One might ask why we didn't use one of these other fine libraries:

* Luigi_
* Joblib_
* mrjob_
* Any of the fine schedulers in numeric analysis (DAGue_, ...)
* Any of the fine high-throughput schedulers (Condor_, Pegasus_, Swiftlang_, ...)

The answer is because we wanted all of the following:

* Fine-ish grained parallelism (latencies around 1ms)
* In-memory communication of intermediate results
* Dependency structures more complex than ``map``
* Good support for numeric data
* First class Python support
* Trivial installation

Most task schedulers in the Python ecosystem target long-running batch jobs,
often for processing large amounts of text and aren't appropriate for executing
multi-core numerics.
