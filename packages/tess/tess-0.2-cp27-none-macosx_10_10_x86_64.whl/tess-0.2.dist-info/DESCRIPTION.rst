Description
-----------

Tess is a library to calculate Voronoi (and Laguerre) tessellations in 3D and analyze their
structure. The tessellation is calculated as a `list` of `Cell` objects, each of which
can give information on its volume, centroid, number of faces, surface area, etc. The library is 
made with packings of spherical particles in mind, possibly with variable sizes.
