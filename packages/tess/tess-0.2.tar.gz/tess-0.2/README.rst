Description
-----------

Tess is a library to calculate Voronoi (and Laguerre) tessellations in 3D and analyze their
structure. The tessellation is calculated as a list of :class:`~tess.Cell` objects, each of which
can give information on its volume, centroid, number of faces, surface area, etc. The library is 
made with packings of spherical particles in mind, possibly with variable sizes. 

voro++
~~~~~~

The Tess library is a set of Python bindings to the Voro++ library. Voro++ provides all the 
algorithms, and Tess provides an easy to use interface to the voro++ library for Python, using
Cython to do so.

Quick Start
-----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install, use ``pip`` (or ``easy_install``)::

    pip install --user tess

Or to install from Github_::
    
    pip install --user git+git://github.com/wackywendell/tess@master
    
.. _github: https://www.github.com/wackywendell/tess

Usage
~~~~~

The first step is to create a :class:`~tess.Container`::

    >>> cntr = Container([[1,1,1], [2,2,2]], limits=(3,3,3), periodic=False)

A container is a list of :class:`~tess.Cell` objects, representing Voronoi ells:
    
    >>> [round(v.volume(), 3) for v in cntr]
    [13.5, 13.5]

:class:`~tess.Cell` objects have many methods. Here are a few::

    >>> [v.pos for v in cntr]
    [(1.0, 1.0, 1.0), (2.0, 2.0, 2.0)]
    
    >>> [v.centroid() for v in cntr]
    [(1.09375, 1.09375, 1.09375), (1.90625, 1.90625, 1.90625)]
    
    >>> [v.neighbors() for v in cntr]
    [[-5, -2, -3, -1, -4, 1, -6], [0, -3, -6, -4, -5, -2, -1]]
    
    >>> [v.face_areas() for v in cntr]
    [[7.875, 1.125, 7.875, 7.875, 1.125, 11.691342951089922, 1.125],
     [11.691342951089922, 1.125, 7.875, 7.875, 1.125, 7.875, 1.125]]
    
    >>> [v.normals() for v in cntr]
    [[(0.0, 0.0, -1.0),
      (1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
      (0.0, -1.0, 0.0),
      (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
      (0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
      (0.5773502691896257, 0.5773502691896257, 0.5773502691896257),
      (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)],
     [(-0.5773502691896257, -0.5773502691896257, -0.5773502691896257),
      (-0.0, -1.0, -0.0),
      (0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
      (0.0, 1.0, -0.0),
      (0.0, 0.0, -1.0),
      (1.0, 0.0, -0.0),
      (-1.0, -0.0, -0.0)]]

them on your own!
