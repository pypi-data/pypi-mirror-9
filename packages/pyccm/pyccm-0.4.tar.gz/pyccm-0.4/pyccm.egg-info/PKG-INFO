        =====
        
        This package computes the Convergent Cross Mapping described by
        Sugihara et al., 2012: "Detecting Causality in Complex Ecosystems". Science 338: 496–500
        
        This code was adapted from https://github.com/cjbayesian/rccm by Corey Chivers.

        Version History
        ---------------
        
        0.4: The correlations are computed on the vector at lag 0. Note: this returns to the Sugihara et al. approach.
             Bug fixes with E>2
        
        0.3: The correlations are computed on the lagged vectors. Note: this departs from Sugihara et al.
        
        0.2: Added the capability of analyzing time series limited to a few months per year
        
        0.1: First version
