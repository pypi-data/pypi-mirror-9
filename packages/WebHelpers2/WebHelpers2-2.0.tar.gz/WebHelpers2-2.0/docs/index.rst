**WebHelpers2** is the successor to the widely-used WebHelpers_ utility
functions.  It narrows the focus to a core set of utilities that are most
widely used, feasable to port to Python 3,  and relevant to Pyramid and
other current frameworks.  It renovates the popular HTML builder, and
keeps most of the HTML tag helpers and text-processing, number formatting,
statistics, and date functions.

**Version 2.0** is the final release, and is suitable for production. There
are no changes since RC 3.
