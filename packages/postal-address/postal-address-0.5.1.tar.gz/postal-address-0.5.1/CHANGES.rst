------------------

* Fix bad released version.


0.5.0 (2015-03-30)
------------------

* Increase capabilities of alias resolution by ``country_aliases()`` method,
  which in turns increase address normalization efficiency.
* Remove backward compatibility with ``0.3`` series.
* Remove deprecated ``territory.territory_tree()`` method which provided
  backward compatibilityi with the ``0.1`` series. It should have been removed
  in the ``0.3.0`` release.
* Split-up ``supported_territory_codes()`` into ``supported_country_codes()``
  and ``supported_subdivision_codes()``.

------------------

* Fix rendering of subdivision-less addresses.


0.4.2 (2015-03-26)

  set.


0.4.1 (2015-03-26)
------------------

* Base our custom ``InvalidAddress`` exception on ``ValueError`` to increase
  backward compatibility.


0.4.0 (2015-03-25)
------------------

* Show subdivision as-is in rendered address if not already printed by state,
  country or city.
* Document stability policy. Closes #8.

0.3.2 (2015-03-25)
