Signals
*******

Flatland can notify your code when events of interest occur during
flatland processing using "Blinker" signals.  These signals can be
used for advanced customization in your application or simply as a
means for tracing and logging flatland activity during development.

element_set = <blinker.base.NamedSignal object at 0x1057b9950; 'element_set'>

   Emitted after "set()" has been called on an element.

   Parameters:
      * **sender** -- the element

      * **adapted** -- boolean, True if the set() adapted
        successfully.

validator_validated = <blinker.base.NamedSignal object at 0x1057b9990; 'validator_validated'>

   Emitted after a validator has processed an element.

   Parameters:
      * **sender** -- the validator callable doing validation

      * **element** -- the element being validated

      * **state** -- the *state* passed to "validate()"
