Arrays and MultiValues
**********************


"Array"
=======

class class Array(value=Unspecified, **kw)

   Bases: "flatland.schema.containers.Sequence"

   A transparent homogeneous Container, for multivalued form elements.

   Arrays hold a collection of values under a single name, allowing
   all values of a repeated "(key, value)" pair to be captured and
   used.  Elements are sequence-like.


"MultiValue"
============

class class MultiValue(value=Unspecified, **kw)

   Bases: "flatland.schema.containers.Array",
   "flatland.schema.scalars.Scalar"

   A transparent homogeneous Container, for multivalued form elements.

   MultiValues combine aspects of "Scalar" and "Sequence" fields,
   allowing all values of a repeated "(key, value)" pair to be
   captured and used.

   MultiValues take on the name of their child and have no identity of
   their own when flattened.  Elements are mostly sequence-like and
   can be indexed and iterated. However the "u" or "value" are scalar-
   like, and return values from the first element in the sequence.

   u

      The .u of the first item in the sequence, or u''.

   value

      The .value of the first item in the sequence, or None.
