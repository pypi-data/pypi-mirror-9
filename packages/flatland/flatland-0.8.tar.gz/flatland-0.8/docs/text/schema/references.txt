   adapt(value)

      Given any object *obj*, try to coerce it into native format.

      Returns:
         the native format or raises AdaptationError on failure.

      This abstract method is called by "set()".

   serialize(value)

      Given any object *obj*, coerce it into a text representation.

      Returns:
         **Must** return a Unicode text object, always.

      No special effort is made to coerce values not of native or a
      compatible type.

      This semi-abstract method is called by "set()".  The base
      implementation returns "str(obj)" (or unicode).

   u

      The text representation of the reference target.

   value

      The native value representation of the reference target.
