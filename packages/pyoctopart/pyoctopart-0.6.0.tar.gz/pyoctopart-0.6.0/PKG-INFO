        # pyoctopart
        
        A simple Python client frontend to the Octopart public REST API.
        
        For detailed API documentation, refer to the [Octopart APIv2 documentation](https://octopart.com/api/docs/v2/rest-api)
        
        This is a fork of [Joe Baker](https://github.com/jbaker0428/Python-Octopart-API)'s work, and this fork is *incompatible* with Python 2 distributions!
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Install
        
        just do:
        
            python3 setup.py install
        
        and it'll be available from your python REPL:
        
            % python3
            >>> from pyoctopart.octopart import Octopart
            >>> o = Octopart.api(apikey="yourapikey")
        
        when the lib will be considered stable enough, I'll upload it to [pipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=pkg_edit&name=pyoctopart):
        
            % pip install pyoctopart
        
        ### Develop
        
        if you just want to develop, you can do:
        
            % buildout
        
        which will download dependencies and deploy a python command in `bin/`:
        
            % bin/python3
            >>> from pyoctopart.octopart import Octopart
            >>> o = Octopart.api(apikey="yourapikey")
            
        You can run regression tests using:
        
            % bin/test
        
        ## Notes
        
        ### method/argument syntax
        
        There are a number of arguments in the Octopart API documentation which contain 
        periods in their names. When passing these arguments from Python, substitute an
        underscore for any periods.
        
        Similarly, substitute underscores for backslashes in method names.
        
        For example:
        
            >>> o = Octopart()
            >>> o.parts_get(1881614252472, optimize.hide_datasheets=True)
            SyntaxError: keyword can't be an expression
        
            Instead, pass the argument as:
            >>> o.parts_get(1881614252472, optimize_hide_datasheets=True)
        
        The library will perform the translation internally.
        
        ### Roadmap
        
         * [x] switch to python 3
         * [x] create buildout build
         * [x] use function annotations
         * [ ] switch to v3 API
         * [ ] improve and fix tests
