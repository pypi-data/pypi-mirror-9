        About this package
        ==================
        
        This package is a total dummy package. Don't use it in any real apps.
        It exists for the purpose of demonstrating what a vulnerable/malicious
        dependency could be like.
        
        During the web security tutorial, pretend this is a real package and you
        actually need it for the web app in question.
