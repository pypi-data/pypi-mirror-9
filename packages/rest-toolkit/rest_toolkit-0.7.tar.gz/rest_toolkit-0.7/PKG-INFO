Description: *rest_toolkit* is a Python package which provides a very convenient way to
        build REST servers. It is build on top of
        `Pyramid <http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about>`_, but you do not
        need to know much about Pyramid to use rest_toolkit.
        
        
        Quick example
        =============
        
        This is a minimal example which defines a ``Root`` resource with a ``GET``
        view, and starts a simple HTTP server. If you run this example you can request
        ``http://localhost:8080/`` and you will see a JSON response with a status
        message.
        
        ::
        
           from rest_toolkit import quick_serve
           from rest_toolkit import resource
        
        
           @resource('/')
           class Root(object):
               def __init__(self, request):
                   pass
        
        
           @Root.GET()
           def show_root(root, request):
               return {'status': 'OK'}

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.7 - March 12, 2015
        --------------------
        
        - Fix editing of SQL resource.
        
        - Update default views and validation extensions not to assume anything about
          the ``to_dict()`` return format.
        
        - If the ``rest_toolkit.debug`` is set, or the ``REST_TOOLKIT_DEBUG``
          environment variable is set to ``true``, or the pyramid's debug-all flag is
          set the system error exception handler will add the exception traceback to
          the response under a new ``traceback`` key.
        
        - Add basic support for collection resources. These can handle ``POST``
          requests to create child objects.
        
        
        0.6 - November 4, 2014
        ----------------------
        
        - Make sure controllers for resource whose path do not end in a slash are
          reachable.  This fixes `issue 12
          <https://github.com/wichert/rest_toolkit/issues/12>`_.
        
        - Fix mismatch between code and documentation: use ``request_method``
          as parameter name for the ``controller`` decorator.
        
        
        0.5 - October 24, 2014
        ----------------------
        
        - Allow overriding the request method for controllers. This fixes
          `issue 10 <https://github.com/wichert/rest_toolkit/issues/10>`_.
        
        - Add ``read_permission``, ``update_permission`` and ``delete_permission``
          options to the ``resource`` decorator to set permissions for default views.
          This fixes `issue 8 <https://github.com/wichert/rest_toolkit/issues/8>`_.
        
        - Rely on fixtures provided by pyramid_sqlalchemy for our SQL-related tests.
        
        - Preserve headers when converting a HTTP response to JSON. This fixes
          `issue 6 <https://github.com/wichert/rest_toolkit/issues/6>`_.
        
        - The route name for a resource can now be configured with a ``route_name`` parameter
          for the ``resource`` decorator.
        
        
        0.4.1 - July 18, 2014
        ---------------------
        
        - Make sure all raised HTTP exceptions are converted to JSON responses.
        
        
        0.4 - July 18, 2014
        -------------------
        
        This releases focuses on improving the documentation and fixing problems in the
        SQL extension.
        
        - Fix several errors in the SQLResource defaults views.
        
        - Configuring the SQL extension is no longer necessary if you use
          `pyramid_sqlalchemy <https://pyramid-sqlalchemy.readthedocs.org>`_ to handle
          SQLAlchemy integration.
        
        - `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/wichert/pyramid_sqlalchemy>`_ is now setup to
          automatically run tests on CPython 2.7, CPython 3.3, CPython 3.4 and PyPy.
        
        - Fix Python 3 compatibility problem in the generic error view.
        
        - Drop explicit Python 2.6 support. The tests use too many set literals to make
          Python 2.6 worthwile.
        
        - Modify EditableResource to not inherit from ViewableResource. This makes
          the separation between editing and viewing explicit, and works around the
          inability of Python to handle the inheritance schemes where a base classes 
          is used multiple times.
        
        - Remove the default value for ``replace`` in
          ``EditableResource.updat_from_dict()``. This did not serve a useful purpose,
          and could be confusing.
        
        - Set ``self.request`` in SQLResource constructor.
        
        
        0.3 - July 11, 2014
        -------------------
        
        This release fixes several critical errors in the SQL extension:
        
        - Fix the invoction of the context query.
        
        - Return not-found error from SQLResource instead of an internal error when no
          SQL row could be found.
        
        - Do not enable default views for SQLResource automatically. This should be
          an explicit decision by the user.
        
        
        0.2.2 - July 11, 2014
        ---------------------
        
        - Fix several errors in SQL extension.
        
        
        0.2.1 - July 10, 2014
        ---------------------
        
        - Add a MANIFEST.in to the source distribution installable.

        - Several demos showing how to use rest_toolkit with AngularJS have been added.
        
        - Support for default DELETE, GET, PATCH and PUT views has been added.
