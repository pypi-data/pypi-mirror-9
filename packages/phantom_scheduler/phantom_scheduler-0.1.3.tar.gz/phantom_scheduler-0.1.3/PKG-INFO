Description: ==============
        Phantom Scheduler
        ==============
        
        Phantom scheduler used to administer the job submission to clusters.
        
        "With great power comes great responsibility" -- Uncle Ben
        
        This program runs a scheduler and a number of children that keep submitting jobs to a cluster queue.
        
        It is particularly useful when one has many short jobs which cannot be submitted all at once. This permits not to lose the priority in the queue.
