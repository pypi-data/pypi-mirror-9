        ===========
        SMPy is a Python front-end alternative to the SurveyMan Language and Runtime System. It is an intuitive way to
        programmatically generate SurveyMan survey instances. SMPy outputs a JSON representation of a survey that can be
        parsed by the SurveyMan Language and deployed by the Runtime System.
