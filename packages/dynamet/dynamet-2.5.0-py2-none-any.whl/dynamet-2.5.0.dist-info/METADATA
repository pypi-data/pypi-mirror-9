DynaMet is a fully automated workflow for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) raw
data analyses allowing for metabolome-wide investigations of dynamic isotope labeling experiments. 
DynaMet enables untargeted extraction of labeling profiles by grouping metabolite features 
in different samples with isotopic patterns changing over time. 
Moreover, integrated tools for expressive data visualization enhance result inspection 
and manual reprocessing.
