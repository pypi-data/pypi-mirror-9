Description: pyin
        ====
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geowurster/pyin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geowurster/pyin) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/geowurster/pyin/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/geowurster/pyin?branch=master)
        
        Perform Python operations on every line read from `stdin`.  Every line is
        evaluated individually and available via a variable called `line`.
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Via pip:
        
            $ pip install git+https://github.com/geowurster/pyin.git
        
        From master branch:
            
            $ git clone https://github.com/geowurster/pyin
            $ pip install -e .
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Change newline character in a CSV.
        
            $ more sample-data/csv-with-header.csv | pyin "line.replace('\n', '\r\n')" > output.csv
        
        Extract a BigQuery schema from an existing table and pretty print it:
        
        ```console
        $ bq show --format=json ${DATASET}.${TABLE} | pyin -m json -m pprint "pprint.pformat(json.loads(line)['schema']['fields'])"
        [{u'mode': u'NULLABLE', u'name': u'mmsi', u'type': u'STRING'},
        {u'mode': u'NULLABLE', u'name': u'longitude', u'type': u'FLOAT'},
        {u'mode': u'NULLABLE', u'name': u'latitude', u'type': u'FLOAT'}
        ...]
        ```
        
        
        Gotchas
        -------
        
        It's easy to completely modify the line content:
        
            $ pyin -i sample-data/csv-with-header.csv "'operation'"
            operationoperationoperationoperationoperationoperation
        
        Forgetting to use `-t` to only get lines that evaluate as `True`:
        
            $ pyin -i LICENSE.txt "'are' in line"
            FalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseTrueFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseTrueFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalseFalse
            
            $ pyin -i LICENSE.txt "'are' in line" -t
