Version 0.5.1
I fiddled around with the drummode again :-(
- claves moved to poly. I think they should be there rather than with drummode. Drummode controls bassdrum and snare, so it made no sense that I controlled cymbal claves by drummode. 
- new poly modes 10 and 11 are claves now and they work both for onbeat and offbeat
- polyrhythmic cymbals (poly parameter) work now for onbeat drums too
- drummode 1 is now halftime mode for onbeat drums
- drummode 4 is now funky drumline for onbeat drums
- new harmonymode 7 will generate a riff with chords rather than single notes

Version 0.5
a lot has happened in the cymbal and percussion department :-)
- 2-3 (mode 1) and 3-2 (mode 4) clave in onbeat drumming played by the ride cymbal.
- switched from high-hat to ride cymbal for offbeat drumming.
- new parameter "poly". It controls the swing feeling of the cymbals (in all meters). It can even generate complex counterrhythms like 13 over 4 (in 4/4 time only). Only in offbeat mode.
- new percussion parameter "percbeat" to control the rhythm of the percussion. Claves for bongos and congas as well as complex counterrhythms. (in 4/4 time only)
- more than one random chord per bar.
- 10/4, 12/4 and 16/4 for Indian rhythms (Japhtaal, Ektaal, Teentaal) allowed, but no raga rhythm rendering.

Version 0.4.4
- improved random chord progressions for non-major keys
- new parameter to show random progressions (-p)

Version 0.4.3
- fixed missing bar separator for empty bar in instrument Right
- fixed synthMode output for older lilypond versions (underscore in name)	

Version 0.4.2
- new parameter synthMode. 0 is like previous versions (sax,trumpet & piano), 1 = all synths

Version 0.4.1
- new melody option 6 = piano solo without counterpoint
- new harmony option 6 = chords on downbeats without riff
- new harmony option 99 - no chords and no riff
- new song tag harmoniesStaff - 0 is bass staff (as till V0.4), 1 = violin staff
- new xml tag percussion, 0 = bongos, 1 = congas, 99 = default
- new option -u / --update to update the xml file.
- new tests for new features
- documentation updates
- allow non-Lilypond scales for random melody generation
- made the blues scales hexatonic

Version 0.4
- xml tag melody = generate random melodies with or without counterpoint
- when tag progressions is left blank, the program generates random progressions
- generate a different riff for each part
- reordering of staves
- made ptempo a comment in template xml
- new tests for new features
- documentation updates
- use flat notes instead of sharp notes for flat keys

Version 0.3
- new option -s/--show which prints out all the valid chords for a given scale
- allow 8 as denominator in time signature. New tag time in xml which overwrites quarters.
- walking bass uses quavers if the denominator is 8.
- additions and corrections in documentation.
- allow more than two chords per bar.
- move chords with g or higher as root one octave down to prevent collisions with riff.
- harmony mode for the lower piano voice. You can choose between chords (default) and arpeggio (NoteUp, NoteDown, Random).
- another correction for odd bar counts, set rests in last bar in upper piano voice.
- split LyMak.py into 5 source files.
- new tests for new features

Version 0.2.1
- added mp3 examples to setup
- minor corrections in documentation
- downbeats in xml can now be empty, program will decide what to choose.
- correct downbeats in asXml.
- change downbeats automatically when setting quarters
- unit test
- bass and drum modes as parameters for asXml (because of unit test)
- correct midi instruments for synths
- add 4/4 drum roll only for 4/4 time
- check quarters
- moved all functinality to package LyMaker

Version 0.2
- do not set riff for the last bar of a part if the part has an odd number of bars.
- different tempo can now be inserted for each part
- generate no rests in chord list because Lilypond 2.18 will write N.C into the score (2.12 didn't do this).
- new drum mode (5) for generating a drum pattern.
- mode 99 mutes the bass.
