.. class:: infomark

   **What it does**

The tool takes as input a BCF file produced by the *Variant Calling* tool, and calculates per-chromosome read coverage from it.

.. class:: warningmark

   The tool treats genome positions missing from the BCF input as zero coverage, so it is safe to use ONLY with BCF files produced by the *Variant Calling* tool or through other commands that keep the information for all sites.
