   **What it does**

The tool filters a variant file in VCF format to generate a new VCF file with only a subset of the original variants.

The following types of variant filters can be set up:

1) Sample-specific filters:
   
   Filter variants based on their characteristics in the sequenced reads of a specific sample. Multiple sample-specific filters are combined by logical AND, i.e., only variants that pass ALL sample-specific filters are kept.
   
2) Region filters:
   
   Filter variants based on the genomic region they affect. Multiple region filters are combined by logical OR, i.e., variants passing ANY region filter are kept.
   
3) Variant type filter:

   Filter variants by their type, i.e. whether they are single nucleotide variations (SNVs) or indels
   
In addition, the *sample* filter can be used to reduce the samples encoded in a multi-sample VCF file to just those specified by the filter.
The *sample* filter is included mainly for compatibility reasons: if an external tool cannot deal with the multisample file format, but instead looks only at the first sample-specific column of the file, you can use the filter to turn the multi-sample file into a single-sample file. Besides, the filter can also be used to change the order of the samples since it will sort the samples in the order specified in the filter field.

**Examples of sample-specific filters:**

*Simple genotype pattern*

genotype pattern: 1/1 ==> keep all variants in the vcf input file for which the specified sample's genotype is homozygous mutant

*Complex genotype pattern*

genotype pattern: 0/1, 0/0 ==> keep all variants for which the sample's genotype is either heterozygous or homozygous wildtype

*Multiple sample-specific filters*

Filter 1: genotype pattern: 0/0, Filter 2: genotype pattern 1/1:
==> keep all variants for which the first sample's gentoype is homozygous wildtype **and** the second sample's genotype is homozygous mutant

*Combining sample-specific filter criteria*

genotype pattern: 1/1, depth of coverage: 3, genotype quality: 9
==> keep variants for which the sample's genotype is homozygous mutant **and** for which this genotype assignment is corroborated by a genotype quality score of at least 9
**and** at least three reads from the sample cover the variant site

**TIP:**

As in the example above, genotype quality is typically most useful in combination with a genotype pattern.
It acts then, effectively, to make the genotype filter more stringent.
