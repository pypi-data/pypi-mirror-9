        BusinessTime is a simple utility for calculating business time aware timedeltas between two datetimes. BusinessTime's understanding of weekends, holidays and business hours can be easily configured in code.
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
            >>> datetime(2013, 12, 26, 5) - datetime(2013, 12, 23, 12)
            datetime.timedelta(2, 61200)
            >>> bt = businesstime.BusinessTime(holidays=businesstime.USFederalHolidays())
            >>> bt.businesstimedelta(datetime(2013, 12, 23, 12), datetime(2013, 12, 26, 5))
            datetime.timedelta(1, 18000)
