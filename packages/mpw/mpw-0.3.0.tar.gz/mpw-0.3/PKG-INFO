Description: Master Password
        ===============
        
        This is a Python implementation of the `Master Password algorithm`__ by
        `Maarten Billemont`__. It also comes with a command line interface that lets
        you compute passwords for your sites based on your master password.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package requires Python 3 (tested with 3.4) and uses scrypt__,
        cryptography__ (you need a compiler for both),  click__, and pyperclip__.
        
        Installation with `pip`__:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ pip install mpw
        
        Or better, use `pipsi`__:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ pipsi install --python `which python3` mpw
        
        This app copies the password to the clipboard. This should work out-of-the-box
        on OS X and Windows. On Linux, *mpw* makes use of the ``xclip`` or ``xsel`` commands, which should come with the os. Otherwise run:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ sudo apt-get install xclip
           $ # or
           $ sudo apt-get install xsel
        
        Alternatively, the gtk or PyQT4 modules can be installed.
        
        Binary executables (e.g., an installer for Windows) may follow.

        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ # Add a user
           $ mpw adduser Alice
           Enter master password:
           Confirm master password:
           Added user "Alice".
           # Add a site for Alice
           $ mpw addsite test-site
           Enter master password for "Alice":
           Added site "test-site" for user "Alice".
           $ # Actually get the password
           $ mpw get test-site
           Enter master password for "Alice":
           Password for "test-site" for user "Alice" was copied to the clipboard.
           $ # You can also pipe a password to other commands:
           $ mpw get -e server-root | sudo -S vim /etc/crontab

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.3 – 2015-02-01
        ----------------
        
        - [CHANGE] ``mpw get`` no longer creates a user or site if they don't exist.
        - [CHANGE] New config file format.
        - [NEW] Support for multiple versions of the Master Password algorithm
        - [NEW] Implemented version 2 of the algorithm
        - [NEW] A hashed version of the master key is stored on disk to notify you if
          you make typos.
        - [NEW] The users' sites are now being encrypted on disk
        - [NEW] Users can now change their master password
        - [NEW] Passwords can now be echoed to ``stdout`` and thus be piped to other
          commands.
        - [NEW] Lots of test to ensure compatibility with the reference implementation
        - [NEW] 100% line and branch coverage
