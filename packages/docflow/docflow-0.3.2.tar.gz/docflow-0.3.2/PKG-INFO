Description: Docflow: Python Document Workflows
        ==================================
        
        Docflow is an implementation of document workflows in Python. A workflow
        defines `states` and `transitions`. A state is an “end point” associated with
        a document. A transition is a path from one state to another state
        (unidirectional). Docflow was inspired by `repoze.workflow`_ but aspires
        to be a framework-independent implementation.

        -----
        
        - Transition handlers can now connect multiple from/to states
        - New: transition_from for specifying a transition in reverse
        - New: interactive transitions with form/validate/submit methods
        - Python 3 compatibility
        - Support for multiple workflows per document class, with workflow names

        ---
        
        - States now remember the order in which they were defined, for UI purposes
        - Document sorting by workflow state
        - Helper method to list available transitions
        - Subclasses can now override workflow exceptions
          (for framework-specific Forbidden handlers)
