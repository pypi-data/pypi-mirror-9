0.x - DOCS: improve documentation status, 
      example of good status is the calculations or probabilities module
0.6 - test mvc distribution
0.7 - Sybilla Support:
        - export to Sybilla's XML format?
    - Create a SpecimensController (mind the s) that handles most of the specimen
      selection/deletion/creation control now in the Application and ProjectControllers.
      Could be similar to the PhasesController etc. (even though the views are a bit different) 
0.8 - implement new 'charge unit' algorithm
    - implement true PSO-CMA-ES hybrid algorithm
