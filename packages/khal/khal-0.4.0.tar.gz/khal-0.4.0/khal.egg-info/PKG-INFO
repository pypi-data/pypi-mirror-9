        *Khal* is a standards based CLI (console) calendar program. CalDAV_
        compatibility is achieved by using vdir_/vdirsyncer_ as a backend, `allowing
        syncing of calendars with a variety of other programs on a host of different
        platforms`__.

        Features
        --------
        (or rather: limitations)
        
        - khal can read and write events/icalendars to vdir_
        - fast and easy way to add new events
        - ikhal (interactive khal) lets you browse and edit calendars and events
        - support for recurring events is not complete yet, they cannot be deleted or
          edited and some recursion patterns are not understood
        - you cannot edit the timezones of events
        - khal should run on all major operating systems [1]_
        
        .. [1] except for Microsoft Windows
