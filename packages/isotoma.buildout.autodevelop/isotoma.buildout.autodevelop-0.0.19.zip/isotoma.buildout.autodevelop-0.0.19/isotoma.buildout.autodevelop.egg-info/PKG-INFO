Description: Autodevelop buildout extension
        ==============================
        
        This package provides a buildout_ extension for automatically developing source eggs
        in the current project.
        
        You might also want to look at mr.developer which does a similar job but also
        manages your SCM interactions, which autodevelop explicitly does NOT do.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Finding your develop eggs automatically
        ---------------------------------------
        
        You just need to add an extension to your buildout.cfg::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = isotoma.buildout.autodevelop
        
        By default this will check every directory below where you execute buildout for
        setup.py. Buildout managed directories like develop-eggs-directory will be excluded.
        If you want to further restrict the search path, you can till the extension where
        to search::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = isotoma.buildout.autodevelop
            autodevelop =
                src
                externals
        
        This will develop any source eggs contained in your src and externals directories.
        
        
        Testing 'real' eggs automatically
        ---------------------------------
        
        We package all our eggs and deploy from a local PyPI mirror. It's useful to be
        able to automatically run the egg build and test the buildout with that egg,
        rather than the checkout. You will flush out your MANIFEST problems if you make
        use of this.
        
        You need to put the extension into 'localeggs' mode::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = isotoma.buildout.autodevelop
        
            [autodevelop]
            mode = localeggs
        
        Under the hood, the extension will call ``python setup.py sdist`` for each egg
        that would have been developed and rewrites ``${buildout:find-links}`` to use
        that.
        
        
        Automatic version numbers
        -------------------------
        
        You probably won't want this, its a bit of an edge case.
        
        If you are deploying from an SVN tag that contains your source code but you
        want the deployment to use eggs from your PyPI mirror anyway then autodevelop
        can automatically update the pins in your buildout to match the version of the
        code in your tag, by rewriting the [versions] section of your config.
        
        This looks like this::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = isotoma.buildout.autodevelop
        
            [autodevelop]
             mode = deploy
        
        
        Optional Parameters
        -------------------
        
        autodevelop
            If you don't want to scan the entire checkout, provide a subfolder to check

        Changelog for isotoma.buildout.autodevelop
        ==========================================
        
        0.0.19 (2015-01-28)
        -------------------
        
        - Fix local egg mode on newer pythons.
        
        
        0.0.18 (2013-01-09)
        -------------------
        
        - Fix missing import.
        
        
        0.0.17 (2013-01-07)
        -------------------
        
        - Fix to work when setuptools is only available in bootstrapped environment.
          This happens when using python2.7 on lucid with deadsnakes repo without
          distribute package. This release lets it import the setuptools that you
          bootstrapped into your eggs-directory.
        
        
        0.0.16 (2012-12-31)
        -------------------
        
        - We do not autodevelop any "parts" directorys which means we need a list of
          part names to concatenate with the value of ``buildout:parts-directory``.
          Previously, this list was determined by evaluating ``${buildout:parts}``,
          however that didn't include parts that are pulled in automatically when
          referred to by other parts. Instead, we now get a list of part names by
          inspecting ``buildout.keys()``, filtered down to which of those parts have an
          assigned ``recipe``.
        
        
        0.0.15 (2012-03-01)
        -------------------
