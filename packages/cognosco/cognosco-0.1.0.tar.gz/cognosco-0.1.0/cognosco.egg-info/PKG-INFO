Description: =============================
        Cognosco Pull Request Auditor
        =============================
        
        Cognosco is a command line tool for auditing the merged pull requests
        on Github or Github Enterprise, using the Github API.  It generates a
        report of all policy violations for all the repositories it was
        requested to examine.  Each pull request is listed with a link to the
        pull request, as well as an indication of which policy rules were
        violated.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Cognosco uses ``cli_tools``, and so provides extensive help text,
        accessible by using the "--help" argument.  The primary arguments it
        needs have to do with authenticating to Github (see the help for
        "--username", "--password", and "--github-url"; note that cognosco
        will prompt for a password if none is provided).
        
        Cognosco also must be told which repositories to examine; this is done
        by passing one or more of the "--repo", "--user", or "--org" options.
        (Note that cognosco will generate an empty report if none of these
        options are passed.)  Any mix of these options may be used; cognosco
        will explore all listed repositories, and all repositories it can see
        under the listed users or organizations.
