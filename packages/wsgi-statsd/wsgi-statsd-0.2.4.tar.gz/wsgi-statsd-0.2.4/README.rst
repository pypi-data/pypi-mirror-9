wsgi_statsd is a WSGI middleware that provides an easy way to time all requests.
Integration is as easy as just wrapping your existing wsgi application.

.. contents::


Usage
-----

In your wsgi.py file wrap your WSGI application as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import statsd
    from wsgi_statsd import StatsdTimingMiddleware


    def application(environ, start_response):
        response_body = 'The request method was %s' % environ['REQUEST_METHOD']
        status = '200 OK'
        response_headers = [('Content-Type', 'text/plain'),
                            ('Content-Length', str(len(response_body)))]

        start_response(status, response_headers)

        return [response_body]

    client = statsd.StatsClient(
        prefix='your_prefix',
        host='your_host',
        port=8125
    )

    application = StatsdTimingMiddleware(application, client)

.. note::

    If an unhandled exception happens, it will not be timed by default.
    This is a design decision to separate error reporting and actual statistical measurements.
    To enable exception timing, pass `time_exception=True` to the middleware constructor:


.. code-block:: python

    application = StatsdTimingMiddleware(application, client, time_exceptions=True)


What it does
------------

The middleware uses the statsd timer function, using the environ['PATH_INFO'], environ['REQUEST_METHOD'] and
the status code variables as the name for the key and the amount of time the request took as the value.

If you want more granular reporting you'll have to work with the ``prefix`` argument. You can pass any string you want
and the middleware will pass it along to statsd.

Using the ``foo`` prefix and calling the ``www.spam.com/bar`` page will result in ``foo_bar_GET_200`` having a value
equal to the time it took to handle the request.

If you passed `time_exceptions=True` and exception happened during the response, then the key name will be postfixed
with the exception class name: ``foo_bar_GET_500_ValueError``

.. note::

    wsgi-statsd uses underscores as a separator for the key that is sent to statsd as that makes it easy to retrieve the
    data from graphite. You can override this default by passing a ``separator`` value to the middleware constructor:


.. code-block:: python

    StatsdTimingMiddleware(application, client, separator='.')



Customizing for your needs
--------------------------

It's possible to customize the way ``wsgi_statsd`` generates the key and/or time. ``StatsdTimingMiddleware`` has
``send_stats`` and ``get_key_name`` which you can override:

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomStatsdMiddleware(StatsdTimingMiddleware):

        def get_key_name(self, environ, response_interception):
            return super(self, CustomStatsdMiddleware).get_key_name(environ, response_interception) + '.' + environ['Transfer-Encoding']


        def send_stats(self, start, environ, response_interception):
            super(self, CustomStatsdMiddleware).send_stats(start + 10, environ, response_interception)
