        Static analysis tool for python programs to see depending lines of code.
        
        .. note:: The Python program ``programslice`` in itself is rather
           useless for the end user. Use it with the `Vim editor plugin
           <https://github.com/romanofski/programslice.vim>`__. See Installation
           for more information.

        Why Using Programslice
        ======================
        
        The main benefits of the program are:
        
        * the possibility to aid tracing the control flow of the program
        
        * find variables that are unnecessary to the program state
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Requirements: Python 2.7
        
        * Install `programslice` first in your favourite virtualenv::
        
            $ pip install https://github.com/romanofski/programslice/archive/master.zip
        
        * Install the Vim plugin by following the instructions on it's `github
          page <https://github.com/romanofski/programslice.vim>`_.
        
        * Once the plugin is installed, either make sure that the
          ``programslice`` command is in your ``$PATH`` variable or you adjust
          the ``g:programslice_cmd`` variable in your ``~/.vimrc`` to point it
          to the executable.
