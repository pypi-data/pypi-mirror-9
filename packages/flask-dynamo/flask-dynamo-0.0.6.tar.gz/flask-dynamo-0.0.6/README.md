## Purpose

I love using Amazon's [DynamoDB][] database -- it's incredibly fast, infinitely
scalable, and has a beautifully simple API.

Of all the NoSQL databases that exist, Dynamo is the simplest to deploy and run
in high-traffic production environments, and incredibly simple to get started
with / grow into.

I've been using it for several years now, and couldn't be happier.

The only problem I had using Dynamo with Flask is lack of an official extension
-- so I created one!

This extension makes working with Dynamo in Flask projects simple and painless
-- and doesn't get in your way at all (*no need to compromise!*).
