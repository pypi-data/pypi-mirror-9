"""
The :py:mod:`py2deb.tests` module contains the automated tests for `py2deb`.

The makefile in the py2deb git repository uses pytest_ to run the test suite
because of pytest's great error reporting. Nevertheless the test suite is
written to be compatible with the :py:mod:`unittest` module (part of Python's
standard library) so that the test suite can be run without additional external
dependencies.

        Test the handling of race conditions in :py:mod:`proc.core`.

        Scanning ``/proc`` is inherently vulnerable to race conditions, for
        example:

        1. A listing of available processes in ``/proc`` confirms a process
           exists, but by the time ``/proc/[pid]/stat`` is read the process has
           ended and ``/proc/[pid]`` no longer exists.

        2. A :py:class:`proc.core.Process` object is constructed from the
           information available in ``/proc/[pid]/stat``, but by the time
           ``/proc/[pid]/cmdline`` is read the process has ended and
           ``/proc/[pid]`` no longer exists.

        This test intentionally creates race conditions in the reading of
        ``/proc/[pid]/stat`` and ``/proc/[pid]/cmdline`` files, to verify that
        the :py:mod:`proc.core` module never breaks on a race condition.

        It works by using the :py:mod:`multiprocessing` module to quickly spawn
        and reclaim subprocesses while at the same time scanning through
        ``/proc`` continuously. The test times out after 60 seconds but in all
