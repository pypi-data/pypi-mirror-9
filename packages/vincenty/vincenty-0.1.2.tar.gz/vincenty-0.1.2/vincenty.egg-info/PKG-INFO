Description: This library implements Vincenty's solution to the inverse geodetic problem. It
        is based on the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid and is accurate to within 1 mm (!) or
        better.
        
        This formula is widely used in geographic information systems (GIS) and is much
        more accurate than methods for computing the great-circle distance (which assume
        a spherical Earth).
        
        
        Example: distance between Boston and New York City
        
        >>> from vincenty import vincenty
        >>> boston = (42.3541165, -71.0693514)
        >>> newyork = (40.7791472, -73.9680804)
        >>> vincenty(boston, newyork)
        298.396057
        >>> vincenty(boston, newyork, miles=True)
        185.414657
        
        
        Installation
