        Introduction
        ============
        
        Extends dexterity.localroles:
        
        * provides a principal selector field
        * extends the configuration page
        
        When giving local roles, the principal is selected by a field on the object.
        
        The assignement is then different for each object following the selected principal.
        
        This is a refactoring of collective.z3cform.rolefield.
