        Bade is a small command line utility to allow the user to maintain a simple
        HTML website and weblog using only plaintext rST for their content. It also
        bundles an rST directive (see `the docs`_) for rendering DOT graphs as SVG.
        
        It's very similar in spirit to some other things. It's like Pelican_ but it's a
        lot simpler and uses Mako_ instead of Jinja2_. It's also like Tinkerer_ but
        without the dependency on Sphinx_.
        
        Bade is opinionated and simplistic, I wrote it mostly my own usage, so you
        probably shouldn't use it.

        Plans to extend
        ===============
        In writing Bade, I came up with a few things more I'd like to do:
        
            - **Test suite**: Everything should be tested, right?
            - **Git integration**: For dirty checking on build, maybe stamping a
              rendered file with its latest commit hash. There are `a few`_ GitHub
              `issues`_ for it.
            - **Hooks**: Let people hook in at interesting points, ie. call ``grunt``
              pre-build, commit after build, etc.
