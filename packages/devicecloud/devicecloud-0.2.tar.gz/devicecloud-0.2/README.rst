Be sure to check out the `full
documentation <http://etherios.github.io/python-devicecloud>`__. A
`Changelog <https://github.com/etherios/python-devicecloud/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`__
is also available.

Overview
--------

Python-devicecloud is a library providing simple, intuitive access to
the `Device Cloud by
Etherios <http://www.etherios.com/products/devicecloud/>`__ for clients
written in Python.

The library wraps the Device Cloud REST API and hides the details of
forming HTTP requests in order to gain access to device information,
file data, streams, and other features of the device cloud. The API
wrapped can be found
`here <http://ftp1.digi.com/support/documentation/90002008_redirect.htm>`__.

The primary target audience for this library is individuals interfacing
with the device cloud from the server side or developers writing tools
to aid device development. For efficient connectivity from devices, we
suggest that you first look at using the `Device Cloud
Connector <http://www.etherios.com/products/devicecloud/connector>`__.
That being said, this library could also be used on devices if deemed
suitable.

Example
-------

The library provides access to a wide array of features, but here is a
couple quick examples to give you a taste of what the API looks like.

.. code:: python

    from devicecloud import DeviceCloud

    dc = DeviceCloud('user', 'pass')

    # show the MAC address of all devices that are currently connected
    #
    # This is done using the device cloud DeviceCore functionality
    print "== Connected Devices =="
    for device in dc.devicecore.get_devices():
        if device.is_connected():
            print device.get_mac()

    # get the name and current value of all data streams having values
    # with a floating point type
    #
    # This is done using the device cloud stream functionality
    for stream in dc.streams.get_streams():
        if stream.get_data_type().lower() in ('float', 'double'):
            print "%s -> %s" % (stream.get_stream_id(), stream.get_current_value())

the `Full API
Documentation <https://etherios.github.io/python-devicecloud>`__.

Installation
------------

This library can be installed using
`pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`__. Python versions 2.7+ (including
Python 3) are supported by the library.

.. code:: sh

    pip install devicecloud

If you already have an older version of the library installed, you can
upgrade to the latest version by doing

.. code:: sh

    pip install --upgrade devicecloud

Supported Features
------------------

Eventually, it is hoped that there will be complete feature parity
between the device cloud API and this library. For now, however, that is
not the case. The current features are supported by the library:

-  Getting basic device information via DeviceCore
-  Listing devices associated with a device cloud account
-  Interacting with Device Cloud Data Streams
-  Create Streams
-  Get Stream (by id)
-  List all streams
-  Get metadata for a stream
-  Write a single datapoint to a stream
-  Write many datapoints to a stream (homogeneous bulk write)
-  Write many datapoints to multiple streams (heterogeneous bulk write)
-  Read data points from a stream (includes control over order of
   returned data set as well as allowing for retrieving data roll-ups,
   etc.)
-  Support for accessing Device Cloud FileData store
-  Get filedata matching a provided condition (path, file extension,
   size, etc.)
-  Write files to filedata store
-  Recursively walk filedata directory tree from some root location
-  Get full metadata and contents of files and directories.
-  Low level support for performing basic SCI commands with limited
   parsing of results and support for only a subset of available
   services/commands.
-  APIs to make direct web service calls to the device cloud with some
   details handled by the library (see DeviceCloudConnection and 'ws'
   documentation)

The following features are *not* supported at this time. Feedback on
which features should be highest priority is always welcome.

-  Alarms
-  Monitors
-  Scheduled Operations
-  Creating a TCP or HTTP monitor
-  Asynchronous SCI requests
-  High level access to many SCI/RCI operations
-  DeviceMetaData
-  DeviceVendor
-  FileDataHistory
-  NetworkInterface support
-  XBee specific support (XBeeCore)
-  Device Provisioning
-  Smart Energy APIs
-  SMS Support
-  Satellite/Iridium Support
-  SM/UDP Support
-  Carrier Information Access
