    You can replace this template in your own project, and
    override stuff from standalone-base-internal.django.html.
    This means that you can put ``django_cradmin/standalone-base.django.html``
    in your own project, and override it without having to reimplement
    anything.

    We will NEVER add anything to this template by default.
