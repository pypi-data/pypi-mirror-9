Description: 
        `pycotap` is a simple Python test runner for ``unittest`` that outputs 
        `Test Anything Protocol <http://testanything.org>`_ results to standard output 
        (similar to what `tape <https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape>`_ does for JavaScript).
        
        Contrary to other TAP runners for Python, ``pycotap`` ...
        
        - ... prints TAP (and *only* TAP) to standard output instead of to a separate file,
          allowing you to pipe it directly to TAP pretty printers and processors 
          (such as the ones listed on
          `the tape page <https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape#pretty-reporters>`_). By
          piping it to other consumers, you can avoid the need to add 
          specific test runners to your test code. Since the TAP results
          are printed as they come in, the consumers can directly display results while 
          the tests are run.
        
        - ... only contains a TAP reporter, so no parsers, no frameworks, no dependencies, ...
        
        Documentation and examples can be found on `the pycotap page 
        <https://el-tramo.be/pycotap>`_.
