Description: **moecache** is a pure python client for memcached.  Its binary
        protocol and shading strategy are compatible with EnyimMemcached
        (a C# memcached client), so that you are can read/write an
        EnyimMemcached-managed memcached deployment in Python.
        
        The project is forked from **memcache_client**, a minimal and robust
        python memcached client from Mixpanel, Inc.
        
        The API looks very similar to the other memcached clients:
        
        ::
        
            import moecache
        
            with moecache.Client([("127.0.0.1", 11211), ("127.0.0.1", 11213)],
                                 timeout=1, connect_timeout=5) as mc:
                mc.set("some_key", "Some value")
                value = mc.get("some_key")
                mc.delete("another_key")
