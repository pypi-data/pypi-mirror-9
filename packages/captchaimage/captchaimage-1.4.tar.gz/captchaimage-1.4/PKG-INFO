Description: python-captchaimage is a fast and easy to use Python extension for creating images with distorted text that are easy for humans and difficult for computers to read. Glyphs are loaded as bezier curves using Freetype, rotated and scaled randomly, and then distorted by adding Perlin noise to each point of the curve before rendering into a bitmap.
