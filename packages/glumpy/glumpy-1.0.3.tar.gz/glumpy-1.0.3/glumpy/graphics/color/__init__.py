"""
A Color is represented using four normalized channels (red, green, blue and
alpha). Alpha encodes the transparency of the color, with 0 being fully
transparent and 1 being fully opaque.

A single color can be manipulated using the Color object while for sequence of
several color, the Colors object is best.

Example usage:
--------------

color = Color("white")
colors = Colors(["black", "gray", "white"])
