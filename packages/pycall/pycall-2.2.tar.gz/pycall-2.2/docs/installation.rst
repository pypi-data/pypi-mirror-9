Installation
============

pycall can be installed just like any other python program, through `pypi
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_. To install it, simply run::

    $ pip install pycall

If you'd like to install the latest development version of pycall (not
recommended), then `download the latest release
<https://github.com/rdegges/pycall>`_ and run::

    $ python setup.py install

If you're totally unfamiliar with installing python packages, you should
probably read the `official tutorial
<http://wiki.python.org/moin/CheeseShopTutorial>`_ before continuing.
