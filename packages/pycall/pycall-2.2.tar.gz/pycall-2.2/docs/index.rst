pycall
======

Welcome to pycall's documentation. This documentation is divided into several
different parts, and can be read through like a book. If you're relatively new
to telephony, you may want to start at the :ref:`foreword`, and read through
to the end; otherwise, you can jump right into the :ref:`usage` docs.

If you want to contribute code to the project, please read the *entire*
:ref:`developing` section before diving into the code.
