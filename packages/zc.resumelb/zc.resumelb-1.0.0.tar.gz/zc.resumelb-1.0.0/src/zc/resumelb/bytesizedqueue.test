byte-sized queues
=================

Internally, we have greenlets that handle communication over the
multiplexed lb<->worker socket and pass data to and from request
handlers::

              - read queue <-- read greenlet <-
             /                                  \
   handler <-                   -----------> socket
      \                       /
        -> write queue -> write greenled

Read queues are per worker.  The write queue is shared.  The read
greenlet reads messages from the socket. Each message has a request
number, which is used to look up a handler read queue.

We limit write queue size to prevent storing lots of data in memory.
When no more data can be written to the socket, we want to block
handlers from adding more data to the queue.

It's important though to limit by bytes, rather than by message count.
We use ByteSizedQueue for this:

    >>> import zc.resumelb.util
    >>> q = zc.resumelb.util.ByteSizedQueue(999999)

    >>> q.put('a'*900000, False)
    >>> q.put('b'*99990, False)
    >>> q.put('c'*99990, False)
    >>> q.put('d'*99990, False)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Full

    >>> q.qsize()
    1099980

Note that the queue size is actually greater than the max size.  We
don't raise full unless the size is greater than or equal to the max
size before adding an item.

    >>> q.get() == 'a'*900000
    True
    >>> q.put('d'*99990, False)
    >>> q.put('a'*900000, False)
    >>> q.put('x'*900000, False)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Full

    >>> q.get() == 'b'*99990
    True
    >>> q.get() == 'c'*99990
    True
    >>> q.get() == 'd'*99990
    True
    >>> q.qsize()
    900000

Empty strings
-------------

There's a corner case when a queue contains just empty strings.  At
that point, it's byte size is 0, but it's queue size must be positive,
or get will block.  For that reason, the queue will walways have an
non-zeo queue size when there are items in it.

    >>> q.put('')
    >>> q.get() == 'a'*900000
    True
    >>> q.qsize() > 0
    True

    >>> q.put('')
    >>> q.qsize() > 0
    True
    >>> q.get()
    ''
    >>> q.qsize() > 0
    True
    >>> q.get()
    ''
    >>> q.qsize()
    0

None
----

None is counted as an empty string:

    >>> q.put(None)
    >>> q.qsize() > 0
    True
    >>> q.put('hi')
    >>> q.qsize()
    2

Actually, anything false is:

    >>> q.put([])
    >>> q.qsize()
    2
