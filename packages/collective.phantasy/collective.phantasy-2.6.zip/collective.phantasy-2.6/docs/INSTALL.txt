collective.phantasy Installation
================================

To install collective.phantasy into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* When you're reading this you have probably already run
  ``easy_install collective.phantasy``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

* If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
  via::

       python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

  into your Zope instance.

* Create a file called ``collective.phantasy-configure.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

       <include package="collective.phantasy" />

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``collective.phantasy`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.phantasy

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        ...
        collective.phantasy

  If you don't want atfolder to be skinnable, add this :

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        ...
        collective.phantasy:minimal.zcml

* You can also make any content type skinnable, adding in a zcml file in your environment::

      <include package="collective.phantasy" file="minimal.zcml" />
      <class class="my.package.a.ContentType">
        <implements interface="collective.phantasy.atphantasy.extendcontents.skinextension.ISkinnable" />
      </class>

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.

INSTALL MODULE IN YOUR PLONE SITE
---------------------------------

If you want to install it as a standalone product, with examples,
go to Site Configuration > Modules and install 'Collective Phantasy with contents'.

If you don't want to install examples, import profile 'Collective Phantasy'
via Generic Setup (collective.phantasy:default profile).

If you want to install it as a dependency, use default profile, adding in your metadata.xml::

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<metadata>
  <version>...</version>
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>profile-collective.phantasy:default</dependency>
  </dependencies>
</metadata>
