* Waiting for Deco improvements to make a really cool product
  
* At this time all standard skin images are overloaded though css when
  these images are present in skin, excepted for portal_type icons,
  since generated.css is no more used in Plone.
  So we must patch getIcon method to get thes icons from phantasy skin
  if these icon exists.
