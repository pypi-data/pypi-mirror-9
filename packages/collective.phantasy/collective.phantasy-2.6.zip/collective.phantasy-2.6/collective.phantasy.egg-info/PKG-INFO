Description: Introduction :
        ==============
        
        Change the skin of your plone site, change the skin of any content based on ATFolder on the site,
        using a simple form.
        
        Just Upload images with the same name in the skin using a tgz or a zip,
        to overload standard plone skin images referenced in css.
        
        You can add a css for each skin.
        
        You can choose to overload, all parts, or just some parts, of the plone standard css.
        
        You can change Logo, Footer or Colophon viewlets using phantasy skin edit form.
        
        You can choose to display or not plone standard dynamic viewlets (searchbox, site actions ...)
        
        The viewlets configuration is taken from the first skin associated with a parent object.
        
        The css are taken from all skins associated with all parents.
        
        The static viewlets edition could be more easy for users if Products.FCKeditor
        is installed in Plone (the FCKwidget is used).
        
        You can add a favicon for each skin, uploading a favicon.ico file.
        
        Dependencies :
        ==============
        
        - Plone 4.0.x, Plone 4.1.x.
        
        - archetypes.schemaextender
          (used to add a referencefield to standard Plone Folders)
        
        - Products.SmartColorWidget
        
        All dependencies are installed when using buildout or easy_install.
        
        Installation :
        ==============
        
        read docs/INSTALL.txt inside product to install it in your Zope instance
        
        Then in your Plone Site, use portal_quick_installer to install it in Plone,
        this will also install Products.SmartColorWidget.
        
        
        FAQ :
        =====
        
        * How to make my own phantasy config and css ?
        
          Just look at the aws.minisite package code, it's a complete example which will show
          you how to make a new skin schema and how to override phantasy css. In aws.minisite
          you will also find a way to use collective.phantasy with a different
          strategy (the schema extender field is no more used, instead, when
          creating a new "Mini Site" you are invited to choose a skin, and this skin is
          copied/pasted inside the Mini Site. Then the Mini Site owner is able
          to change the mini site skin by himself.)
        
        
        ROADMAP :
        =========
        
        * Replace Archetypes Schema with a zope3 schema for skin data
          (no planning for now)

        * Fix ATContentTypes AutoOrderSupport import error with last ATContentTypes version

        0.4
        ---

        * added plone products dependencies in metadata.xml profile
        
        * removed import-steps.xml, importSteps handler added in profile.zcml
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        * Initial release
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        
        * Waiting for Deco improvements to make a really cool product
          
        * At this time all standard skin images are overloaded though css when
          these images are present in skin, excepted for portal_type icons,
          since generated.css is no more used in Plone.
          So we must patch getIcon method to get thes icons from phantasy skin
          if these icon exists.
