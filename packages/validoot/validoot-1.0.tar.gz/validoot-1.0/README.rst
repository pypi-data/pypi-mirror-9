validoot - 1.0
==============

This module is designed to solve the most basic of argument validations:
types, clauses, and combinations of clauses. It is meant to remove some
of the boiler plate code used to check the input types and checks such
as between, or string lengths.

Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Clause - A function that takes in the value as a parameter and
   returns ``True`` or ``False``.
-  Operator - Allows you to “and” and “or” clauses together.

Basic example:
--------------

.. code:: python

    @validates(inst(basestring), typ(int), between(0, 100))
    def do_something(name, id, age):
        pass

In the code above, a ``validoot.ValidationError`` will be thrown if the
``name`` is not a string or unicode, if the ``id`` is not an integer, or
if the ``age`` is not between 0 and 100.

Operators:
----------

We can extend the first example by adding an additional check for the
``name``: it must be between 5 and 40 characters. For this we use the
``validoot.And`` operator to combine the clauses.

.. code:: python

    @validates(And(inst(basestring), len_between(5, 40)), typ(int), between(0, 100))
    def do_something(name, id, age):
        pass

An ``Or`` operator also exists. Both ``And`` and ``Or`` take in a
variable number of clauses and can be nested further.

Operator shortcuts are provided for joining clauses in a different
manner which reads differently (``._and(...)``, ``._or(...)``). So our
previous example can be changed to look like this:

.. code:: python

    @validates(inst(basestring)._and(len_between(5, 40)), typ(int), between(0, 100))
    def do_something(name, id, age):
        pass

Keyword arguments:
------------------

There is also support for keyword arguments:

.. code:: python

    @validates(inst(basestring), something=typ(float))
    def do_something(name, something=1.0, anotherthing=2):
        pass

Here the ``something`` value must pass the validation checks as
specified in the decorator. No checks exist for ``anotherthing`` so it
has no restrictions.

Additional Clauses:
-------------------

There are some more complex clauses included with the package:

-  ``_`` : The underscore only allows ``NoneType``.
-  ``numeric`` : Only accepts ``int``, ``float``, or ``long`` types.
-  ``text`` : Only accepts instances of ``basestring`` (Python 2) or
   ``str`` (Python 3).

These can be found in the ``validoot.builtins`` module.

FAQ:
----

What if I don’t want validation for one of the position arguments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple. Just use ``None``.

.. code:: python

    @validates(inst(basestring), None, between(0, 100))
    def do_something(name, id, age):
        pass

What validation clauses are built in?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``typ(t)`` - value must be of exact type ``t``
-  ``inst(t)`` - value must be of exact type ``t`` or of subclass
-  ``between(lower, upper, lower_inc=True, upper_inc=False)`` - the
   value must between ``lower`` and ``upper``. ``lower_inc`` and ``upper_inc``
   indicate range inclusivity.
-  ``len_between(...)`` - identical to ``between`` but uses
   ``len(value)``
-  ``not_negative()`` - value cannot be negative

How do I create my own validation clauses?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The built in clauses provided by Validoot are all subclasses of the
``validoot.clauses.Clause`` object. Check out its source code to see
how they work. Technically clauses can be any callable object so plain
functions or lambdas also work.
