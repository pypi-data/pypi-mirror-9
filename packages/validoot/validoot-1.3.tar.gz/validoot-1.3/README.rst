validoot - 1.3
==============

This module is designed to solve the most basic of argument validations:
types, clauses, and combinations of clauses. It is meant to remove some
of the boiler plate code used to check the input types and checks such
as between, or string lengths.

Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Clause - A function that takes in the value as a parameter and
   returns ``True`` or ``False``.
-  Operator - Allows you to “and” and “or” clauses together.

Basic example:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    from validoot import validates, inst, typ, between

    @validates(inst(basestring), typ(int), between(0, 100))
    def do_something(name, id, age):
        pass

In the code above, a ``validoot.ValidationError`` will be thrown if the
``name`` is not a string or unicode, if the ``id`` is not an integer, or
if the ``age`` is not between 0 and 100.

.. code:: python

    >>> do_something('Darth Vader', 0, 42)
    >>> do_something('Boba Fett', 1, 123)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File "validoot/decorators.py", line 25, in __call__
        self.positional_validators[i], args[i], i))
    validoot.exceptions.ValidationError: Validation <in range [0..100)> failed for value 123 ( arg[2] )

Operators:
^^^^^^^^^^

We can extend the first example by adding an additional check for the
``name``: it must be between 5 and 40 characters. For this we use the
``validoot.And`` operator to combine the clauses.

.. code:: python

    from validoot import validates, inst, typ, between, len_between, And

    @validates(And(inst(basestring), len_between(5, 40)), typ(int), between(0, 100))
    def do_something(name, id, age):
        pass

An ``Or`` operator also exists. Both ``And`` and ``Or`` take in a
variable number of clauses and can be nested further.

Operator shortcuts are provided for joining clauses in a different
manner which reads differently (``._and(...)``, ``._or(...)``). So our
previous example can be changed to look like this:

.. code:: python

    from validoot import validates, inst, typ, between, len_between

    @validates(inst(basestring)._and(len_between(5, 40)), typ(int), between(0, 100))
    def do_something(name, id, age):
        pass

Operators can also be combined in more complicated ways:

.. code:: python

    inst(basestring)._and(len_between(5, 40))._or(typ(int))

Keyword arguments:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is also support for keyword arguments:

.. code:: python

    from validoot import validates, inst, typ

    @validates(inst(basestring), something=typ(float))
    def do_something(name, something=1.0, anotherthing=2):
        pass

Here the ``something`` value must pass the validation checks as
specified in the decorator. No checks exist for ``anotherthing`` so it
has no restrictions.

Decorating Class/Static/Instance methods or Constructors:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Methods belonging to classes can be validated as well in exactly the same way
as the examples above. Please make note of the order of the ``@validates``
decorator and other decorators such as ``@classmethod`` or ``@staticmethod``.

.. code:: python

    class SomeClass(object):

        # classmethod MUST be the innermost decorator!
        @validates(typ(int))
        @classmethod
        def some_class_method(cls, an_integer):
            return an_integer

        # staticmethod can be outer or inner decorator
        @staticmethod
        @validates(typ(float))
        def some_static_method(a_floater):
            return a_floater

        @validates(typ(string))
        def some_instance_method(self, a_string):
            return a_string

In order to validate arguments passed through to a constructor, the validates
decorator should be places on the class itself:

.. code:: python

    @validates(typ(string))
    class SomeClass(object):

        def __init__(self, username):
            self.username = username

Additional Clauses:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are some more complex clauses included with the package:

-  ``_`` : The underscore only allows ``NoneType``.
-  ``numeric`` : Only accepts ``int``, ``float``, or ``long`` types.
-  ``text`` : Only accepts instances of ``basestring`` (Python 2) or
   ``str`` (Python 3).
-  ``positive`` : Only positive numbers
-  ``negative`` : Only positive numbers
-  ``email_address`` : Simple regex email check (covers most basic examples)
-  ``ip_address`` : Only accept an IPv4 address
-  ``url`` : Simple regex url check (covers most basic examples)

These can be found in the ``validoot.builtins`` module.

FAQ:
^^^^

What if I don’t want validation for one of the position arguments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple. Just use ``None``.

.. code:: python

    from validoot import validates, inst, between

    @validates(inst(basestring), None, between(0, 100))
    def do_something(name, id, age):
        pass

What validation clauses are built in?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``typ(t)`` - value must be of exact type ``t``
-  ``inst(t)`` - value must be of exact type ``t`` or of a subclass
-  ``between(lower, upper, lower_inc=True, upper_inc=False)`` - the
   value must between ``lower`` and ``upper``. ``lower_inc`` and ``upper_inc``
   indicate range inclusivity.
-  ``len_between(...)`` - identical to ``between`` but uses
   ``len(value)``
-  ``regex(string)`` - value must match the regex string provided
-  ``list_of(v)`` - value must be a list of objects that pass the validation ``v``
-  ``dict_of(v1, v2)`` - value must be a dictionary where each key passes validation ``v1`` and each value passes validation ``v2``


How do I create my own validation clauses?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The built in clauses provided by Validoot are all subclasses of the
``validoot.clauses.Clause`` object. Check out its source code to see
how they work. Technically clauses can be any callable object so plain
functions or lambdas also work.
