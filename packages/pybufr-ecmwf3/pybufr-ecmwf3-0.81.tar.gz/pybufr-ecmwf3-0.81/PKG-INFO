Description: a python interface around the Fortran90 ECMWF-BUFR library
        constructed using the f2py interface generation tool.
        The equivalent subroutines to the ones in the ECMWF-BUFR
        library are made available to python, but also a set of wrapper
        routines/classes is implemented to
        create also a more object-oriented/pythonic interface.
        Building the interface is still a bit rough, and may require some
        editing of the setup.cfg file to choose the correct fortran and c-compiler.
        Alternatively some dedicated commandline options have been
        added to the setup.py script to allow changing these settings.
        Run 'setup.py build --help' to get a list of the currently available
        build options.
