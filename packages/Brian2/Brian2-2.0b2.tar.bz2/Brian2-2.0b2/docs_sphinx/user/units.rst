Physical units
==============

Brian includes a system for defining physical units. These are defined by
their standard SI unit names: amp,
kilogram, second, metre/meter and the derived units coulomb, farad, gram/gramme,
hertz, joule, pascal, ohm,  siemens, volt, watt, together with prefixed
versions (e.g. ``msiemens = 0.001*siemens``) using the prefixes
p, n, u, m, k, M, G, T (two exceptions: kilogram is not imported with any
prefixes, metre and meter are additionaly defined with the "centi" prefix,
i.e. cmetre/cmeter). In addition a couple of useful standard abbreviations like
"cm" (instead of cmetre/cmeter), "nS" (instead of nsiemens),
"ms" (instead of msecond), "Hz" (instead of hertz), etc. are included.


Using units
-----------
You can generate a physical quantity by multiplying a scalar or vector value
with its physical unit::

    >>> tau = 20*ms
    >>> print tau
    20. ms
    >>> rates = [10, 20, 30] * Hz
    >>> print rates
    [ 10.  20.  30.] Hz

Brian will check the consistency of operations on units and raise an error for
dimensionality mismatches::

    >>> tau += 1  # ms? second?  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    DimensionMismatchError: Addition, dimensions were (s) (1)
    >>> 3*gram + 3*amp   # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    DimensionMismatchError: Addition, dimensions were (kg) (A)

Most Brian functions will also complain about non-specified or incorrect units::

    >>> G = NeuronGroup(10, 'dv/dt = -v/tau: volt', dt=0.5)   # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    DimensionMismatchError: Function "__init__" variable "dt" has wrong dimensions, dimensions were (1) (s)

Numpy functions have been overwritten to correctly work with units (see the
:doc:`developer documentation <../developer/units>` for more details)::

    >>> print mean(rates)
    20. Hz
    >>> print rates.repeat(2)
    [ 10.  10.  20.  20.  30.  30.] Hz

Removing units
--------------
There are various options to remove the units from a value (e.g. to use it with
analysis functions that do not correctly work with units)

* Divide the value by its unit (most of the time the recommended option
  because it is clear about the scale)
* Transform it to a pure numpy array in the base unit by calling `asarray`
  (no copy) or `array` (copy)
* Directly get the unitless value of a state variable by appending an underscore
  to the name

::

    >>> tau/ms
    array(20.0)
    >> asarray(rates)
    array([ 10.,  20.,  30.])
    >>> G = NeuronGroup(5, 'dv/dt = -v/tau: volt')
    >>> print G.v_[:]
    [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]


Importing units
---------------
Brian generates standard names for units, combining the unit name (e.g.
"siemens") with a prefixes (e.g. "m"), and also generates squared and cubed
versions by appending a number. For example, the units "msiemens", "siemens2",
"usiemens3" are all predefined. You can import these units from the package
``brian2.units.allunits`` -- accordingly, an
``from brian2.units.allunits import *`` will result in everything from
``Ylumen3`` (cubed yotta lumen) to ``ymol`` (yocto mole) being imported.

A better choice is normally to do an ``from brian2.units import *`` or import
everything ``from brian2 import *``, this imports only the base units amp,
kilogram, second, metre/meter and the derived units coulomb, farad, gram/gramme,
hertz, joule, pascal, ohm,  siemens, volt, watt, together with the prefixes
p, n, u, m, k, M, G, T (two exceptions: kilogram is not imported with any
prefixes, metre and meter are additionaly defined with the "centi" prefix,
i.e. cmetre/cmeter).

In addition a couple of useful standard abbreviations like
"cm" (instead of cmetre/cmeter), "nS" (instead of nsiemens),
"ms" (instead of msecond), "Hz" (instead of hertz), etc. are added (they can
be individually imported from ``brian2.units.stdunits``).


Comparison with Brian 1
-----------------------

Brian 1 did only support scalar quantities, units were not stored for arrays.
Some expressions therefore have different values in Brian 1 and Brian 2:
