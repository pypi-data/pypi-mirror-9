Code generation
===============

The generation of a code snippet is done by a `CodeGenerator` class.
The templates are stored in the `CodeObject.templater` attribute, which is
typically implemented as a subdirectory of templates. The compilation and
running of code is done by a `CodeObject`. See the sections below for each
of these.

Code path
---------

The following gives an outline of the key steps that happen for the code
generation associated to a `NeuronGroup` `StateUpdater`. The items in grey
are Brian core functions and methods and do not need to be implemented to
create a new code generation target or device. The parts in yellow are
used when creating a new device. The parts in green relate to generating
code snippets from abstract code blocks. The parts in blue relate to creating
new templates which these snippets are inserted into. The parts in red
relate to creating new runtime behaviour (compiling and running generated
code).

In brief, what happens can be summarised as follows. `Network.run` will call
`BrianObject.before_run` on each of the objects in the network. Objects such
as `StateUpdater`, which is a subclass of `CodeRunner` use this spot to
generate and compile their code. The process for doing this is to first
create the abstract code block, done in the `StateUpdater.update_abstract_code`
method. Then, a `CodeObject` is created with this code block. In doing so,
Brian will call out to the currently active `Device` to get the `CodeObject`
and `CodeGenerator` classes associated to the device, and this hierarchy of
calls gives several hooks which can be changed to implement new targets.

Code generation
---------------

To implement a new language, or variant of an existing language, derive a class
from `CodeGenerator`. Good examples to look at are the `NumpyCodeGenerator`,
`CPPCodeGenerator` and `CythonCodeGenerator` classes in the 
``brian2.codegen.generators`` package. Each `CodeGenerator` has a ``class_name``
attribute which is a string used by the user to refer to this code generator
(for example, when defining function implementations).

The derived `CodeGenerator` class should implement the methods marked as
``NotImplemented`` in the base `CodeGenerator` class. `CodeGenerator` also has
several handy utility methods to make it easier to write these, see the
existing examples to get an idea of how these work.

Syntax translation
------------------

One aspect of writing a new language is that sometimes you need to translate
from Python syntax into the syntax of another language. You are free to
do this however you like, but we recommend using a `NodeRenderer` class
which allows you to iterate over the abstract syntax tree of an expression.
See examples in ``brian2.parsing.rendering``.

Templates
---------

In addition to snippet generation, you need to create templates for the
new language. See the ``templates`` directories in ``brian2.codegen.runtime.*``
for examples of these. They are written in the Jinja2 templating system. The
location of these templates is set as the `CodeObject.templater` attribute.
Examples such as `CPPCodeObject` show how this is done.

Code objects
------------

To allow the final code block to be compiled and run, derive a class from
`CodeObject`. This class should implement the placeholder methods defined in
the base class. The class should also have attributes ``templater`` (which
should be a `Templater` object pointing to the directory where the templates
are stored)
``generator_class`` (which should be the `CodeGenerator` class), and
``class_name`` (which should be a string the user can use to refer to this
code generation target.

Default functions
-----------------

You will typically want to implement the default functions such as the
trigonometric, exponential and ``rand`` functions. We usually put these
implementations either in the same module as the `CodeGenerator` class or
the `CodeObject` class depending on whether they are language-specific or
runtime target specific. See those modules for examples of implementing
these functions.
