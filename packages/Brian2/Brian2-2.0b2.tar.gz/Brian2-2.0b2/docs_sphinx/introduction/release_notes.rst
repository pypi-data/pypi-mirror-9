Release notes
=============

Brian 2.0b2
-----------
This is the second beta release for Brian 2.0, we recommend all users of Brian 2
to upgrade. If you are a user new to Brian, we also recommend to directly start
with Brian 2 instead of using the stable release of Brian 1.

This is however still a Beta release, please report bugs or suggestions to the
github bug tracker (https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/issues) or to the
brian-development mailing list (brian-development@googlegroups.com).

Major new features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Multi-compartmental simulations can now be run using the
  :ref:`cpp_standalone` mode (this is not yet well-tested, though).
* The implementation of `TimedArray` now supports two-dimensional arrays, i.e.
  different input per neuron (or synapse, etc.), see :ref:`timed_arrays` for
  details.
* Previously, not setting a code generation target (using the `codegen.target`
  preference) would mean that the ``numpy`` target was used. Now,
  the default target is ``auto``, which means that a compiled language
  (``weave`` or ``cython``) will be used if possible. See
  :doc:`../user/computation` for details.
* The implementation of `SpikeGeneratorGroup` has been improved and it now
  supports a ``period`` argument to repeatedly generate a spike pattern.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The selection of a numerical algorithm (if none has been specified by the
  user) has been simplified. See :ref:`numerical_integration` for details.
* Expressions that are shared among neurons/synapses are now updated only once
  instead of for every neuron/synapse which can lead to performance
  improvements.
* On Windows, The Microsoft Visual C compiler is now supported in the
  ``cpp_standalone`` mode, see the respective notes in the :doc:`install` and
  :doc:`../user/computation` documents.
* Simulation runs (using the standard "runtime" device) now collect profiling
  information. See :ref:`profiling` for details.

Infrastructure and documentation improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* :doc:`Tutorials for beginners <../resources/tutorials/index>` in the form of
  ipython notebooks (currently only covering the basics of neurons and synapses)
  are now available.
* The :doc:`../examples/index` in the documentation now include the images
  they generated. Several examples have been adapted from Brian 1.
* The code is now automatically tested on Windows machines, using the
  `appveyor <http://ci.appveyor.com>`_ service. This complements the Linux
  testing on `travis <https://travis-ci.org>`_.
* Using a version of a dependency (e.g. sympy) that we don't support will now
  raise an error when you import ``brian2`` -- see :ref:`dependency_checks` for
  more details.
* Test coverage for the ``cpp_standalone`` mode has been significantly
  increased.

Important bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The preparation time for complicated equations has been significantly reduced.
* The string representation of small physical quantities has been corrected
  (#361)
* Linking variables from a group of size 1 now works correctly (#383)

Brian 2.0beta
-------------
This is the first beta release for Brian 2.0 and the first version of Brian 2.0
we recommend for general use. From now on, we will try to keep changes that
break existing code to a minimum. If you are a user new to Brian, we'd
recommend to start with the Brian 2 beta instead of using the stable release of
Brian 1.

This is however still a Beta release, please report bugs or suggestions to the
github bug tracker (https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/issues) or to the
brian-development mailing list (brian-development@googlegroups.com).

Major new features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* New classes `Morphology` and `SpatialNeuron` for the simulation of
  :doc:`../user/multicompartmental`
* A temporary "bridge" for ``brian.hears`` that allows to use its Brian 1
  version from Brian 2 (:doc:`../user/brian1hears_bridge`)
* Cython is now a new code generation target, therefore the performance benefits
  of compiled code are now also available to users running simulations under
  Python 3.x (where ``scipy.weave`` is not available)
* Networks can now store their current state and return to it at a later time,
  e.g. for simulating multiple trials starting from a fixed network state
  (:ref:`continue_repeat`)
* C++ standalone mode: multiple processors are now supported via OpenMP
  (:ref:`openmp`), although this code has not yet been well tested so may be
  inaccurate.
* C++ standalone mode: after a run, state variables and monitored values can
  be loaded from disk transparently. Most scripts therefore only need two
  additional lines to use standalone mode instead of Brian's default runtime
  mode (:ref:`cpp_standalone`).

Syntax changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The syntax and semantics of everything around simulation time steps, clocks,
  and multiple runs have been cleaned up, making ``reinit`` obsolete and also
  making it unnecessary for most users to explicitly generate `Clock` objects --
  instead, a ``dt`` keyword can be specified for objects such as `NeuronGroup`
  (:doc:`../user/running`)
* The ``scalar`` flag for parameters/subexpressions has been renamed to
  ``shared``
* The "unit" for boolean variables has been renamed from ``bool`` to ``boolean``
* C++ standalone: several keywords of
  `CPPStandaloneDevice.build <brian2.devices.cpp_standalone.device.CPPStandaloneDevice.build>`
  have been renamed
* The preferences are now accessible via ``prefs`` instead of ``brian_prefs``
* The ``runner`` method has been renamed to `~brian2.groups.group.Group.custom_operation`

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Variables can now be linked across `NeuronGroup`\ s (:ref:`linked_variables`)
* More flexible progress reporting system, progress reporting also works in the
  C++ standalone mode (:ref:`progress_reporting`)
* State variables can be declared as ``integer`` (:ref:`equation_strings`)

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
57 github issues have been closed since the alpha release, of which 26 had been
labeled as bugs. We recommend all users of Brian 2 to upgrade.
