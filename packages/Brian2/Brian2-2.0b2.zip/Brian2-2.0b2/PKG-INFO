Description: 
        Brian2 is a simulator for spiking neural networks available on almost all platforms.
        The motivation for this project is that a simulator should not only save the time of
        processors, but also the time of scientists.
        
        It is the successor of Brian1 and shares its approach of being highly flexible
        and easily extensible. It is based on a code generation framework that allows
        to execute simulations using other programming languages and/or on different
        devices.
        
        We currently consider this software to be in the beta status, please report
        issues to the github issue tracker (https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/issues) or to the
        brian-development mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/brian-development/)
