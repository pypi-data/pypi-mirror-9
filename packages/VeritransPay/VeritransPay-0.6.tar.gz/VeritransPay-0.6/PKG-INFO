Description: 
        VeritransPay
        -------
        
        Client library for communicating with **VERSION 2** of the
        veritrans.co.id payment gateway.  Note, there is no support for the older
        v1 API as this was dropped in Dec 2014.
        
        Notes
        `````
        This is still an early release and does not provide access to all the
        functionality of the Veritrans.co.id API.  Currently, only submitting
        credit-card payments, and receiving that response is supported.
