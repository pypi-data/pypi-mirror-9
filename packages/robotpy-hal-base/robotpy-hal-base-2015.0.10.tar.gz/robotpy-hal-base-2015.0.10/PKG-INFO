Description: RobotPy Abstraction Layer (HAL) for WPILib
        ==========================================
        
        Python wrappers around the HAL used by WPILib. This package is not useful by
        itself, but requires a HAL implementation to also be installed.
        
        HAL Implementations
        ===================
        
        * robotpy-hal-roborio: interacts with the hardware on the RoboRIO
        * robotpy-hal-sim: designed for simulation and testing purposes
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Typically, you don't install this directly, but use the RobotPy installer
        to install it on your RoboRIO, or it is installed by pip as part of the
        pyfrc setup process.
