Purpose
=======

This module provides common functions to add one configuration block
to another (:func:`overlay_config`), and to do the reverse
(:func:`diff_config`).

    This overlays `c1` on top of `c0` as follows:

    * Any key in `c0` not present in `c1` is present in the result with
      its original value.
    * Any key in `c1` with value :const:`None` is not present in the result.
    * Any key in `c1` not present in `c0` and not :const:`None` is present in
      the result with its new value.
    * Any key in both `c1` and `c0` with a non-:const:`None` value is

    This finds a delta configuration from `c0` to `c1`, such that

    * If both are identical (of any type), returns an empty dictionary.

    * Any key in `c1` not present in `c0` is included in the output

      with value :const:`None`.
