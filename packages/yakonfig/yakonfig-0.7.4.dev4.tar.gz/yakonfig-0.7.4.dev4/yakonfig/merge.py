This module provides common functions to add one configuration block
to another (:func:`overlay_config`), and to do the reverse
(:func:`diff_config`).

    This overlays `overlay` on top of `base` as follows:

    * If either isn't a dictionary, returns `overlay`.
    * Any key in `base` not present in `overlay` is present in the
      result with its original value.
    * Any key in `overlay` with value :const:`None` is not present in
      the result, unless it also is :const:`None` in `base`.
    * Any key in `overlay` not present in `base` and not :const:`None`
      is present in the result with its new value.
    * Any key in both `overlay` and `base` with a non-:const:`None` value
      is recursively overlaid.

    This finds a delta configuration from `base` to `target`, such that
    calling :func:`overlay_config` with `base` and the result of this
    function yields `target`.  This works as follows:

    * If both are identical (of any type), returns an empty dictionary.
    * If either isn't a dictionary, returns `target`.
    * Any key in `target` not present in `base` is included in the output
      with its value from `target`.
    * Any key in `base` not present in `target` is included in the output
      with value :const:`None`.
    * Any keys present in both dictionaries are recursively merged.
