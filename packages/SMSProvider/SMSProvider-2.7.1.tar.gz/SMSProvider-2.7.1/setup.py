    long_description="""LinOTP is an open solution for strong two-factor authentication with One Time Passwords.
        LinOTP 2 is also open as far as its modular architecture is concerned.
        LinOTP 2 aims to not bind you to any  decision of the authentication protocol or
        it does not dictate you where your user information should be stored.
        This is achieved by its new, totally modular architecture.

        This package contains the LinOTP SMSProvider.""",
