Description: Orange Bioinformatics
        =====================
        
        Orange Bioinformatics extends Orange_, a data mining software
        package, with common functionality for bioinformatics. The provided
        functionality can be accessed as a Python library or through a visual
        programming interface (Orange Canvas). The latter is also suitable for
        non-programmers.
        
        In Orange Canvas the analyst connects basic computational units, called
        widgets, into data flow analytics schemas. Two units-widgets can be
        connected if they share a data type. Compared to other popular tools like
        Taverna, Orange widgets are high-level, integrated potentially complex
        tasks, but are specific enough to be used independently. Even elaborate
        analyses rarely consist of more than ten widgets; while tasks such as
        clustering and enrichment analysis could be executed with up to five
        widgets. While building the schema each widget is independently controlled
        with settings, the settings do not conceptually burden the analyst.
        
        Orange Bioinformatics provides access to publicly available data,
        like GEO data sets, Biomart, GO, KEGG, Atlas, ArrayExpress, and PIPAx
        database. As for the analytics, there is gene selection, quality control,
        scoring distances between experiments with multiple factors. All features
        can be combined with powerful visualization, network exploration and
        data mining techniques from the Orange data mining framework.
