Features
^^^^^^^^

- Polls can be opened for anonymous users to vote
- If an open poll is allowed for anonymous but is inside a private folder,
  nobody can vote. Therefore the poll's parent folder needs to be published
  before opening the poll in order for this field to take effect
- Voting can take place either in the object or in a voting portlet;
- The voting portlet can show the latest open poll or ab specific open poll
  and closed polls
- Users can see partial results of the poll
- Results can be shown using a bar chart, a pie chart, or just by number of
  votes
- Polls can have relations with other content in the site

Workflow description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The workflow associated with polls has the following states: 'Private',
'Pending review', 'Open' and 'Closed'.

- Polls are created in 'Private' state; only Owner, Manager, Editor or Site
  Administrator roles can modify them.

- When a poll is in 'Private' state it can be sent to 'Pending review' or
  directly to 'Open' state, if the user has the proper role (Reviewer, Manager
  or Site Administrator).

- When a poll is in 'Pending review' state it can be edited by Manager,
  Editor, Reviewer or Site Administrator roles.

- A poll in 'Pending review' state can be sent to 'Open' state, with "Review
  portal content" permission, or to Private, with "Request review" permission.

- When the poll is 'Open' users can only vote; nobody can modify the poll in
  any way.

- An 'Open' poll can be sent to 'Private' or 'Closed' state by Reviewer,
  Manager or Site Administrator roles.

- When an 'Open' poll is sent to 'Private', all votes are removed to avoid
  data manipulation.

- When a poll is in 'Closed' state nobody can modify it, nor can anyone vote
  on it; a closed poll can always be reopened by usera with proper
  permissions.

Not entirely unlike
-------------------

`Plone PoPoll`_
    A very old an unmaintained product, PoPoll includes a poll tool that
    allows member or anonymous to vote for one or more answers. A portlet is
    provided. It can be configured to display the last poll, or the first poll
    of a folder. After the vote statistics screens are shown.
