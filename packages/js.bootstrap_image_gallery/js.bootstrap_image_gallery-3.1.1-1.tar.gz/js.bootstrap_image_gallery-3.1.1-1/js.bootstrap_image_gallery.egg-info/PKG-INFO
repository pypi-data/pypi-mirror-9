        ==========================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `Bootstrap Image Gallery`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Bootstrap Image Gallery`: http://blueimp.github.com/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.bootstrap_image_gallery``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import ``gallery`` from ``js.bootstrap_image_gallery`` and ``need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.bootstrap_image_gallery import gallery
          >>> gallery.need()
        
        If you only want the JS resources::
        
          >>> from js.bootstrap_image_gallery import gallery_js
          >>> gallery_js.need()
        
        If you only want the CSS resources::
        
          >>> from js.bootstrap_image_gallery import gallery_css
          >>> gallery_css.need()
