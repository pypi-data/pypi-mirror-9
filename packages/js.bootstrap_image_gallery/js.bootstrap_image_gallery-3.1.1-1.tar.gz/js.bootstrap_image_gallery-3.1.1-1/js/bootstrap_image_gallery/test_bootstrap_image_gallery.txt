How to use?
===========

You can import ``gallery`` from ``js.bootstrap_image_gallery`` and ``need`` it
where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.bootstrap_image_gallery import gallery
  >>> gallery.need()

If you only want the JS resources::

  >>> from js.bootstrap_image_gallery import gallery_js
  >>> gallery_js.need()

If you only want the CSS resources::

  >>> from js.bootstrap_image_gallery import gallery_css
  >>> gallery_css.need()
