Description: 
        gcs-oauth2-boto-plugin is a Python application whose purpose is to behave as an
        auth plugin for the boto auth plugin framework for use with OAuth 2.0
        credentials for the Google Cloud Platform. This plugin is compatible with both
        user accounts and service accounts, and its functionality is essentially a
        wrapper around the oauth2client package of google-api-python-client with the
        addition of automatically caching tokens for the machine in a thread- and
        process-safe fashion.
