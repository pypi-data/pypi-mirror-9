       NMEA-0183

       Under the NMEA-0183 standard, all characters used are printable
       ASCII text (plus carriage return and line feed).  NMEA-0183 data
       is sent at 4800 baud.

       The data is transmitted in the form of "sentences".  Each
       sentence starts with a "$", a two letter "talker ID", a three
       letter "sentence ID", followed by a number of data fields
       separated by commas, and terminated by an optional checksum, and
       a carriage return/line feed.  A sentence may contain up to 82
       characters including the "$" and CR/LF.

       If data for a field is not available, the field is simply
       omitted, but the commas that would delimit it are still sent,
       with no space between them.

       Since some fields are variable width, or may be omitted as
       above, the receiver should locate desired data fields by
       counting commas, rather than by character position within the
       sentence.

       The optional checksum field consists of a "*" and two hex digits
       representing the exclusive OR of all characters between, but not
       including, the "$" and "*".  A checksum is required on some
       sentences.

       The standard allows individual manufacturers to define
       proprietary sentence formats.  These sentences start with "$P",
       then a 3 letter manufacturer ID, followed by whatever data the
       manufacturer wishes, following the general format of the
       standard sentences.

       Some common talker IDs are:
              GP      Global Positioning System receiver
              LC      Loran-C receiver
              OM      Omega Navigation receiver
              II      Integrated Instrumentation
                              (eg. AutoHelm Seatalk system)
