Upgrade from 0.5 to 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On upgrade to version 0.6 you should run :samp:`./manage.py syncdb` and
:samp:`./manage.py setupgroups --move` to setup access control as described
in installation section.

Upgrade from 0.6 to 0.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On upgrade to version 0.7 you should run :samp:`./manage.py syncdb` to

:samp:`./manage.py rebuild_index` to rebuild index for fulltext search.

Upgrade from 0.8 to 0.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On upgrade to version 0.9 file structure has changed. You need to move
:file:`repos` and :file:`whoosh-index` to :file:`weblate` folder. Also running
:samp:`./manage.py syncdb`, :samp:`./manage.py setupgroups` and
:samp:`./manage.py setuplang` is recommended to get latest updates of 
privileges and language definitions.

Upgrade from 0.9 to 1.0

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate trans 0001 --fake
    ./manage.py migrate accounts 0001 --fake
    ./manage.py migrate lang 0001 --fake

Also please note that there are several new requirements and version 0.8 of

* Checks were moved to submodules.
* Locales were moved to top level directory.

The migration of database structure to 1.5 might take quite long, it is
recommended to put your site offline, while the migration is going on.


.. note::

    If you have update in same directory, stale :file:`*.pyc` files might be
    left around and cause various import errors. To recover from this, delete
    all of them in Weblate's directory, for example by 
    ``find . -name '*.pyc' -delete``.

Upgrade from 1.6 to 1.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The migration of database structure to 1.7 might take quite long, it is

(see `Upgrading PSA with South`_ for more information):

Upgrade from 2.0 to 2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The filesystem paths configuration has changed, the :setting:`GIT_ROOT` and
:setting:`WHOOSH_INDEX` are gone and now all data resides in
:setting:`DATA_DIR`. The existing data should be automatically migrated by
supplied migration, but in case of non standard setup, you might need to move
these manually.

    :ref:`django-17`.

Upgrade from 2.1 to 2.2

Weblate now supports fulltext search on additional fields. In order to make it
work on existing data you need to udpate fulltext index by:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py rebuild_index --clean --all

If you have some monolingual translations, Weblate now allows to edit template
(source) strings as well. To see them, you need to reload translations, what
will either happen automatically on next repository update or you can force it
manually:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py loadpo --all

.. seealso::

    If you are upgrading to Django 1.7 in same step, please consult
    :ref:`django-17`.


.. _django-17:

Upgrading to Django 1.7
-----------------------

Please  adjust your :file:`settings.py` to match several changes in the
configuration (consult :file:`settings_example.py` for correct values).

Django 1.7 has a new feature to handle database schema upgrade called
"migrations" which is incompatible with South (used before by Weblate).

Before migrating to Django 1.7, you first need to apply all migrations from
South. If you already have upgraded Django to 1.7, you can do this using
virtualenv and :file:`examples/migrate-south` script:

.. code-block:: sh

    examples/migrate-south --settings weblate.settings

Once you have done that, you can run Django 1.7 migrations and work as usual.

.. _pootle-migration:

Migrating from Pootle
---------------------

As Weblate was originally written as replacement from Pootle, it is supported
to migrate user accounts from Pootle. All you need to do is to copy
``auth_user`` table from Pootle, user profiles will be automatically created
for users as they log in and they will be asked to update their settings.
Alternatively you can use :djadmin:`importusers` to import dumped user
credentials.
