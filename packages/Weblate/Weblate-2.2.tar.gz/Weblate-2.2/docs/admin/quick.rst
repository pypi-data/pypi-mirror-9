Quick setup guide
=================

.. note::

    This is just a quick guide for installing and starting to use Weblate for
    testing purposes. Please check :ref:`install` for more real world setup
    instructions.

Installing from sources
-----------------------

#. Install all required dependencies, see :ref:`requirements`.

#. Grab Weblate sources (either using Git or download a tarball) and unpack
   them.

#. Copy :file:`weblate/settings_example.py` to :file:`weblate/settings.py` and
   adjust it to match your setup. You will at least need to configure database
   connection (possibly adding user and creating the database). Check
   :ref:`config` for Weblate specific configuration options.

#. Create database which will be used by Weblate, :ref:`database-setup`.

#. Build Django tables and initial data:

   .. code-block:: sh

        ./manage.py syncdb
        ./manage.py migrate
        ./scripts/generate-locales # If you are using Git checkout

#. Configure webserver to serve Weblate, see :ref:`server`.


Using prebuilt appliance
------------------------

#. Download the appliance and start it. You need to choose format depending on
   your target environment.

#. Everything should be set up immediately after boot, though you will want
   to adjust some settings to improve security, see :ref:`appliance`.

Installing on OpenShift
-----------------------

#. You can install Weblate on OpenShift PaaS directly from its git repository using the OpenShift Client Tools:

   .. parsed-literal::

        rhc -aweblate app create -t python-2.7 --from-code \https://github.com/nijel/weblate.git#weblate-|version| --no-git

#. After installation everything should be preconfigured and you can immediately start to add a translation
   project as described below. For more information, including on how to retrieve the generated admin password, see :ref:`openshift`.

Adding translation
------------------

#. Open admin interface (http://localhost/admin/) and create project you
   want to translate. See :ref:`project` for more details.

   All you need to specify here is project name and it's website.

#. Create component which is the real object for translating - it points to
   VCS repository and selects which files to translate. See :ref:`component`
   for more details.

   The important fields here being component name, VCS repository address and
   mask for finding translatable files. Weblate supports wide range of formats
   including Gettext PO files, Android resource strings, OS X string properties,
   Java properties or Qt Linguist files, see :ref:`formats` for more details.


#. Once above is completed (it can be lengthy process depending on size of
   your VCS repository and number of messages to translate), you can start
   translating.
