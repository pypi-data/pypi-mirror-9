Machine translation setup
-------------------------

Weblate has builtin support for several machine translation services and it's
up to administrator to enable them. The services have different terms of use, so
please check whether you are allowed to use them before enabling in Weblate.
The individual services are enabled using :setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES`.

The source langauge can be configured by :setting:`SOURCE_LANGUAGE` and is
shared for all translations within Weblate.

Amagama

.. _tmserver:

tmserver
++++++++

You can run your own translation memory server which is bundled with
Translate-toolkit and let Weblate talk to it. You can also use it with 
amaGama server, which is enhanced version of tmserver.

First you will want to import some data to the translation memory:

To enable this service, add ``trans.machine.tmserver.TMServerTranslation`` to
:setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES`.

.. code-block:: sh

    build_tmdb -d /var/lib/tm/db -s en -t cs locale/cs/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    build_tmdb -d /var/lib/tm/db -s en -t de locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    build_tmdb -d /var/lib/tm/db -s en -t fr locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/django.po

Now you can start tmserver to listen to your requests:

.. code-block:: sh

    tmserver -d /var/lib/tm/db

And configure Weblate to talk to it:

.. code-block:: python

    MT_TMSERVER = 'http://localhost:8888/'

.. seealso::

    :setting:`MT_TMSERVER`, 
    http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/latest/commands/tmserver.html, 
    http://amagama.translatehouse.org/

Weblate
+++++++

Weblate can be source of machine translation as well. There are two services to
provide you results - one does exact search for string, the other one finds all
similar strings.

First one is useful for full string translations, the second one for finding
individual phrases or words to keep the translation consistent.

To enable these services, add
``trans.machine.weblatetm.WeblateSimilarTranslation`` (for similar string
matching) and/or ``trans.machine.weblatetm.WeblateTranslation`` (for exact
string matching) to :setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES`.

.. note:: 

    For similarity matching, it is recommended to have Whoosh 2.5.2 or later,
    earlier versions can cause infinite looks under some occasions.

Custom machine translation
--------------------------

You can also implement own machine translation services using few lines of
Python code. Following example implements translation to fixed list of
languages using ``dictionary`` Python module:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mt_service.py
    :language: python

You can list own class in :setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES` and Weblate
will start using that.
