# XRUTILS user configuration 
# default values for some properties of xrayutilities may be set
# the syntax follows the one of the ConfigParser python module,
# which is similar to .ini files

# if you want to use this user-specific config file you need to place it in 
#    ~/.xrayutilities.conf 
# or the local directory 
#    ./xrayutilities.conf 

# The config file with the default parameters is found in the python installation 
# path of xrayutilities. It is however not recommended to change things there, 
# instead the user-specific config file

# begin of xrayutilities configuration
