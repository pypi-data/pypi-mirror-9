0.2 (2015-03-13)
================

- Change ``find_service(..., context=None)`` to use a context of ``None``.
  Previously this would fallback to using ``request.context`` if the
  ``context`` was ``None``. Now ``find_service`` will only fallback to
  ``request.context`` when no ``context`` argument is specified.

- Support ``introspectable`` for services so that they show up in the
  pyramid_debugtoolbar and elsewhere.
  See https://github.com/mmerickel/pyramid_services/pull/2

0.1.1 (2015-02-17)

- Support for ``request.find_service``, ``config.register_service``, and
  ``config.register_service_factory``.
- Initial commits.
