Overview
--------
SIMA (Sequential IMage Analysis) is an Open Source package for 
analysis of time-series imaging data arising from fluorescence
microscopy.  The functionality of this package includes:

- correction of motion artifacts
- segmentation of imaging fields into regions of interest (ROIs)
- extraction of dynamic signals from ROIs

The included ROI Buddy software provides a graphical user interface
(GUI) supporting the following functionality:

- manual creation of ROIs
- editing of ROIs resulting from automated segmentation
- registration of ROIs across separate imaging sessions
