Add T-Series,Adds a .sima directory to the list of imaging datasetsAuto add t-series,"Recursively walk the selected directory and add directories ending in .sima.  Optionally a *tag* argument can be specified, in which case *tag* must be contained in the .sima directory name"Save current ROIs,Save the active ROIList associated with the active imaging datasetSave all ROIs,"For each loaded imaging dataset, save the active ROIList with the same name"Edit Label,Edit the ``label`` property associated with the selected ROI objects.  If two polygons in the active ROI List share the same ``label`` they are assumed to be disjoint regions comprising a single ROI object.Add Tags,"Add comma-delimited strings to the ROI ``tags`` property.  This feature is useful for tagging ROIs on morphology, genetic identity, etc. and filtering based on this criteria in subsequent analysis "Remove Tags,Clear the ``tags`` associated with the selected ROIsEdit Tags,Manually edit the list of comma-delimited ``tag`` strings associated with the selected ROIsMerge," - *Edit Mode*: If the selected polygons are contiguous, merge them into a single polygon defined by the convex hull containing the selected polygons.  If regions are discontiguous, assign them a common ``label`` property, indicating that these disjoint structures comprise a single ROI upon saving."," - *Align Mode*: Select exactly two polygons from different imaging datasets.  The selected regions will be assigned the same ``id`` property, indicating that they are the same structure imaged during different sessions.  The ``id`` assigned corresponds  to that of the ROI belonging to the largest cluster."Unmerge,"Unmerge the selected ROI from any groupings.  In both *Edit* and *Align* modes, the ``id`` property is cleared.  In *Edit* mode, the ``label`` property is set to a unique value."Quit,Quit ROI Buddy application
