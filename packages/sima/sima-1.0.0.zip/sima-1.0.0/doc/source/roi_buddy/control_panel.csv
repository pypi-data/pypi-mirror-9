 - Edit Mode,"Toggling to edit mode allows for editing, creation, and deletion of ROIs.  In addition, this is the mode in which ROI tagging and labeling takes place." - Align Mode,"Toggling to align mode allows for the transformation of ROI Lists from separate imaging sessions into a common space, allowing for simultaneous visualization of independently drawn sets.  In this view, ROI objects can be deleted (as in the case of singleton ROIs that were perhaps a false positive), and ROIs can be registered across days."Remove / Add,Add or remove SImA datasets from the dataset list.ROI Set,"A dropdown allowing for selection of the ROI List currently being modified.  Only this ROI List is modified.  These ROI Lists correspond to the keys of imagingDataset.ROIs().  By default, the most recently modified ROI List is displayed upon initialization."New / Delete Set,Create or delete ROI Lists for the active SImA imaging dataset.  These lists are stored in the associated imagingDatset.ROIs dictionary.Register ROIs,"In align mode, the register ROIs feature allows for the assignment of a common ``id`` property to overlapping ROI objects.  A clustering algorithm based on the Jaccard Index is used for tracking ROIs across imaging sessions.  Results can be manually edited using the *merge* and *unmerge* tools."Propagate Tags,"In align mode, the propagate tags button distributes tags across ROI objects from different imaging datasets sharing the same ``id`` property.  The user can select which tags to propagate.  Thus, regions need only be tagged in one imaging_dataset, and these tags can be added to other recordings of the same region."Show ROIs / All,"Toggle the visibility of ROI polygons.  In align mode, Show All results in the transformation of all ROIs into a common space, allowing for visual inspection of alignment across imaging sessions."
