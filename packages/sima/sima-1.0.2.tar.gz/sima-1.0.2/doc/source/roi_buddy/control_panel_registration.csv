Register ROIs,"Begin automatic registration using the currently active dataset as the registration template.
If datasets do not match, an error dialog will identify the datasets that could be aligned."
Propagate Tags,"In align mode, the propagate tags button distributes tags across ROI objects from different imaging datasets sharing the same ``id`` property.  The user can select which tags to propagate.  Thus, regions need only be tagged in one dataset, and these tags can be added to other recordings of the same region."
