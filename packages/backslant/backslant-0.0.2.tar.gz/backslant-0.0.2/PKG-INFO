Description: Backslant
        =========
        
        Is a template engine built in completely other way then before.
        
        First - you can use all python and more - you must use it if you want somwthing more
        then just tags.
        
        Second - it completely iterative. You can feed iterators or generators as input and get iterative output.
        
        Third - it works through imports. If you want to get template just import it and use. If you want include
        other template - import it. If you want template in some dir, import it! Like ```from . import other_template```.
        
        So, with this principles in mind, you can try this proof of concept thing, due it is not complete:
        
            import backslant
        
            sys.meta_path.insert(0, backslant.PymlFinder('./templates', hook='backslant_import'))
            from backslant_import.home import index
        
            for chunk in index.render():
                print(chunk)
        
        
        I will complete feture set soon, stay tuned. Pssst, we will have ruby-like blocks, dont tell anyone.
