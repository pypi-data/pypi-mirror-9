Here are localization files.

Translation files are located at djangofloor/locale/language_code/LC_MESSAGES/django.po

There are several steps to follow to get valid translation strings:
    - Create translation files by running django-admin.py makemessages -l fr_FR -d django
        **from the djangofloor folder**.
    - Create translation files for JavaScript by running django-admin.py makemessages -l fr_FR -d djangojs
        **from the djangofloor folder**.
    - Manually translate these files
    - Compile messages by running django-admin.py compilemessages
        **from the djangofloor folder**.
