Widget description
==================

This is a container widget that takes a standard Edje design file and
wraps it very thinly in a widget.

An Edje design (theme) file has a very wide range of possibilities to
describe the behavior of elements added to the Layout. Check out the Edje
documentation and the EDC reference to get more information about what can
be done with Edje.

Just like :py:class:`~efl.elementary.list.List`,
:py:class:`~efl.elementary.box.Box`, and other container
widgets, any object added to the Layout will become its child, meaning
that it will be deleted if the Layout is deleted, move if the Layout is
moved, and so on.

The Layout widget can contain as many Contents, Boxes or Tables as
described in its theme file. For instance, objects can be added to
different Tables by specifying the respective Table part names. The same
is valid for Content and Box.

The objects added as child of the Layout will behave as described in the
part description where they were added. There are 3 possible types of
parts where a child can be added:

Content (SWALLOW part)

    Only one object can be added to the ``SWALLOW`` part (but you still can
    have many ``SWALLOW`` parts and one object on each of them). Use the
    ``Object.content_set/get/unset`` functions to set, retrieve and unset
    objects as content of the *SWALLOW*. After being set to this part,
    the object size, position, visibility, clipping and other description
    properties will be totally controlled by the description of the
    given part (inside the Edje theme file).

    One can use ``size_hint_`` functions on the child to have some kind of
    control over its behavior, but the resulting behavior will still
    depend heavily on the ``SWALLOW`` part description.

    The Edje theme also can change the part description, based on
    signals or scripts running inside the theme. This change can also be
    animated. All of this will affect the child object set as content
    accordingly. The object size will be changed if the part size is
    changed, it will animate move if the part is moving, and so on.

Box (BOX part)

    An Edje ``BOX`` part is very similar to the Elementary
    :py:class:`~efl.elementary.box.Box` widget. It allows one to add objects to
    the box and have them distributed along its area, accordingly to the
    specified ``layout`` property (now by ``layout`` we mean the chosen
    layouting design of the Box, not the Layout widget itself).

    A similar effect for having a box with its position, size and other things
    controlled by the Layout theme would be to create an Elementary
    :py:class:`~efl.elementary.box.Box` widget and add it as a Content in the
    ``SWALLOW`` part.

    The main difference of using the Layout Box is that its behavior, the box
    properties like layouting format, padding, align, etc. will be all
    controlled by the theme. This means, for example, that a signal could be
    sent to the Layout theme (with
    :py:meth:`~efl.elementary.object.Object.signal_emit`) and the theme handled
    the signal by changing the box padding, or align, or both. Using the
    Elementary :py:class:`~efl.elementary.box.Box` widget is not necessarily
    harder or easier, it just depends on the circumstances and requirements.

    The Layout Box can be used through the ``box_`` set of functions.

Table (TABLE part)

    Just like the *Box*, the Layout Table is very similar to the Elementary
    :py:class:`~efl.elementary.table.Table` widget. It allows one to add objects
    to the Table specifying the row and column where the object should be added,
    and any column or row span if necessary.

    Again, we could have this design by adding a
    :py:class:`~efl.elementary.table.Table` widget to the ``SWALLOW`` part using
    :py:func:`~efl.elementary.object.Object.part_content_set`. The same
    difference happens here when choosing to use the Layout Table (a ``TABLE``
    part) instead of the :py:class:`~efl.elementary.table.Table` plus
    ``SWALLOW`` part. It's just a matter of convenience.

    The Layout Table can be used through the ``table_`` set of functions.

Another interesting thing about the Layout widget is that it offers some
predefined themes that come with the default Elementary theme. These themes can
be set by :py:attr:`~efl.elementary.layout_class.LayoutClass.theme`, and provide
some basic functionality depending on the theme used.

Most of them already send some signals, some already provide a toolbar or
back and next buttons.


Available styles
================

These are available predefined theme layouts. All of them have class =
*layout*, group = *application*, and style = one of the following options:

- ``toolbar-content`` - application with toolbar and main content area
- ``toolbar-content-back`` - application with toolbar and main content
  area with a back button and title area
- ``toolbar-content-back-next`` - application with toolbar and main
  content area with a back and next buttons and title area
- ``content-back`` - application with a main content area with a back
  button and title area
- ``content-back-next`` - application with a main content area with a
  back and next buttons and title area
- ``toolbar-vbox`` - application with toolbar and main content area as a
  vertical box
- ``toolbar-table`` - application with toolbar and main content area as a
  table


Emitted signals
===============

- ``theme,changed`` - The theme was changed.
- ``language,changed`` - the program's language changed
