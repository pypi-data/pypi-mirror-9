The core ideas used in this Moserware.Skills for Python project were described in 
"TrueSkill (TM): A Bayesian Skill Rating System" available at 
http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=67956

The authors of the above paper have asked for a link to that article
as attribution in derived works.

Some concepts were based on sample F# code that was written by Ralf Herbrich
