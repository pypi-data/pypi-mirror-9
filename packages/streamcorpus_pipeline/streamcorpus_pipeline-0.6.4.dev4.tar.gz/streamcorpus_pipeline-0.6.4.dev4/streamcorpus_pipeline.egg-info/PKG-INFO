Description: StreamCorpus Pipeline
        =====================
        
        streamcorpus_pipeline is a document processing pipeline that assembles
        streamcorpus objects from raw data sets.
        
        The streamcorpus_pipeline python module contains tools for processing
        streamcorpus.StreamItem objects stored in Chunks.  It includes
        transform functions for getting clean_html, clean_visible, creating
        labels from hyperlinks to particular sites (e.g. Wikipedia), and
        taggers like LingPipe, Serif, and Factorie, which make Tokens and
        Sentences.
