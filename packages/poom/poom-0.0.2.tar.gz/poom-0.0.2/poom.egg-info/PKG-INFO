Description: This is primarily a Dropbox app and acts as a Dropbox client. The app doesn't have any permission over your existing Dropbox files. So when you open a document with the app it first uploads the file to its own directory on your Dropbox and then opens the file from there using the Microsoft Office online edition. The app supports both way syncing.Once you've edited the file in Dropbox the changes are going to be temporarily saved there. The next time you open the same file using this app it will show you the last modified version of the file, meaning if the file was last modified on Dropbox it will open the Dropbox version and sync your local file and vice versa.
