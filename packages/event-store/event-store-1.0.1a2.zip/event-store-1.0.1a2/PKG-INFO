Description: Event Store
        ===========
        
        Event Store is an implementation of the `Events as a Storage Mechanism <https://cqrs.wordpress.com/documents/events-as-storage-mechanism/>`_ concept (`PDF here <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9162958/CQRS/Events%20as%20a%20Storage%20Mechanism%20CQRS.pdf>`_). It is an implementation of the actual storage for events. The implementation follows the excellent article by Greg Young: `Building an Event Storage <https://cqrs.wordpress.com/documents/building-event-storage/>`_. (`PDF Here <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9162958/CQRS/Building%20an%20Event%20Storage%20CQRS.pdf>`_). Reading the linked articles should provide sufficient understanding of the code.
