        -------------------
        
        A low-level interface to a growing number of Amazon Web Services. The
        botocore package is the foundation for
        `AWS-CLI <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli>`__.
        
        `Documentation <https://botocore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__
        
        **WARNING**
        
        Botocore is currently under a developer preview, and its API is subject
        to change prior to a GA (1.0) release.  Until botocore reaches a 1.0 release,
        backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
