Description: ============================================================
        Workflow transition based on publication and expiration date
        ============================================================
        
        Once one of the effective range dates was reached an automatic workflow transition is executed and changes the workflow state with its managed permissions.
        
        This is intended as an alternative implementation of the `Dexterity <http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.app.dexterity/docs/index.html>`_ IPublication behavior.
        
        .. contents:: Table of Contents
        
        Motivation
        ==========
        
        Because the Plone default publication and expiration functionality lacks in terms of security we decided to create this addon.
        
        For instance: In default Plone if a contents publication date is not reached, it does not show up in the navigation, the search and so on.
        But it can still be accessed directly, by entering its URL, by a json request, or in many other ways. The same is true for expired content.
        
        For contents that need more security, we want proper security handling using zopes access control mechanism and CMF/plones workflow functionality.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        In your buildout or ``setup.py`` depend on ``collective.wfeffectiverange``.
        
        Properly configure `Products.cron4plone as described here <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.cron4plone/1.1.10>`_.
        
        Run buildout.
        
        In your profiles ``metadata.xml`` depend on ``profile-collective.wfeffectiverange:default`` or manually activate it in Plone control panels addon section.
        
        In your content types GenericSetup XML file replace ``<element value="plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata.IDublinCore"/>`` by::
        
          <element value="plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata.IBasic"/>
          <element value="collective.wfeffectiverange.behaviors.IWFEffectiveRange"/>
          <element value="plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata.ICategorization"/>
          <element value="plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata.IOwnership"/>
        
        Alternatively - when working TTW - do the same in the ``Dexterity content types`` control panel under the Behavior tab.
        
        Configure the cronjob in the Plone control panel cron4plone section.
        To check every minute enter::

        Use cases
        =========
        
        On Publish
        ----------
        
        - The user creates an unpublished content item.
        - The user sets a publication date and time in the future. With this date he has to select a valid workflow transition.
        - Valid means, it is a workflow transition which would be possible to select from plones default plone workflow menu.
        - The selected transition will be automatically executed at the given date and time.
        
        
        On Expiration
        -------------
        
        - First the user creates and publishes the content.
        - Then the user edits again and sets a expiration date and time in the future. With this date he has to select a valid workflow transition.
        - Valid means, it is a workflow transition which would be possible to select from plones default plone workflow menu.
        - The selected transition will be automatically executed at the given date and time.
        
        
        On Both
        -------
        
        - The user created an unpublished content.
        - Then the user sets a publication date and time in the future. With this date he has to select a valid workflow transition.
        - Valid means, it is a workflow transition which would be possible to select from plones default plone workflow menu.
        - Then he also sets an expiration date and time in the future, after the publication date.
        - With this date he has to select a valid workflow transition.
        - Here valid means, a workflow transition from the target state of the transition entered for the publication associated states.
        - The selected transitions are automatically executed at the given date and time.
        
        
        Abort manual set transition
        ---------------------------
        
        - The user has set an publication or expiration date like in the use case 1, 2 or 3.
        - The user selects a workflow from the plone default workflow menu, or invokes it in any other way.
        - The workflow transition will be aborted and an error message is shown.
        
        
        Publication date in past
        ------------------------
        
        - The user edits content created by use case 1 after the publication date and the transition was executed.
        - Now the publication transition field is empty and can not be set because the publication date is in the past.
        
        
        Re-Editing
        ----------
        
        - The user edits content created by use case 1 after the publication date and the transition was executed.
        - Then the user can follow use case 2.
        
        
        Implementation
        ==============
        
        The use cases are implemented by providing a dexterity behavior, zope cronjob (cron4plone) and a workflow subscriber.
        
        For each content type where this behavior is set, it will lookup the workflow gets the possible transitions and provides them as a zope vocabulary. It will also check that the selected transitions don't interfere with each other.
        
        Under the edit section, the dates tab will be replaced.
        This behavior will replace publication/expiration fields within the dates tab and adds a fields to select the target workflow transition, including vocabularies, validations and invariants.
        
        A server-side json view delivers the transitions for the expiration date after a publishing date is set, in order to provide a proper vocabulary.
        
        In order to make it work, you have to configure a cron job to check if the desired workflow transition date has been met. See install section
        
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        No support if a content type has two workflows.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
        
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
        
        0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
           a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
           under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
           refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
           means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
           that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
           either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
           language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
           the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
        
           Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
           covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
           running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
           is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
           Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
           Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
        
        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
           source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
           conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
           copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
           notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
           and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
           along with the Program.
        
           You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
           you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
        
        2  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
           of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
           distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
           above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        
           a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
        
           b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
           whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
           part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
           parties under the terms of this License.
        
           c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
           when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
           interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
           announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
           notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
           a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
           these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
           License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
           does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
           the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
        
           These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
           identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
           and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
           themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
           sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
           distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
           on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
           this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
           entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
        
           Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
           your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
           exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
           collective works based on the Program.
        
           In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
           with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
           a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
           the scope of this License.
        
        3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
           under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
           Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
        
           a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
           source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
           1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
        
           b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
           years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
           cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
           machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
           distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
           customarily used for software interchange; or,
        
           c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
           to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
           allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
           received the program in object code or executable form with such
           an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
        
           The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
           making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
           code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
           associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
           control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
           special exception, the source code distributed need not include
           anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
           form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
           operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
           itself accompanies the executable.
        
           If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
           access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
           access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
           distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
           compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
        
        4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
           except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
           otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
           void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
           However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
           this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
           parties remain in full compliance.
        
        5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
           signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
           distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
           prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
           modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
           Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
           all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
           the Program or works based on it.
        
        6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
           Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
           original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
           these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
           restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
           You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
           this License.
        
        7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
           infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
           conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
           otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
           excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
           distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
           License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
           may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
           license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
           all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
           the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
           refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
        
           If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
           any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
           apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
           circumstances.
        
           It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
           patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
           such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
           integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
           implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
           generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
           through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
           system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
           to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
           impose that choice.
        
           This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
           be a consequence of the rest of this License.
        
        8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
           certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
           original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
           may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
           those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
           countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
           the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
        
        9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
           of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
           be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
           address new problems or concerns.
        
           Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
           specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
           later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
           either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
           Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
           this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
           Foundation.
        
        10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
            programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
            to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
            Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
