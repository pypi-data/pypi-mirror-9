:clipboard: pretty ASCII printing of tabular data in python :snake:

## About
`tableprint` lets you easily print pretty ASCII formatted tables of data.
Unlike other modules, you can print single rows of data at a time (useful for printing ongoing computation results).
Also, `tableprint` is fast (minimal processing required) and is therefore relevant for printing updates during speed-intensive computations.
