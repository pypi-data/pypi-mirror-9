python-ldap:
python-ldap provides an object-oriented API to access LDAP directory servers
from Python programs. Mainly it wraps the OpenLDAP 2.x libs for that purpose.
Additionally the package contains modules for other LDAP-related stuff
(e.g. processing LDIF, LDAPURLs, LDAPv3 schema, LDAPv3 extended operations
and controls, etc.). 

This Product includes software developed by:
 - OpenLDAP Foundation.
 - OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/).
 - Computing Services at Carnegie Mellon University (http://www.cmu.edu/computing/).
 - Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan (Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden).
