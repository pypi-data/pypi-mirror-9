In your projects urls.py, this is to be included in a form similar to:

        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            url(r'^indexdata/', include('eulfedora.indexdata.urls', namespace='indexdata')),
            #Additional url patterns here,
        )
'''

from django.conf.urls import *

urlpatterns = patterns('eulfedora.indexdata.views',
    url(r'^$', 'index_config', name='index_config'),
    url(r'^(?P<id>[^/]+)/$', 'index_data', name='index_data'),
)
