"""
Generic, re-usable views for use with Fedora-based Django
projects. These views expose data intended for use with
:mod:`eulindexer`. These views currently return data in JSON form.

Projects that use this module should include the following settings in their
``settings.py``::

    # Index server url. In this example case, we are wish to push data to a Solr instance.
    SOLR_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:8983/solr/"
    # IPs that will be allowed to access the indexdata views
    EUL_INDEXER_ALLOWED_IPS = "ANY" #Or put in a list such as ("127.0.0.1", "127.0.0.2")

    # OPTIONAL SETTING: A list of lists of content models you want this application to index.
    # If this setting is missing, the code will automatically detect all content
    # models the application is using. In this example, it will index items with BOTH
    # content-model_1 and content-model_2 as well as those that have just content-model_3.
    EUL_INDEXER_CONTENT_MODELS = "[['content-model_1', 'content-model_2'], ['content-model_3']]"

To use these views in your :mod:`eulfedora` -based application, make
sure that ``eulfedora`` is included in INSTALLED_APPS in your ``settings.py``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'eulfedora'
        # Additional installed applications here,
    )

And then bind the indexdata views to a url in your application
``urls.py``::

    from django.conf.urls import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^indexdata/', include('eulfedora.indexdata.urls', namespace='indexdata')),
        # Additional url patterns here,
    )


An example Solr schema with fields defined for all the index values
exposed in the default
:meth:`~eulfedora.models.DigitalObject.index_data` method is included
with :mod:`eulfedora.indexdata` to be used as a starting point for
applications.
