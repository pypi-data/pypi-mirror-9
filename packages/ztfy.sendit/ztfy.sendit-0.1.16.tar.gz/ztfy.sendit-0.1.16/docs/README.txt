Introduction
============

ztfy.sendit is a small package which provides an application which authenticated users can
use to send files to remote contacts, like in SendIt web site.

It's main use case is for principals from inside an organization who want to share documents
with their remote contacts; contacts selection can be done via any registered authentication
plug-in.

You can customize your application so that external users registration is opened or made only
by organization's inner principals.
