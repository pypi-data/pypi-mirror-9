        Introduction
        ============
        
        It is known that DNA methylation plays important roles in regulation
        of cell development and differentiation. DNA methylation/unmethylation
        mechanisms are common in all tissue/cell. However, different cell 
        types with the same genome have different methylomes. Recently,
        high-throughput sequencing combining bisulfite treatment (Bisulfite
        -Seq) have been used to generate DNA methylomes from a wide range of
        human tissue/cell types at a genome-wide perspective. To characterize
        the genome regions that consist of continuous CpGs with similar 
        methylation specificity, we developed the Specific Methylation Analysis
        and Report Tool (SMART) based on the quantified methylation specificity,
        Euclidean distance and similarity entropy. SMART aims to segment the 
        genome into different functional regions based on the methylation
        pattern in multiple cell types. Continuous scanning is firstly carried
        out to obtain the primary segments composed by CpG sites with high 
        methylation similarity across all cell types. Then, the primary segments
        those localize in close proximity and share similar methylation pattern
        are merged into different types of segments including high specificity 
        segment (HighSpe), low specificity segment (LowSpe) and almost no 
        cell-specificity segment (NoSpe). At last, the cell-type-specific 
        methylation marks were identified to facilitate the epigenetic analysis.

        Example
        ==============
        
        Example data
        ---------------
        
        The example data can be found in the directory Example under the installation directory of SMART. It should be noted that the location of installation directory of SMART may be different in different Operating System. The Cytosines and their methylation level in 50kb regions from chr3 and chr6 were extracted for test of SMART. User can use following command to test SMART.
        
        Example command
        ---------------------
        :For Linux: 
        
        The main function SMART may be in /usr/local/bin/, and example data may be in ../python2.7/dist-packages/SMART/Example. The following referece may be useful for test of SMART::
        
          SMART /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/SMART/Example/BSSeq_fortest/ /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/SMART/Example/CLoc_hg19_fortest/ -n Test -o /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/SMART/Example/Example_Results/
        
        
        
        :For windows: 
        
        The main function SMART may be in ..\\Python27\\Scripts\\, and example data may be in ..\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\\SMART\\Example. The following referece may be useful for test of SMART::
        
          cd  ..\Python27\Scripts\
          python SMART ..\Python27\Lib\site-packages\SMART\Example\BSSeq_fortest\ ..\Python27\Lib\site-packages\SMART\Example\CLoc_hg19_fortest\ -n Test -o ..\Python27\Lib\site-packages\SMART\Example\Example_Results\
        
        
        Output Files 
        ==============
        1. Folder SplitedMethy is a a output directory to store the splited Methylation data.
           The methylation data are stored in different chromosome sub-folders. In each
           sub-folder, the methylation data for all samples are included. 
        2. Folder MethylationSpecificity is a output directory to store the methylation
           levels and specifity for each C which is common across all samples. These files are
           stored in chromosomes. In this folder, MethylationSpecificity.wig.gz includes
           the methylation specifity of all common C. And this file can be uploaded to UCSC
           browser for visualization.
        3. Folder MethylationSegment includes three sub-folders: GenomeSegment, GenomeSegmentMethy,
           and MergedGenomeSegment. The sub-folder GenomeSegment stores all small segments
           identified by SMART in each chromosome. And the sub-folder GenomeSegmentMethy stores
           the methylation levels of each small segments across all samples which may be useful for
           users' local further analysis. The sub-folder MergedGenomeSegment stores the larger 
           segments merged based on the small segments in each chromosome. The final results are
           generated based on these merged segments.
        4. Folder FinalResults includes all intresting results which may be concerned by users.
           In this folder, there are six files. 
        
           -The first file 1SmallSegmentBed.txt.gz stores all small segments in bed format,  which  can be uploaded to UCSC browser for visualization.
        
           -The second file 2MergedSegmentBed.txt.gz stores all merged segments in bed format, which  can be uploaded to UCSC browser for visualization.
        
           -The third file 3MergedSegment.txt stores all merged segments in txt format, which is useful  for local further analysis.
        
           -The fourth file 4MergedSegmentwithmethylation.txt stores the methylation levels of all  merged segments across all samples, which is useful for local further analysis.
        
           -The fifth file 5MergedHighLowSpeSegmentwithspecificity.txt stores the methylation specificity and p values of t-test for each merged HighSpe/LowSpe segement, which is useful for further analysis on cell-type-specificity for each HighSpe/LowSpe segement. The positive p value represents the segment is hyper-methylated in the corresbonding cell-type, while the negative p value represents the segment is hypo-methylated in the corresbonding cell-type.
        
           -The sixth file 6CellTypeSpecificMethymarkPvalue.txt is a reformated file for the fifth file. In this file, only the HighSpe/LowSpe segements which show significant hypo- or hyper-methylation in some cell-types are remained. This file is usefull for users to select and analyze cell-type-specific methylation marks including HypoMarks and HyperMarks.
