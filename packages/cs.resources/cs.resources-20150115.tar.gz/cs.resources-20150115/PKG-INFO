        NestingOpenClosedMixin
        ----------------------
        
        This is a mixin class for objects with multiple open/close users.
        After the last .close, the object's .shutdown method is called.
        This also presented the context manager interface to allow open/close thus::
        
          with obj:
            do stuff while open
        
        @notclosed
        ----------
        
        Decorator for object methods which must not be called after the object is closed.
