Configuration
-------------

Central module for storing and working with a live configuration objects.  This
module instances :class:`.ConfigurationWithCallbacks` onto :const:`.config`.
Attempting to reload this module will not reinstance the :const:`.config`
object.

The :const:`.config` object should be directly imported from this
module to be used:
