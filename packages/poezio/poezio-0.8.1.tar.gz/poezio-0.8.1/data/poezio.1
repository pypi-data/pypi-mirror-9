is a console jabber (XMPP) client written in Python and using ncurses to draw its interface. It aims at being similar to the most famous IRC clients, like weechat or irssi. The keyboard shortcuts are inspired from emacs. For more information on XMPP see http://xmpp.org and on Poezio see http://poezio.eu

.SH "COMMANDS"
Most commands support tab completion, both for their names and for their arguments. You can use the \fI/help\fR command to list all available commands, and \fI/help <command>\fR for a complete description of <command>.

The following is a basic description of the most widely used commands; you should refer to \fI/help\fR inside poezio for more documentation. \fI<foo>\fR denotes a obligatory argument, while \fI[bar]\fR is an optional argument (without argument, the \fI/remove\fR command, for example, acts on the currently selected contact)
