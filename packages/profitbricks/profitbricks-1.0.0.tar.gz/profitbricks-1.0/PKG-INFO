        ## Concepts
        
        The Python Client Library wraps the latest version of the ProfitBricks REST API. All API operations are performed over SSL and authenticated using your ProfitBricks portal credentials. The API can be accessed within an instance running in ProfitBricks or directly over the Internet from any application that can send an HTTPS request and receive an HTTPS response. 
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Before you begin you will need to have [signed-up](https://www.profitbricks.com/signup) for a ProfitBricks account. The credentials you setup during sign-up will be used to authenticate against the API. 
         
        ## Installation
        
        The Python Client Library is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/profitbricks). You can install the latest stable version using pip:
        
            pip install profitbricks
            
        Done!
        
        ## Authenticating
        
        Connecting to ProfitBricks is handled by first setting up your authentication.  
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
        You can now use `client` for any future request. 
        
        ## Using the Module
        
        Here are a few examples on how to use the module. In this first one we pull a list of our datacenters. 
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            datacenters = client.list_datacenters()
        
        And in this one we reserve an IPBlock:
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService, IPBlock
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            i = IPBlock(location='de/fra', size=5)
        
            ipblock = client.reserve_ipblock(i)
        
        Some object creation supports simple and complex requests, such as a server which can be created simply by doing this: 
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
            from profitbricks.client import Server, NIC, Volume
        
            datacenter_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba022'
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            i = Server(
                name='server1',
                ram=4096,
                cores=4
                )
            
            response = client.create_server(
                datacenter_id=datacenter_id,
                server=i)
        
        or if you want one with some volumes and NICs you would do: 
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
            from profitbricks.client import Server, NIC, Volume
        
            server_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba023'
            datacenter_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba022'
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            nic1 = NIC(
                name='nic1',
                ips=['10.2.2.3'],
                dhcp='true',
                lan=1,
                firewall_active=True,
                )
        
            nic2 = NIC(
                name='nic2',
                ips=['10.2.3.4'],
                dhcp='true',
                lan=1,
                firewall_active=True,
                )
        
            volume1 = Volume(
                name='volume1',
                size=56,
                image='<IMAGE/SNAPSHOT-ID>',
                bus='VIRTIO'
                )
        
            volume2 = Volume(
                name='volume2',
                size=56,
                image='<IMAGE/SNAPSHOT-ID>',
                bus='VIRTIO'
                )
        
            nics = [nic1, nic2]
            create_volumes = [volume1, volume2]
        
            i = Server(
                name='server1',
                ram=4096,
                cores=4,
                nics=nics,
                create_volumes=create_volumes
                )
        
            response = client.create_server(
                datacenter_id=datacenter_id, server=i)

        ## How to: Create a Datacenter
        
        ProfitBricks introduces the concept of Virtual Datacenters. These are logically separated from one and the other and allow you to have a self-contained environment for all servers, volumes, networking, snapshots, and so forth. The goal is to give you the same experience as you would have if you were running your own physical datacenter.
        
        You will need a datacenter before you can create anything else. Like the server functions, the datacenter functions can be used to create a simple vDC or a complex one. 
        
        To create a simple one you would do this: 
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
            from profitbricks.client import Datacenter, Volume, Server
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            i = Datacenter(
                username='username',
                password='password',
                name='datacenter1',
                description='My New Datacenter',
                location='de/fkb'
                )
        
            response = client.create_datacenter(datacenter=i)
        
        To create a complex datacenter you would do this. As you can see, you can create quite a few of the objects you will need later all in one request. These all get serialized in a request queue which you can check using the Requests functions: 
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
            from profitbricks.client import Datacenter, Volume, Server
            from profitbricks.client import LAN, NIC, LoadBalancer, FirewallRule
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            fwrule1 = FirewallRule(
                name='Open SSH port',
                protocol='TCP',
                source_mac='01:23:45:67:89:00',
                port_range_start=22
                )
        
            fwrule2 = FirewallRule(
                name='Allow PING',
                protocol='ICMP',
                icmp_type=8,
                icmp_code=0
                )
        
            fw_rules = [fwrule1, fwrule2]
        
            nic1 = NIC(
                name='nic1',
                ips=['10.2.2.3'],
                dhcp='true',
                lan=1,
                firewall_active=True,
                firewall_rules=fw_rules
                )
        
            nic2 = NIC(
                name='nic2',
                ips=['10.2.3.4'],
                dhcp='true',
                lan=1,
                firewall_active=True,
                firewall_rules=fw_rules
                )
        
            nics = [nic1, nic2]
        
            volume1 = Volume(
                name='volume1',
                size=56,
                image='<IMAGE/SNAPSHOT-ID>',
                bus='VIRTIO'
                )
        
            volume2 = Volume(
                name='volume2',
                size=56,
                image='<IMAGE/SNAPSHOT-ID>',
                bus='VIRTIO'
                )
        
            volumes = [volume2]
        
            server1 = Server(
                name='server1',
                ram=4096,
                cores=4,
                nics=nics,
                create_volumes=[volume1]
                )
        
            servers = [server1]
        
            balancednics = ['<NIC-ID-1>', '<NIC-ID-2>']
        
            loadbalancer1 = LoadBalancer(
                name='My LB',
                balancednics=balancednics)
        
            loadbalancers = [loadbalancer1]
        
            lan1 = LAN(
                name='public Lan 4',
                public=True
                )
        
            lan2 = LAN(
                name='public Lan 4',
                public=True
                )
        
            lans = [lan1, lan2]
        
            d = Datacenter(
                name='datacenter1',
                description='my DC',
                location='de/fkb',
                servers=servers,
                volumes=volumes,
                loadbalancers=loadbalancers,
                lans=lans
                )
        
            response = client.create_datacenter(datacenter=d)
        
        ## How to: Delete a Datacenter
        
        You will want to exercise a bit of caution here. Removing a datacenter will **destroy** all objects contained within that datacenter -- servers, volumes, snapshots, and so on. The objects -- once removed -- will be unrecoverable. 
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            datacenter_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-
            datacenter = client.delete_datacenter(datacenter_id=datacenter_id)
        
        ## How to: Update Cores, Memory, and Disk
        
        ProfitBricks allows users to dynamically update cores, memory, and disk independently of each other. This removes the restriction of needing to upgrade to the next size up to receive an increase in memory. You can now simply increase the instances memory keeping your costs in-line with your resource needs. 
        
        The following code illustrates how you can update cores and memory: 
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
        
            datacenter_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba022'
            server_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba023'
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            server = client.update_server(
                datacenter_id=datacenter_id,
                server_id=server_id,
                cores=16,
                ram=2048)
        
         This is how you would update your volume's size: 
         
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService, Volume
            
            datacenter_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba022'
            volume_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba025'
            
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
            
            volume = client.update_volume(
                datacenter_id=datacenter_id,
                volume_id=volume_id,
                size=100,
                name='Resized storage to 100 GB',
                cpu_hot_unplug=True)
        
        
        ## How to: List Servers, Volumes, and Data Centers
        
        Listing resources is fairly straight forward. 
        
        Grabbing the datacenters:
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            datacenters = client.list_datacenters() 
        
        Your servers:
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
        
            datacenter_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba022'
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            servers = client.list_servers(datacenter_id=datacenter_id)
        
        Finally, your volumes: 
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService
        
            datacenter_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba022'
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            volumes = self.volume.list_volumes(
                datacenter_id=datacenter_id)
        
        ## How to: Create Additional Network Interfaces
        
        The ProfitBricks platform supports adding multiple NICs to a server. These NICs can be used to create different, segmented networks on the platform. 
        
        The sample below shows you how to add a second NIC to an existing server: 
        
            from profitbricks.client import ProfitBricksService, FirewallRule, NIC
        
            datacenter_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba022'
            server_id = '700e1cab-99b2-4c30-ba8c-1d273ddba023'
        
            client = ProfitBricksService(
                username='username', password='password')
        
            i = NIC(
                name='nic1',
                ips=['10.2.2.3','10.2.3.4'],
                dhcp='true',
                lan=1,
                firewall_active=True
                )
        
            response = client.create_nic(
                datacenter_id=datacenter_id,
                server_id=server_id,
                nic=i)
        
        ## Conclusion
        
        We touched on only a few ways you can interact with the ProfitBricks API using python. Our repo, located [here], has further examples. If you have any other question, ping us in the community.
