        Mandrill Integration cube
        
        provides 2 main features :
        
        1. Hijack the existing functions that call config.sendmails
        
            In these functions, a "sendmails" service is called instead of
            `config.sendmails`, this service being provided by the mandrill cube.
        
            https://www.cubicweb.org/ticket/3797393 proposes to replace
            config.sendmails by a service in the core.
        
        2. Provide an improved NotificationView
        
            Mandrill provides a template api :
            https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/messages.python.html#method=send-template
        
            The MandrillNotificationViewMixin makes use of it and allows to send
            different emails to each recipient.
        
            Beside using the send-template api of mandrill, it gives more control to
            the developer on the sender, and the merge variables for each recipient.
        
            Since it is a Mixin class, it can be mixed in an existing notification to
            make it instantly usable with a mandrill template.
