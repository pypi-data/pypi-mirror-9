        PBS - a PyBossa command line interface
        ======================================
        
        **pbs** is a very simple command line interface to a PyBossa server. It
        allows you to create projects, add tasks (from a CSV, JSON, PO or a
        PROPERTIES file) with a nice progress bar, delete them and update the
        project templates (tutorial, task\_presenter, and descriptions) all from
        the command line.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        pbs is available in Pypi, so you can install the software with pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pip install pybossa-pbs
        
        If you have all the dependencies, the package will be installed and you
        will be able to use it from the command line. The command is: **pbs**.
        
        If you want to hack on the code, just install it but with the
        **--editable** flag after cloning the repository:
        
        ::
        
                git clone https://github.com/PyBossa/pbs.git
                cd pbs
                virtualenv env
                source env/bin/activate
                pip install --editable .
        
        This will install the pbs package, and you'll be able to modify it,
        patch it, etc. If you improve it, please, let us know and share the code
        so we can integrate it back ;-)
        
        Configuring pbs
        ---------------
        
        pbs is very handy when you work with one or two PyBossa servers. The
        best way to configure it is creating a simple config file in your home
        folder:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                cd ~
                vim .pybossa.cfg
        
        The file should have the following structure:
        
        ::
        
            [default]
            server: http://theserver.com
            apikey: yourkey
        
        If you are working with more servers, add another section below it. For
        example:
        
        ::
        
            [default]
            server: http://theserver.com
            apikey: yourkey
        
            [crowdcrafting]
            server: http://crowdcrafting.org
            apikey: yourkeyincrowdcrafting
        
        By default pbs will use the credentials of the section default, so you
        don't have to type anything to use those values. However, if you want to
        do actions in the other server all you have to do is the following:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs --credentials crowdcrafting --help
        
        That command will use the values of the crowdcrafting section.
        
        Creating a project
        ------------------
        
        Creating a project is very simple. All you have to do is create a file
        named **project.json** with the following fields:
        
        .. code:: json
        
            {
                "name": "Flickr Person Finder",
                "short_name": "flickrperson",
                "description": "Image pattern recognition",
                "question": "Do you see a real human face in this photo?"
            }
        
        If you use the name **project.json** you will not have to pass the file
        name via an argument, as it's the named used by default. Once you have
        the file created, run the following command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs create_project
        
        That command should create the project. If you want to see all the
        available options, please check the **--help** command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs create_project --help
        
        Adding tasks to a project
        -------------------------
        
        Adding tasks is very simple. You can have your tasks in three formats:
        
        -  JSON
        -  CSV
        -  PO (any po file that you want to translate)
        -  PROPERTIES (any PROPERTIES file that you want to translate)
        
        Therefore, adding tasks to your project is as simple as this command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs add_tasks --tasks-file tasks_file.json --tasks-type=json
        
        If you want to see all the available options, please check the
        **--help** command:
        
        **NOTE**: By default PyBossa servers use a rate limit for avoiding abuse
        of the API. For this reason, you can only do usually 300 requests per
        every 15 minutes. If you are going to add more than 300 tasks, pbs will
        detect it and warn you, auto-enabling the throttling for you to respect
        the limits.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs add_tasks --help
        
        Updating project templates
        --------------------------
        
        Now that you have added tasks, you can work in your templates. All you
        have to do to add/update the templates to your project is running the
        following command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs update_project
        
        That command needs to have in the same folder where you are running it,
        the following files:
        
        -  template.html
        -  long\_description.md
        -  tutorial.html
        
        If you want to use another template, you can via arguments:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs update_project --template /tmp/template.html
        
        If you want to see all the available options, please check the
        **--help** command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs update_project --help
        
        Updating tasks redundancy from a project
        ----------------------------------------
        
        If you need it, you can update the redundancy of a task using its ID or
        all the tasks skipping the ID. For example, to update the redundancy of
        one task to 5:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs update-task-redundancy --task-id 34234 --redundancy 5
        
        To update all of them:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs update-task-redundancy --redundancy 5
        
        **Note**: without the --redundancy argument it will revert the
        redundancy to the default value: 30.
        
        This last command will confirm that you want to update all the tasks.
        
        If you want to see all the available options, please check the
        **--help** command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs update-task-redundancy --help
        
        Deleting tasks from a project
        -----------------------------
        
        If you need it, you can delete all the tasks from your project, or only
        one using its task.id. For deleting all the tasks, all you've to do is
        run the following command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs delete_tasks
        
        This command will confirm that you want to delete all the tasks and
        associated task\_runs.
        
        If you want to see all the available options, please check the
        **--help** command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pbs delete_tasks --help
