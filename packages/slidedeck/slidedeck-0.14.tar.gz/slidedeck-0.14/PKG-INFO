Description: This is a repackaging of the google io 2012 slidedeck,
        to be a little easier to use and more suitable for scientific
        presentations.
        
        Example slides: http://cdn.rawgit.com/rmcgibbo/slidedeck-example/master/index.html
        
        You edit and author your entire presentation in markdown. All the metadata
        about your presentation is set within the markdown file, including things
        like the title and author. You run `slidedeck create` to make a new deck.
        This will create a new directory with your project. In particular, there will
        be a fine in there called slides.md that contains the markdown source for
        your slides. `slidedeck render` will render your deck from markdown to html5.
        `slidedeck watch` will watch your project and rerender the slides whenever
        you change the content (useful for iterative development).
