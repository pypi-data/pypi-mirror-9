pytest-runner
=============

Setup scripts can use pytest-runner to add setup.py test support for pytest
runner.

Usage
-----

- Add 'pytest-runner' to your 'setup_requires'. Pin to '>=2.0,<3dev' (or
  similar) to avoid pulling in incompatible versions.
- Include 'pytest' and any other testing requirements to 'tests_require'.
- Invoke tests with `setup.py pytest`.
- Pass `--index-url` to have test requirements downloaded from an alternate
  index URL.
- Pass additional py.test command-line options using `--addopts`.
- Set options in the `[pytest]` section of setup.cfg.

See the `jaraco.util <https://bitbucket.org/jaraco/jaraco.util/>`_ project
for an example.

Changes

* Honor ``.eggs`` directory for transient downloads as introduced in Setuptools
  7.0.

* The preferred invocation is now the 'pytest' command.

* Removed support for the alternate usage. The recommended usage (as a
  distutils command) is now the only supported usage.
* Removed support for the --junitxml parameter to the ptr command. Clients
  should pass the same parameter (and all other py.test arguments) to py.test
  via the --addopts parameter.

1.1
~~~

* Added support for --addopts to pass any arguments through to py.test.
* Deprecated support for --junitxml. Use --addopts instead. --junitxml will be
  removed in 2.0.
