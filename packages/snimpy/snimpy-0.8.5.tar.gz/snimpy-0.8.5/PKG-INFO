        Interactive SNMP tool.
        
        *Snimpy* is a Python-based tool providing a simple interface to build
        SNMP query. Here is a very simplistic example that allows us to
        display the routing table of a given host::
        
            load("IP-FORWARD-MIB")
            m=M("localhost", "public", 2)
            routes = m.ipCidrRouteNextHop
            for x in routes:
                net, netmask, tos, src = x
                print("%15s/%-15s via %-15s src %-15s" % (net, netmask, routes[x], src))
        
        You can either use *Snimpy* interactively throught its console
        (derived from Python own console or from IPython_ if available) or
        write *Snimpy* scripts which are just Python scripts with some global
        variables available.

        * Free software: ISC license
        * Documentation: http://snimpy.rtfd.org.
        
        *Snimpy* requires libsmi_ to work correctly. See the documentation for
        more information.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        *Snimpy* is aimed at being the more Pythonic possible. You should forget
        that you are doing SNMP requests. *Snimpy* will rely on MIB to hide SNMP
        details. Here are some "features":
        
        * MIB parser based on libsmi  (through CFFI)
        * SNMP requests are handled by PySNMP (SNMPv1, SNMPv2 and SNMPv3
          support)
        * scalars are just attributes of your session object
        * columns are like a Python dictionary and made available as an
          attribute
        * getting an attribute is like issuing a GET method
        * setting an attribute is like issuing a SET method
        * iterating over a table is like using GETNEXT
        * when something goes wrong, you get an exception
