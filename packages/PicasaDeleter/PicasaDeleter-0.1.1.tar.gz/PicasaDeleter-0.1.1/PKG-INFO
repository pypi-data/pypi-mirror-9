        So, you've decided you don't want all your photos in Google+/Picasa after all? (Maybe you used the autobackup tool, but decided you weren't so keen on the service, then realised that deleting all the photos required you to click thousands of buttons!)
        
        This simple script uses the Google Data APIs to delete all the albums and photos in your Picasa albums account.
        
        If you want something more specific (e.g. to only delete photos above a certain size, or from a certain date range) then feel free to enhance the script and contribute the enhancements!
