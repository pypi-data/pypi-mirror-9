def patchFileContentTypes(root):
   """
   For reasons beyond my understanding, on Python 2.7.7, the MIME type map in
   `twisted.web.static.File.contentTypes` ends up having values (not all) that
   are of type unicode. This breaks stuff further down the line, since twisted
   will bail out "data must not be unicode" when the HTTP header with the
   respective content type is written.

   We work around by patching the map.

   See also: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7461

   Update: the origin is http://bugs.python.org/issue21652

   It is specific to CPython 2.7.7 on Windows. It is fixed in 2.7.8.
