        This is an unofficial Python API for Bamboo HR. So far it is focusing on
        managing employee information but the plans are to have 100% API
        coverage eventually.
        
        The library makes use of the
        `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`__ library for
        Python and `HTTPretty <https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/HTTPretty>`__
        for testing. A huge thank you to both of those excellent projects.
        
        Using this library is very simple:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR
        
            bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere')
        
            employees = bamboo.get_employee_directory()
        
        (Note that you have to enable sharing employee directory to use that
        method.)
        
        This will give you a list of employees with properties on each including
        their ID.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR
        
            bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere')
        
            # Jim's employee ID is 123 and we are not specifying fields so this will get all of them.
            jim = bamboo.get_employee(123)
        
            # Pam's employee ID is 222 and we are specifying fields so this will get only the ones we request.
            pam = bamboo.get_employee(222, ['city', 'workPhone', 'workEmail'])
        
        Adding an employee
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR
        
            bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere')
        
            # The firstName and lastName keys are required...
            employee = {'firstName': 'Test', 'lastName': 'Person'}
        
            result = bamboo.add_employee(employee)
        
            The result dict will contain id and location. "id" is the numerical BambooHR employee ID. Location is a link to that employee.
        
        Updating an employee
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR
        
            bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere')
        
            # His name was test person...
            employee = {'firstName': 'Another', 'lastName': 'Namenow'}
        
            # Use the ID and then the dict with the new information
            result = bamboo.update_employee(333, employee)
        
            result will be True or False depending on if it succeeded.
        
        Requesting a Report
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR
        
            bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere')
        
            # Use the ID to request json information
            result = bamboo.request_company_report(1, format='json', filter_duplicates=True)
        
            # Now do stuff with your results (Will vary by report.)
            for employee in result['employees']:
                print(employee)
        
            # Use the ID and save a pdf:
            result = bamboo.request_company_report(1, format='pdf', output_file='/tmp/report.pdf', filter_duplicates=True)
