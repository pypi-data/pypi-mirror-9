        ==========
        
        ``ftw.avatar`` generates a personal default avatar for new Plone users.
        
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Simply install the ``ftw.avatar`` egg by adding it to the dependencies in your package
        or by adding it to your buildout configuration::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                ftw.avatar
        
        There is no need to install the addon in the Plone site, it automatically hooks in.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Generating avatars requires a `Pillow`_ (or PIL) installation with `freetype`_ support.
        
        ``freetype`` can easily be installed on OS X with `homebrew`_::
        
            $ brew install freetype
        
        After installing ``freetype`` Pillow may need to be rebuilt.
        
        
        
        
        Default avatar generation
        -------------------------
        
        ``ftw.avatar`` generates default avatars for users which have not yet defined
        an avatar (Personal portrait) in the personal preferences.
        The avatar is generated with a random background color and two characters of
        their name.
        
        **Examples:**

        Plone patches
        -------------
        
        **Maximum user portait scale**
        
        ``Products.PlonePAS`` limits the maximum size of user portraits
        (a.k.a. avatars) to  75x100.
        ``ftw.avatar`` increases the size to a maximum of 300x300, allowing to
        build pages with bigger avatars such as user pages.
        
        
        **Default user portrait patch**
        
        ``ftw.avatar`` patches ``Products.PlonePAS`` to generate a default avatar
        when the user portrait is retrieved the first time and the user has not yet
        set an avatar.
        ``membership_tool.getPersonalPortrait()`` is patched.
        
        
        
        Avatar scaling
        --------------
        
        ``ftw.avatar`` extends the avatar default view to accept a scaling parameter.
        The ``size`` parameter is used as maximum width and maximum height for
        the scale.
        
        Example URL: ``http://localhost:8080/Plone/portal_memberdata/portraits/admin?size=26``
        
        
        
        Font licensing
        --------------
        
        For generating the avatar the font ``Fantasque Sans Mono`` is used.
        The font is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, see the
        `License File <https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.avatar/blob/master/ftw/avatar/font/OFL.txt>`_
