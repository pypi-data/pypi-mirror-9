    It is very easy to link a button to a command.  For instance, you could
    link the trigger button of a joystick to a "score" command.

    have something unusual (for instance, if they want to react to the user
    holding a button while the robot is reading a certain sensor input).
    For this, they only have to write the :func:`get` method to get the full
