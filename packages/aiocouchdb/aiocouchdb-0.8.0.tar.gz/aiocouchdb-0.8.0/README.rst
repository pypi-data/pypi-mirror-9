CouchDB client built on top of `aiohttp`_ and made for `asyncio`_.

Current status: **beta**. `aiocouchdb` has all CouchDB API implements up to
1.6.1 release. However, it may lack of some usability and stability bits, but
work is in progress. Feel free to `send pull request`_ or `open issue`_ if
you'd found something that should be fixed.

Features:

- Modern CouchDB client for Python 3.3+ based on `aiohttp`_
- Complete CouchDB API support (JSON and Multipart) up to 1.6.1 version
- Multiuser workflow with Basic Auth, Cookie, Proxy and OAuth support
- Stateless behavior
- Stream-like handling views, changes feeds and bulk docs upload

Roadmap (not exactly in that order):

- Cloudant support
- CouchDB 2.0 support
- ElasticSearch CouchDB river support
- GeoCouch support
- Microframework for OS daemons and external handlers
- Native integration with Python Query Server
- Replicator-as-a-Library / Replicator-as-a-Service
- Stateful API

Requirements
============

- Python 3.3+
