Django-rinvoices - Installation instructions
=============================================

Creating an enviroment for your project
---------------------------------------

You have to create an environment where everything will be installed.
Create first the directory where the environment will be created and
enter in the enviroment:

::
	$ mkdir myproject
	$ cd myproject
	$ virtualenv --distribute env
	$ source env/bin/activate


Creating a new django project
-----------------------------

Once you're into the enviroment, next step involves creating a new
django project. So, being inside the virtual environment, we must
install django (required dependency, of course) and then, create the project:

::

	$ pip install django


Installing Django-rinvoices
-----------------------------

Now we have a real project, we're ready to import Django-rinvoices, so
we can handle it managing the following pip command:

::

    $ pip install django-rinvoices

Configuring project
-------------------

We have to configure a new project. The package is provided with a
sample Django app (rinvoices-example), so we can use it (if you want to start from
scratch). Otherwise you have to "merge" the urls.py and settings.py files:

::

	$ cp -r env/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rinvoices/rinvoices-example/ src/
	$ cd src/
	$ python manage.py syncdb
	$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000


::
	http://localhost:8000/rinvoices/
	http://localhost:8000/admin/rinvoices/

Templates
---------

If you want to override the templates you only have to copy them from
sample Django app (rinvoices-example) to your project and change all what
you need.
