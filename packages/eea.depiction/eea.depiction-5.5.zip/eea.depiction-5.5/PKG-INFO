        Introduction
        ============
        `EEA Depiction`_ (formerly valentine.imagescales) is a generic system for
        creating thumbnails/image representations for content types,
        both those provided by Plone, and custom ones.
        
        At the moment this system is implemented and tested only on Archetypes
        content types, however this system could be adapted in a later version
        to work also for dexterity content types.
        
        To make it work for a content type, three adapters need to be provided:
        
        1. ImageView that retrieves an image in the desired scale.
        2. ImageTag that returns the HTML tag for the image
        3. ImageLink that returns the HTML link to the image.
        
        
        Upgrade notes
        =============
        
        As of **eea.depiction 5.2** we customize the following resources in order to
        display any items in thumbnail listings:
        
        1. **atctListAlbum.py** - which is responsible for displaying items in
           *atct_album_view.pt*
        2. **thumbnail_view.pt** - which is the browser template responsible for
           thumbnail listing for the *plone.app.collection* package
        
        .. contents::
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        zc.buildout
        -----------
        If you are using `zc.buildout`_ and the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Update your buildout.cfg file:
        
          * Add ``eea.depiction`` to the list of eggs to install
          * Tell the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_ recipe to install a ZCML slug
        
          ::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            eggs =
              ...
              eea.depiction
        
            zcml =
              ...
              eea.depiction-overrides
              eea.depiction
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
        
        
        How to specify fallback preview images
        ======================================
        eea.depiction 0.3 introduces the concept of fallback images when the regular
        image traversal fails. The logic works like this:
        
        1. Look for an image returned by the contexts 'imgview' adapter
        2. If the imgview crashes, isn't found or can not locate/generate an image,
           we continue by checking if there's an image specified for any of the
           contexts interfaces.
        3. If there's no fallback image, we look for an image for the context
           portal type, e.g. article, news-item, document. This should be placed
           in the 'portal_depiction' utility (Site Setup > Depiction Library)
        4. Uses the generic content type image, i.e. portal_depiction/generic
        
        Thus:
        
        1. To map a fallback image to a portal type, place it in this folder and name
           it after the portal type.
        2. To map a fallback image to an interface just add a named-utility for
           IDepictionVocabulary (see eea.depiction.vocabularies)
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        `EEA Depiction`_ has the following dependencies:
          - Plone 4+
          - Pillow
        
        This package also supports p4a.video. Thus the following dependencies are optional:
          - p4a.video
