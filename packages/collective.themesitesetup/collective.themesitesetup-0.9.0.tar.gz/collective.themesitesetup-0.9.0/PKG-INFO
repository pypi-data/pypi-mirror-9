        **collective.themesitesetup** is a plugin for `plone.app.theming`_. With this
        plugin it's possible to embed automatically imported generic setup profiles
        into a zipped theme package: one to be imported when theme is activated from
        the theming control panel, and the other one to be imported when theme is
        deactivated (as so called *uninstall profile*).
        
        .. _plone.app.theming: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.theming
        
        **Note:** Due to regression in *plone.app.theming*, this package will work only
        when a fixing pull for it is accepted and new version released (1__, 2__, 3__):
        
        __ https://github.com/plone/plone.app.theming/pull/38
        __ https://github.com/plone/plone.app.theming/pull/39
        __ https://github.com/plone/plone.app.theming/pull/40
        
        Once this plugin is included into your Plone site (e.g. including it into the
        buildout eggs list and running the buildout), the plugin is enabled for the
        theme by adding the following line into its ``manifest.cfg``:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
           [theme:genericsetup]
        
        By default the plugin looks the profile imported during activation from a theme
        sub-directory called ``install`` and the profile imported during deactivation
        from a sub-directory called ``uninstall``. The default lookup directories can
        be customized in ``manifest.cfg``:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
           [theme:genericsetup]
           install = my-install
           uninstall = my-uninstall
        
        The importable profile can be edited TTW through the theme editor:
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collective/collective.themesitesetup/master/docs/images/edit-site-setup.png
           :width: 768px
           :align: center
        
        **Note:** Because the theme editor hides all *dotfiles*, files starting with a
        dot must be renamed to end with ``.dotfile`` (and to not start with a dot).
        
        This plugin also provides a helper form for exporting the current site setup
        into a through-the-web created (editable) theme. The helper form can be reached
        by adding ``@@export-site-setup`` after the theme resource directory URL,
        e.g. ``http://localhost:8080/Plone/++theme++my-theme/@@export-site-setup``:
