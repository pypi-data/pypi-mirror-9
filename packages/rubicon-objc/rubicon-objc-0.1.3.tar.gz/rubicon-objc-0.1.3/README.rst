Rubicon-ObjC
============

Rubicon-ObjC is a bridge between Objective C and Python. It enables you to:

* Use Python to instantiate objects defined in Objective C,
* Use Python to invoke methods on objects defined in Objective C, and
* Subclass and extend Objective C classes in Python.

It also includes wrappers of the some key data types from the Core Foundation
framework (e.g., NSString).

Quickstart
----------

Rubicon uses a combination of `ctypes`, plus Objective-C's own reflection
APIs, to enable Objective C objects to be referenced in a Python process.

To install Rubicon, use pip::

    $ pip install rubicon-objc

Then, in a Python shell::

    >>> from ctypes import cdll
    >>> from ctypes import util
    >>> from rubicon.objc import ObjCClass, objc_method

    # Use ctypes to import a framework into the Python process
    >>> cdll.LoadLibrary(util.find_library('Foundation'))

    # Wrap an Objective C class contained in the framework
    >>> NSURL = ObjCClass("NSURL")

    # Then instantiate the Objective C class, using the API
    # that is exposed through Objective C. The Python method name
    # is the concatenated version of the Objective C method descriptor,
    # with colons replaced with underscores. So, the equivalent of
    # [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://pybee.org"];
    # would be:
    >>> NSURL.URLWithString_("http://pybee.org/")

    # To create a new Objective C class, define a Python class that
    # has the methods you want to define, decorated to provide the
    # Objective C prototype:
    >>> class Handler(NSObject):
    ...     @objc_method('@i')
    ...     def initWithValue_(self, value):
    ...         # You can't store attributes directly on the object -
    ...         # you need to put them manually on the Python object
    ...         self.__dict__['value'] = value
    ...         return self
    ...
    ...     @objc_method('vi')
    ...     def pokeWithValue_(self, value):
    ...         print ("Poking with", value)

    # Then use the class:
    >>> my_handler = Handler.alloc().initWithValue_(42)
    >>> my_handler.pokeWithValue_(37)

Testing
-------

To run the Rubicon test suite:

1. Compile the Rubicon test library. A ``Makefile`` has been provided to make
this easy. Type::

    $ make

to compile it.

.. admonition:: Cross platform support

    This Makefile currently only works under OS/X; however, the build commands
    aren't complicated; it should be fairly easy to reproduce the build on other
    platforms. Pull requests to make the ``Makefile`` cross-platform are welcome.

2. Put the Rubicon support library somewhere that it will be found by dynamic
   library discovery. This means:

   a. Under OS X, put the ``tests/objc`` directory in your ``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH``

   b. Under Linux, put the ``tests/objc`` directory in your ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``

   c. Under Windows.... something :-)


3. Run the test suite::

    $ python setup.py test

   A ``tox`` configuration has also been provided; to run the tests across all
   supported platforms, run::

    $ tox
