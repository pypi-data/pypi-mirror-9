Hi everyone,

I am introducing a new CI (continous integration) system, Tunir [1]. Tunir is a
CI which is simple to maintain  and can execute jobs in various kinds of
systems including cloud image based VM(s), bare metal system or Docker based
containers. To use the cloud based images, you do not need any working cloud,
it  will use your development system to boot a temporary cloud VM.

I have released 0.1 version of the system, it is currently completely command
line based (no UI). Tunir also has a stateless mode, that ensures you don't
need any database setup done to run a job. Siddhesh told me that you all
looking for a CI system to build and test glibc.

[2] and [3] is an example which tries to build glibc from a latest koji build.
[2] contains the image details, I am using the standard Fedora 21 cloud image,
which can be downloaded from [4].

Right now Docker based jobs count a job as "failed" if it contains anything on
stderr, if we know that would be the case, then we can mark a command with @@
in the beginning of the line as shown in [5]

I have already filed a review request [6], you can try out a Fedora 21 build
[7] already available in my fedorapeople space.

How to test/try?
----------------

Install the package, it should bring in the dependencies, also download a cloud
image[4] somewhere in your computer. Download [2] and [3] in the current
directory. You will have to start redis on your system first, we use that as an
external queue for available ports.

    $ sudo service redis start

Next add the default ports to the queue with the following command.

    $ python /usr/share/tunir/createports.py

Now, update glibc.json with the correct path to the cloud image in your local
system. Then you can fire the first job.

    $ sudo tunir --job glibc --stateless

[8] contains the example output of the job. Till few hours back it was failing
saying old version of make.

This is the initial stage of the project, we will improve detection of job
failures and other issues. It will be really great if you try the tool and give
your feedback.
