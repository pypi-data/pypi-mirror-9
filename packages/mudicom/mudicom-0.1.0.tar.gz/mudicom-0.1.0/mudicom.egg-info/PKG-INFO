Description: 
        mudicom
        =======
        
        A light-weight python package that validates, reads, and extracts images from a DICOM file.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Base:
        
        - Python <= 2.7 (Should work with Python 3 but I haven't tested it)
        - GDCM with python wrapper (http://mudicom.dcmdb.org/install.html)
        
        Validator:
        
        - dicom3tools (http://www.dclunie.com/dicom3tools.html)
        
        Image:
        
        - numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
        - PIL (https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow); or
        - Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/)
        
        Quick How To
        ------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import mudicom
            mu = mudicom.load("mudicom/tests/dicoms/ex1.dcm")
        
            # returns array of data elements as dicts
            mu.read()
        
            # returns dict of errors and warnings for DICOM
            mu.validate()
        
            # basic anonymization
            mu.anonymize()
            # save anonymization
            mu.save_as("dicom.dcm")
        
            # creates image object
            img = mu.image # before v0.1.0 this was mu.image()
            # returns numpy array
            img.numpy # before v0.1.0 this was mu.numpy()
        
            # using Pillow, saves DICOM image
            img.save_as_pil("ex1.jpg")
            # using matplotlib, saves DICOM image
            img.save_as_plt("ex1_2.jpg")

        Roadmap
        -------
        
        - Extract multiple images from one single DICOM file
        - Detect corrupted DICOM files
        - Ability to anonymize DICOM file
        - Ability to set data elements

        Special thanks to `Mathieu Malaterre`_ (primary developer for GDCM),
        of whom without this package would not be possible.
