Version 1.0.0
-------------

    - Replaced dash in the package name to underscore, as it seemed to confuse the package manager (python setup.py develop would fail on packages attempting to use intervaltree).
      Formally, it's a new package now. The package with the dash in the name had to be removed completely from PyPI 
    - Added the the possibility to specify an interval_maker in GenomeIntervalTree's methods from_bed and from_table.

Version 0.6
-------------

    - Extracted genome-related code into a separate package from https://github.com/konstantint/PyIntervalTree (version 0.5).
