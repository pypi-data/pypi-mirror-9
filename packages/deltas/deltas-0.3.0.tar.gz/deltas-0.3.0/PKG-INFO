Description: Deltas
        ======
        
        An open licensed (MIT) library for performing generating deltas (A.K.A sequences
        of operations) representing the difference between two sequences of comparable
        tokens.
        
        * **Installation:** **TODO**
        * **Repo**: `http://github.com/halfak/Deltas`_
        * **Documentation**: `http://pythonhosted.org/deltas/`_
        * Note this library requires Python 3.3 or newer
        
        This library is intended to be used to make experimental difference detection
        strategies more easily available.  There are currently two strategies available:
        
        ``deltas.sequence_matcher.diff(a, b)``:
            A shameless wrapper around `difflib.SequenceMatcher` to get it to work
            within the structure of *deltas*.
        ``deltas.segment_matcher.diff(a, b, segmenter=None)``:
            A generalized difference detector that is designed to detect block moves
            and copies based on the use of a ``Segmenter``.
        
        :Example:
            >>> from deltas import segment_matcher, text_split
            >>>
            >>> a = text_split.tokenize("This is some text.  This is some other text.")
            >>> b = text_split.tokenize("This is some other text.  This is some text.")
            >>> operations = segment_matcher.diff(a, b)
            >>>
            >>> for op in operations:
            ...     print(op.name, repr(''.join(a[op.a1:op.a2])), repr(''.join(b[op.b1:op.b2])))
            ...
            equal 'This is some other text.' 'This is some other text.'
            insert ' ' '  '
            equal 'This is some text.' 'This is some text.'
            delete '  ' ''
