**django-dynamic-forms** lets you create your forms through the Django admin.
You can add and remove form fields as you need them. That makes it perfect
for creating survey or application forms.

.. warning::

   **django-dynamic-forms** 0.4.x will be the latest version branch that
   supports Django < 1.7!


INSTALLATION
============

Add ``'dynamic_forms'`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'dynamic_forms',
        ...
    )

Add ``'dynamic_forms.middlewares.FormModelMiddleware'`` to the
``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` (probably at the end)::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        ...
        'dynamic_forms.middlewares.FormModelMiddleware'
    )

Add ``'dynamic_forms.urls'`` to the URL patterns::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^dynamic_forms/',
            include('dynamic_forms.urls', namespace='dynamic_forms')),
        ...
    )

.. important::

   Make sure that you get the namespace straight: ``dynamic_forms``!


You can set ``DYNAMIC_FORMS_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS`` in your settings to a list of
e-mail addresses. Forms being send via e-mail will then be send to those
addresses instead of those defined in ``settings.ADMINS``. Each recipient will
see *all* other recipients. See `send_mail
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/email/#django.core.mail.send_mail>`_
in the officiall documentation.
