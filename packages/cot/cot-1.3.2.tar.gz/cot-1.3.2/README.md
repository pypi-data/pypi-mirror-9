COT (the Common OVF Tool) is a tool for editing
[Open Virtualization Format](http://dmtf.org/standards/ovf)
(`.ovf`, `.ova`) virtual appliances, with a focus on virtualized network
appliances such as the [Cisco CSR 1000V](http://www.cisco.com/go/csr1000v)
and [Cisco IOS XRv](http://www.cisco.com/go/iosxrv) platforms.

COT's capabilities include:

* Add a disk or other file to an OVF/OVA
* Edit OVF hardware information (CPUs, RAM, NICs, configuration profiles, etc.)
* Edit product description information in an OVF/OVA
* Edit OVF environment properties
* Display a descriptive summary of the contents of an OVA or OVF package
* Embed a bootstrap configuration text file into an OVF/OVA.
* Deploy an OVF/OVA to an ESXi (VMware vSphere or vCenter) server to provision
  a new virtual machine (VM).
