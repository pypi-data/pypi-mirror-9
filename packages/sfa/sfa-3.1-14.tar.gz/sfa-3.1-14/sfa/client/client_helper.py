#
# it seems terribly wrong that the client should decide to use PG- or PL- related code
# esp. in a context where we're trying to have more and more kinds of testbeds involved
#
# also, the 'users' field that CreateSliver is expecting (the key point here is to get this right)
# is specified to have at least a urn and a list of keys, both of these being supported natively
# in the sfa db
# So long story short, it seems to me that we should have a common code that fills in 'urn' and 'keys'
# and then code that tentatively tries to add as much extra info that we can get on these users
#
# the fact e.g. that PlanetLab insists on getting a first_name and last_name is not
# exactly consistent with the GENI spec. of CreateSliver
