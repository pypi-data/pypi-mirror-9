########## this class takes care of database upgrades
### upgrade from a pre-2.1 db 
# * 1.0 and up to 1.1-4:  ('very old')    
#       was piggybacking the planetlab5 database
#       this is kind of out of our scope here, we don't have the credentials 
#       to connect to planetlab5, but this is documented in
#       https://svn.planet-lab.org/wiki/SFATutorialConfigureSFA#Upgradingnotes
#       and essentially this is seamless to users
# * from 1.1-5 up to 2.0-x: ('old')
#       uses the 'sfa' db and essentially the 'records' table,
#       as well as record_types
#       together with an 'sfa_db_version' table (version, subversion)
# * from 2.1:
#       we have an 'records' table, plus 'users' and the like
#       and once migrate has kicked in there is a table named (see migrate.cfg)
#       migrate_db_version (repository_id, repository_path, version)
### after 2.1 
#       Starting with 2.1, we use sqlalchemy-migrate scripts in a standard way
#       Note that the model defined in sfa.storage.model needs to be maintained 
#       as the 'current/latest' version, and newly installed deployments will 
#       then 'jump' to the latest version number without going through the migrations
###
# An initial attempt to run this as a 001_*.py migrate script 
# did not quite work out (essentially we need to set the current version
# number out of the migrations logic)
# also this approach has less stuff in the initscript, which seems just right
