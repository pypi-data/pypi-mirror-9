Description: <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>This software implements a wrapper for the SFA (Slice-based Federation
        Architecture) that allows networking testbeds to interoperate in terms
        of exposing and provisioning resources. It comes with drivers for
        a few testbeds, notably PlanetLab and IotLab.</p>
