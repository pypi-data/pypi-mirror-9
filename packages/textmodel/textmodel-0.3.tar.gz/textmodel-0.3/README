0. INTRO
========

Textmodel is a datatype which can hold textstrings together with
format information. It is similar to GtkTextBuffer in functionality,
but it is completely independent of a gui-toolkit.

Wxtextview is an example widget written for the wx toolkit. It has the
basic functionality of a text editor. It is developed and tested
mainly on windows, however it seems to work on linux and mac as well.

Textmodel and wxtextview are experimental. They are neither bug free
nor stable.  Wxtextview lacks the configurability which you might
expect from a real text widget. Hack it to fit your needs.

With release 0.2 two demos were added which show the more advanced 
possibilities of textmodel:

:notebook.py:

 A mathematica-like notebook interface for python

:math_demo.py:
 
 A demonstration of typesetting mathematics


1. USAGE
========


Running the demos:
------------------

Just cd to the demo directory and execute the scripts. No installation
is needed. External dependencies are wxpython (all demos) and
matplotlib (notebook). The demos were tested on linux, windows and mac
platforms.

::

    $ cd demo/
    $ python demo1.py

Using textmodel:
----------------

::

    from textmodel import TextModel, defaultstyle
    
    text = TextModel(u'Hello World!')

    # highlight the word "World"
    text.set_properties(6, 11, bgcolor = 'yellow')

    # query the color
    print text.get_style(0)['bgcolor'] # --> color of first character
    print text.get_style(10)['bgcolor'] # --> color of 10th character



Using the wxtextview-widget:
----------------------------

::

    from textmodel import TextModel
    from wxtextview import WXTextView

    import wx
    app = wx.App()


    model = TextModel(u'Hello World!')
    model.set_properties(6, 11, fontsize=14)
    model.set_properties(6, 11, bgcolor='yellow')

    # display the texmodel in a view 
    frame = wx.Frame(None)
    view = WXTextView(frame, -1)
    view.model = model
    frame.Show()

    # set cursor and selection
    view.cursor = 5
    view.selection = 0, 5

    # display the same textmodel in a second view
    frame2 = wx.Frame(None)
    view2 = WXTextView(frame2, -1)
    view2.model = model
    frame2.Show()

    app.MainLoop()
