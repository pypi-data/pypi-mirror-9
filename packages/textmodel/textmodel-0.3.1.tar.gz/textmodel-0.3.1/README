0. INTRO
========

Textmodel is a data type which can hold textstrings together with
format information. It is similar to GtkTextBuffer in functionality,
but it is completely independent of a gui-toolkit. TextModel is based
on a efficient b-tree like structure and is incredibly fast.

Wxtextview is an example widget written for the wx toolkit. It has the
functionality of a rich text editor and can handle even very long
texts without feeling slow.

There are two demos showing advanced possibilities of textmodel:

:notebook.py:

 A notebook interface similar to ipython

:math_demo.py:
 
 A demonstration of typesetting math


1. USAGE
========


Running the demos:
------------------

Just cd to the demo directory and execute the scripts. No installation
is needed. External dependencies are wxpython (all demos) and
matplotlib (notebook). The demos were tested on linux, windows and mac
platforms.

::

    $ cd demo/
    $ python demo1.py

Using textmodel:
----------------

::

    from textmodel import TextModel
    
    text = TextModel(u'Hello World!')

    # highlight the word "World"
    text.set_properties(6, 11, bgcolor = 'yellow')

    # query the color
    print text.get_style(0)['bgcolor'] # --> color of first character
    print text.get_style(10)['bgcolor'] # --> color of 10th character



Using the wxtextview-widget:
----------------------------

::

    from textmodel import TextModel
    from wxtextview import WXTextView

    import wx
    app = wx.App()


    model = TextModel(u'Hello World!')
    model.set_properties(6, 11, fontsize=14)
    model.set_properties(6, 11, bgcolor='yellow')

    # display the texmodel in a view 
    frame = wx.Frame(None)
    view = WXTextView(frame, -1)
    view.model = model
    frame.Show()

    # set cursor and selection
    view.index = 5
    view.selection = 0, 5

    # display the same textmodel in a second view
    frame2 = wx.Frame(None)
    view2 = WXTextView(frame2, -1)
    view2.model = model
    frame2.Show()

    app.MainLoop()
