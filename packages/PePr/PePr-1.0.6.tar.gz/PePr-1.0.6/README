INTRODUCTION
============
PePr is a ChIP-Seq Peak-calling and Prioritization pipeline 
that uses a sliding window approach and models read counts across 
replicates and between groups with a negative binomial distribution. 
PePr empirically estimates the optimal shift/fragment size and 
sliding window width, and estimates dispersion from the local genomic
area. Regions with less variability across replicates are ranked more
favorably than regions with greater variability. Optional 
post-processing steps are also made available to filter out peaks
not exhibiting the expected shift size and/or to narrow the width of peaks.


INSTALL
=======
if you want to use pip to install PePr(recommended): 
    if pip package is intalled in your system:
        simply run `pip install PePr`
    else:
        install pip and then run `pip intall PePr`
else if you don't want to use pip (going the harder way): 
    manually download and install the dependencies if not already 
    installed(numpy, scipy and pysam); download PePr and unzip 
    (tar zxvf PePr-version.tar.gz); go into the PePr directory and
    type `python setup.py install`.

You can test the intallation by running the example code in the 
PePr/data directory to see if it gives the same results as provided.
