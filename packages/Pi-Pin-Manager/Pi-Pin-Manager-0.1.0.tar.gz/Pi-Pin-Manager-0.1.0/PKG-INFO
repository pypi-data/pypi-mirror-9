        ==============
        
        Boilerplate code is annoying and sometimes there can be a lot of it working with Raspberry Pi
        GPIO (RPi.GPIO). I got tired of setting the board mode and declaring GPIO channels in every
        script so I made a library that uses a config file instead. In addition to getting rid of the
        boilerplate, **Pi-Pin-Manager** has the added benefit of pulling the configuration out of the
        code. This means you can modify any pin's behavior without ever touching a Python file or
        having to redeploy your program.
