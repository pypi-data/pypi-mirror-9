Description: Brightway2 parameters
        =====================
        
        Library for storing, validating, and calculating with parameters. Designed to work with the Brightway2 life cycle assessment framework, but should work for other use cases.
        
        Compatible with Python 2 & 3.
        
        Approach:
        
        - Parameters are defined in a dataset: ds['parameters']
        - No global parameters
        - No inheritance between datasets
        
        Data format:
        - ds['parameters'] is a list of parameters
        - 'name' field (must be unique)
            - 'name' can be generated automatically on import
            - 'name' can't copy function names (long list)
        - optional 'formula' field
        - 'formula' must use numpy (i.e. array) compatible functions
        - Parameters have normal uncertainty fields
        - An exchange can reference a parameter name (but not a formula)
            - No uncertainty if referencing a parameter
        
        Processing:
        
        - ParameterSet object
            - New asteval instance for each parameter set
        - Need to get order of parameters to be processed
        - MC needs an efficient way to insert values into various RNG output arrays
            - Do we need a new unique ID per exchange? Exchange input/output not guaranteed unique
            - Or somehow do something tricky during processing step?
            - Rewrite main MonteCarlo class to have view into PV lca?
