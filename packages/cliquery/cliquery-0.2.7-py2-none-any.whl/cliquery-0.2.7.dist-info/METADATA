# CLIQuery

## a command line search engine and browsing tool
CLIQuery is an intermediary tool between the command line and any GUI based browser. It supports searching, browsing, bookmarking, and previewing webpages through a mix of command line output and browser invocation. It is **_NOT_** a command line browser (if that's what you are searching for, search for Lynx instead)!

The results? Less clicking, faster results, and *no limitations to normal browsing!*

## Installation
* `pip install cliquery`
* [Sign up](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html) for a WolframAlpha API key.
* Enter your API key and choice of browser in .cliqrc (cygwin users should enter `cygwin` as their browser). An example .rc file is available in cliquery/.cliqrc, or will be after the first run.

## Usage
usage: cliquery.py [-h] [-s] [-f] [-o] [-w] [-d] [-b] [-v] [QUERY [QUERY ...]]

a command line search engine and browsing tool

  positional arguments:
    QUERY           keywords to search

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help      show this help message and exit
    -s, --search    display search links
    -f, --first     open first link
    -o, --open      open link manually
    -w, --wolfram   display wolfram results
    -d, --describe  display page snippet
    -b, --bookmark  view and modify bookmarks
    -v, --version   display current version

## Notes
* A search may return immediate results, such as calculations or facts, or instead a page of search results comprised of descriptive links to follow.

* Interactive use is as easy as passing the regular flag arguments into the link prompt; this overrides any preexisting flags and allows for more even more flexibility

* To choose multiple links at once, a range may be specified by separating the start and end range with a dash. Leaving one end of the range blank will choose all links until the other end of that range. For example, given 10 links, entering 5- would effectively be the same as entering 5-10.

* Using the bookmarks flag with empty arguments will list all current bookmarks in .cliqrc, ordered by time of entry. To add a new bookmark, simply enter the url you wish to add as an argument. To open an existing bookmark, enter the corresponding bookmark number as listed as an argument. Bookmarks may also be added interactively through the link prompt like all other flags.
