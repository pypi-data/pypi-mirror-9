Description: 
              Prestans is a REST micro-framework built right on top of WSGI, designed 
              perform and co-exists with other middleware and frameworks that you employ. 
              Our target audience are developers building large REST backends for use 
              with pure Ajax (using a framework like Google Closure) or mobile applications. 
              Prestans is designed for you to "take as much or as little" you like, 
              although we do think that it all works really well together.
        
              Reasons we think you will love Prestans:
        
              - Built right on top of WSGI, designed ground up to cooperate with other frameworks
              - Strong representative of REST philosophies leveraging HTTP headers and verbs
              - Support for multiple dialects, including formalised patterns for binary content 
              - Handlers maps HTTP verbs to implemented class methods, complimented  with custom 
                request parser and response writer (built on top of WebOb)
              - Unforgivingly strict parsing of requests and responses to ensure data integrity
              - Helper methods to ease transformation of persistent objects to REST responses
              - Pluggable integration to authentication
