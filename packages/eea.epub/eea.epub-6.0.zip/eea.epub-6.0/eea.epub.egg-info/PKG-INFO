        Introduction
        ============
        
        EEA Epub product allows you to import in Plone epub files. On upload,
        Epub content will imported as Plone folders, files, images and documents.
        
        Export to Epub is also available.
        
        As of version 4.3 epub files created with **Adobe InDesign CS4** and **Sigil**
        are tested and known to work with this package, previous versions of this
        package only supported epubs created with InDesign.
        
        
        Main features
        =============
        
        EEA Epub features:
        
        1. Imports epub files as Plone content.
        2. Stores the original epub in the main folder for easy retrieval.
        3. Exports the Plone content back into an epub.
        4. Clean filename as you import the epub and they contain characters that
           wouldn't be allowed as a Plone id.
           This behaviour is on by default but it can be disabled by unchecking
           the boolean flag at portal_properties/site_properties
           **clean_epub_file_names**.
           If you find that the Document Pages added by the Epub process has broken
           links try to re-upload without this boolean flag.
        5. Possibility to temporarily disable dynamic ePub creation by adding an item
           called 'action-download-epub' within context
        6. Asynchronously generate ePub files and notify users by email
           when ePub is ready
        
        
        Epub compatibility
        ==================
        
        EEA Epub makes the following assumptions about the loaded epub:
        
        1. You don't use unicode or other special characters into the name
           of the epub, images or links
        2. You've created the epub with "Adobe InDesign CS4" or "Sigil" which uses
           some standards for the following:
        
           * The table of contents is named toc.ncx and is placed inside OEBPS
           * Book text & images are placed inside the folder OEBPS or other folders
             that are children of OEBPS
           * Items ids doesn't contain the following characters . / \ ( if
             possible stick to letters, numbers and - _ )
        
        Best practices when creating an epub:
        
        1. Chapter names should not be all uppercase or use special characters
        2. Image names should not contain spaces, periods, / or other special characters
        
        
        Debugging
        =========
        
        At this moment any errors that would appear on the site are surpressed
        with a info message.
        
        If you want to see the detailed error check the Plone instance log usually
        found in buildout-folder/var/log.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to get eea.epub support in Plone 4 using this
        package is to work with installations based on `zc.buildout`_.
        Other types of installations should also be possible, but might turn out
        to be somewhat tricky.
        
        To get started you will simply need to add the package to your **eggs** and
        **zcml** sections, run buildout, restart your Plone instance and install the
        **eea.epub** package using the quick-installer or via the "Add-on
        Products" section in "Site Setup"::
        
            [instance]
            eggs =
                eea.epub
        
            zcml =
                eea.epub
        
        You can download a sample buildout at:
        
        https://github.com/eea/eea.epub/tree/master/buildouts/plone4
        
        Asynchronous setup
        ------------------
        By default all ePubs are **NOT** generated asynchronous. You'll need `eea.pdf`_
        installed in order to be able to enable asynchronous download or you can
        provide an os environment called **EEACONVERTER_ASYNC**.
        
        Also some extra config is needed within your buildout in order for this
        to work properly.
        
        First of all you'll need a folder were to store generated ePub files. For this
        you can create it manually within buildout:directory/var/ or
        you can let buildout handle it::
        
            [buildout]
        
            parts +=
                media-downloads
                media-downloads-temp
        
            media-downloads-path = ${buildout:directory}/var/downloads/pdf
            media-downloads-temp = ${buildout:directory}/var/downloads/tmp
        
            [media-downloads]
            recipe = ore.recipe.fs:mkdir
            path = ${buildout:media-downloads-path}
            mode = 0700
            createpath = true
        
            [media-downloads-temp]
            recipe = ore.recipe.fs:mkdir
            path = ${buildout:media-downloads-temp}
            mode = 0700
            createpath = true
        
        This will create a folder named **downloads** within buildout:directory/var/
        
        Next, in order for this folder to be visible from your website and your users to
        be able to download generated ePubs you'll need to tell to your zope instances
        about it::
        
            [buildout]
        
            media-downloads-name = downloads
            media-downloads-path = ${buildout:directory}/var/downloads/pdf
            media-downloads-temp = ${buildout:directory}/var/downloads/tmp
        
            [instance]
        
            environment-vars +=
              EEADOWNLOADS_NAME ${buildout:media-downloads-name}
              EEADOWNLOADS_PATH ${buildout:media-downloads-path}
              EEACONVERTER_TEMP ${buildout:media-downloads-temp}
              EEACONVERTER_ASYNC True
        
        Also, don't forget to setup `plone.app.async`_
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                plone.app.async
            zcml +=
                plone.app.async-single_db_worker
        
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        Import
        ------
        From "Add new" menu select "EpubFile" and upload an epub file.
        
        Export
        ------
        Go to Home page and click on download as ePub icon at the bottom of the page
         or directly access http://localhost:8080/Plone/front-page/download.epub
        
        
        Custom permissions
        ==================
        Custom permissions added by this package
        
        Can download ePub (eea.epub.download)
        -------------------------------------
        Assign this permission to roles that you want to be able to download content as ePub
        Default: Owner, Manager, Editor
        
        Can customize ePub (eea.epub.customize)
        ---------------------------------------
        Assign this permission to roles that you want to be able to contextually customize
        the output ePub look and feel
        Default: Manager, Site Administrator
        
        Content rules
        =============
        This package uses Plone Content-rules to notify users by email when an asynchronous
        ePub job is done. Thus 3 custom content-rules will be added within
        Plone > Site Setup > Content-rules
        
        .. warning ::
        
          As these content-rules are triggered by an asynchronous job, while
          you customize the email template for these content-rules,
          please **DO NOT USE OTHER** string substitutions **that the ones** that start
          with **$download_** as you'll break the download chain.
          Also if you disable these content-rules the users will never know when the
          ePub is ready and what is the link where they can download the output ePub.
        
        ePub export succeeded
        ---------------------
        Notify the person who requested a ePub export that the ePub successfully exported
        and provide a link to the downloadable ePub
        
        ePub export failed
        ------------------
        Notify the person who requested a ePub export that the ePub export failed.
        
        ePub export failed (admin)
        --------------------------
        Notify admin that there were issues while exporting ePub
        
        
        Content rules email string substitution
        =======================================
        In order to be able to easily customize emails sent by this package the following
        custom email template string substitutions can be made
        
        
        ${download_came_from_url}
        -------------------------
        The absolute URL of the Plone object which is downloaded as ePub
        
        ${download_email}
        -----------------
        Email address of the user that triggered the download as ePub action
        
        ${download_error}
        -----------------
        Error traceback when download as ePub job fails
        
        ${download_from_email}
        ----------------------
        Site Admin email address customizable via Plone > Site Setup > Mail
        
        ${download_from_name}
        ---------------------
        Site Admin name customizable via Plone > Site Setup > Mail
        
        ${download_title}
        -----------------
        Title of the Plone object which is downloaded as ePub
        
        ${download_url}
        ---------------
        The absolute URL where the generated output ePub can be downloaded
        
        ${download_type}
        ----------------
        Download type. Default to EPUB for this package. It is package specific and it
        can be EPUB, PDF, etc.
        
        
        Disable ePub export
        ===================
        You have the possibility to temporarily disable dynamic ePub export contextually
        by adding a static ePub file (or a Python Script, Page Template, etc)
        within context called **action-download-epub**. This way /download.epub will
        return this file instead of generating one based on context data.
        
        .. note::
        
          This works only with folderish items.
        
        Content rules
        =============
        This package uses Plone Content-rules to notify users by email when
        an asynchronous ePub job is done. Thus 3 custom content-rules will be added
        within Plone > Site Setup > Content-rules
        
        .. warning ::
        
          As these content-rules are triggered by an asynchronous job, while
          you customize the email template for these content-rules,
          please **DO NOT USE OTHER** string substitutions **that the ones** that start
          with **$download_** as you'll break the download chain.
          Also if you disable these content-rules the users will never know when the
          ePub is ready and what is the link where they can download the output ePub.
