:note: BioServices is tested for Python 2.7, 3.3. . Version 3 is currently failing
    due to a gevent dependencies, which should be fixed soon. Although 
    the building icon may be red, 99 of the tests pass. Failure are usually due 
    to a service being temporary down.

**Bioservices** is a Python package that provides access to many Bioinformatices Web Services (e.g.,
UniProt) and a framework to easily implement Web Services wrappers (based on 
WSDL/SOAP or REST protocols).

The primary goal of **BioServices** is to use Python as a glue language to provide
a programmatic access to several Bioinformatics Web Services. By doing so, elaboration of  new
applications that combine several of the wrapped Web Services is fostered.

One of the main philosophy of **BioServices** is to make use of the existing
biological databases (not to re-invent new databases) and to alleviates the
needs for expertise in Web Services for the developers/users.

BioServices provides access to 25 Web Services including. For a quick start,
look at some notebooks related to 

* UniProt on `uniprot nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/pythonhosted.org//bioservices/_downloads/UniProt.ipynb>`_
* BioModels on `biomodels nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/pythonhosted.org//bioservices/_downloads/BioModels.ipynb>`_
* ChEMBL on `chembl nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/pythonhosted.org//bioservices/_downloads/ChEMBL.ipynb>`_
* Ensembl on `Ensembl nbviewer <https://github.com/bioservices/notebooks/tree/master/ensembl>`_
* KEGG on `KEGG nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/pythonhosted.org/bioservices/_downloads/KEGG.ipynb>`_
* MUSCLE on `MUSCLE  nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/pythonhosted.org/bioservices/_downloads/MUSCLE.ipynb>`_
* NCBIBlast on `ncbiblast nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/pythonhosted.org/bioservices/_downloads/NCBIBlast.ipynb>`_
* WikiPathway on `wikipathway nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/pythonhosted.org/bioservices/_downloads/WikiPathway.ipynb>`_

and more on `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cokelaer/bioservices/tree/master/doc/source/notebook/>`_.

An up-to-date list of Web Services is provided within 
the online `documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/bioservices/>`_.

Here is a small example using the UniProt Web Service to search for the zap70 specy in human
organism::

    >>> from bioservices import UniProt
    >>> u = UniProt(verbose=False)
    >>> data = u.search("zap70+and+taxonomy:9606", format="tab", limit=3, 
    ...                 columns="entry name,length,id, genes")
    >>> print(data)
    Entry name   Length  Entry   Gene names
    ZAP70_HUMAN  619     P43403  ZAP70 SRK
    B4E0E2_HUMAN 185     B4E0E2
    RHOH_HUMAN   191     Q15669  RHOH ARHH TTF
