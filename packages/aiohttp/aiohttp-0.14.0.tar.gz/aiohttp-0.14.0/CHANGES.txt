CHANGES
=======

0.14.0 (Unreleased)
-------------------

- HttpMessage._add_default_headers does not overwrite existing headers #216

- Expose multidict classes at package level

- add `aiohttp.web.WebSocketResponse`

- According to RFC 6455 websocket subprotocol preference order is
  provided by client, not by server

- websocket's ping and pong accept optional message parameter

- multidict views do not accept `getall` parameter anymore, it
  returns the full body anyway.

- multidicts have optional Cython optimization, cythonized version of multidicts is
  about 5 times faster than pure Python.

- multidict.getall() returns `list`, not `tuple`.

- Backward imcompatible change: now there are two mutable multidicts
  (`MultiDict`, `CIMultiDict`) and two immutable multidict proxies
  (`MultiDictProxy` and `CIMultiDictProxy`). Previous edition of
  multidicts was not a part of public API BTW.

- Router refactoring to push Not Allowed and Not Found in middleware processing

- Convert `ConnectionError` to `aiohttp.DisconnectedError` and don't
  eat `ConnectionError` exceptions from web handlers.

- Remove hop headers from Response class, wsgi response still uses hop headers.

- Allow to send raw chunked encoded response.

- Allow to encode output bytes stream into chunked encoding.

- Allow to compress output bytes stream with `deflate` encoding.

- Server has 75 seconds keepalive timeout now, was non-keepalive by default.

- Request is inherited from dict now for making per-request storage to
  middlewares (#242).
