        This is a very simple package to integrate the Content Delivery Network (CDN) CloudFlare into the ability to do cache purging
        with plone.app.caching. 
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        - Install "CloudFlare Cache Purging" addon
        - Go to "Caching" control panel and make sure "Enable purging" is checked
          in the "Caching proxies" tab.
        - Make sure to also configure which content types to enable purging on and
          make sure to check if you are using virtual host urls
        - Go to the "CloudFlare" control panel and fill in settings
        - Make test purge requests
