python-vipaccess

python-vipaccess is a free and open source software (FOSS)
implementation of Symantec's VIP Access client. It is able to generate
OATH URIs and their corresponding QR codes so any TOTP-generating
application can be used as a VIP OTP token.

Right now, it only supports the bare minimum number of features of the
VIP Access provisioning protocol to work, but I might add support for
the other features at some point in the future.

You can see my original blog post
`here <http://www.cyrozap.com/2014/09/29/reversing-the-symantec-vip-access-provisioning-protocol/>`__,
in which I describe how I reverse-engineered the VIP Access application.
