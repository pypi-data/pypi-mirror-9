Description: ========================
        Pyramid Method Rewriting
        ========================
        
        The ``pyramid_methodrewrite`` package is a pyramid plugin that adds a
        "tween" that rewrites the active HTTP method (as exposed via
        ``request.method``) to the value provided in a HTTP header or
        query-string. The main reason for this is to allow clients to fake the
        use of HTTP methods beyond GET and POST (such as PUT and DELETE) that
        are behind non-compliant proxies, browsers, or other deficient
        software that limit which HTTP methods can be sent.
        
        It does this by looking for an ``X-HTTP-Method-Override`` HTTP header
        or a ``_method`` parameter in either the query-string or POST data,
        and if the value is of the known set of HTTP methods, will override
        the active request's ``.method`` attribute. Both the header name and
        parameter name are configurable. The header value, if specified, takes
        precedence over the parameter value.
        
        For example, the request:
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
          GET /path/to/resource?_method=OPTIONS HTTP/1.1
        
        Becomes equivalent (from the application's point of view) to:
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
          OPTIONS /path/to/resource HTTP/1.1

        Installation
        ============
        
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          $ pip install pyramid-methodrewrite
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Enable the tween either in your INI file via:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
          pyramid.includes = pyramid_methodrewrite
        
        or in code in your package's application initialization via:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          def main(global_config, **settings):
            # ...
            config.include('pyramid_methodrewrite')
            # ...
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The following configuration settings can be set in your application's
        ``main`` section:
        
        * `methodrewrite.enabled`: a boolean flag to control whether or not
          method rewriting should be enabled. Default: ``True``.
        
        * `methodrewrite.on`: a list of incoming HTTP methods that will cause
          this tween to check the request parameters and potentially make the
          change. Defaults to ``(GET, POST)``.
        
        * `methodrewrite.header`: the name of the header that controls the
          requested method. Defaults to ``X-HTTP-Method-Override``. If
          present, the header override takes precedence over the parameter
          override.
        
        * `methodrewrite.param`: the name of the parameter that controls the
          requested method. Defaults to ``_method``.
        
        * `methodrewrite.to`: list of acceptable HTTP methods that a request
          can be rewritten to. If set to empty, no restrictions will be made
          on mapping to acceptable or known methods. Defaults to
          ``pyramid_methodrewrite.HTTP_METHODS``.
        
        Note that all method names are always converted to upper case.
