    Root/zero finding can be tempramental.  Small `dx`, `p`=1,  and large
    `max_iter` will probably find the roots/zeros but it may take some time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable f(x, *args)
        A function that takes at least one argument.
    args : tuple, optional
        Any extra arguments to `func`. Default args=().
    n : float, optional
        Number of roots to find, Default n=1.
    x0 : float, optional
        An x value less than the first root. This is NOT the initial guess of
        fsolve! Default x0=0.001.
    dx : float, optional
        Initial interval length to check for root in. Default dx=0.001.
    p : float, optional
        Factor to increase dx by up untill first root is found. Default p=1.0.
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum iterations when searching for an interval containing a root.
        Default max_iter=2000.  Note this is not the same as fsolve
        maxfev keword argument.
    atol, rtol : float, optional
        numpy.allclose parameters.  Used for checking if found the
        same root. Default atol=1e-8, rtol=1e-5.
    debug : True/False, optional
        Print calculations to stdout. Default debug=False
    fsolve_kwargs : dict, optional
        dict of kwargs to pass to scipy.optimize.fsolve.
        Default fsolve_kwargs={}.


    Returns
    -------
    roots : 1d ndarray
        Array of len n containing the first n roots of `func`.

    Notes
    -----
    Here is approximately what happens:

     - `func` is evaluated with `x0` and `args` to give y0
     - x is incremented by dx to give x1
     - `func` is evaluated with `x1` and `args` to give y1
     - If y0 and y1 have the same sign then there is no root between x0 and x1.
     - `dx` is multiplied by `p` and the x is incremented again.
     - successive intevals are checked until y0 and y1 are of different sign
       indicating that there is a root somewhere between x0 and x1.
     - `scipy.optimize.fsolve` is used to find the root. If it is the first
       root then the the left end of the interval, the current x0, is used as
       the initial guess for fsolve.  If it is a later root then the guess
       for fsolve is the x-axis intercept of the straight line joining
       (x0, y0) and (x1, y1).
     - Once a root is found, the search begins for the next root which starts
       between the root and the current x1. The
       current dx value, the one that contained the root is reduced by a fifth
       and off we go again.

    There are a few checks:

     - At least five intervals must be checked before a possible root
         interval is found.  If less than five occur then we go back to the
         starting point of that roots search and use a reduced dx.
     - There is a maximum limit to the number of iterations used for each root
     - It is possible that the algorithm will, when searching for succesive
       roots, find identical roots.  This is wrong.  The current interval size
       along with the current dx will be reduced and the search will continue.
       If the same root is found five times then the root finding parameters
       are inappropriate and an error message will be raised.
