2015-01-30 geotecha-0.1.2 Release.  Similar release to 0.1.1 but with
           with important changes to docs.  Added sphinx extensions
           gen_api_rst_files.py and gen_examples_rst_files.py which
           auto generate the api rst files and the example docs when
           I make the docs with 'make html'.  Now I gan just add
           example files and have them appear in the docs.

2015-01-14 geotecha-0.1.1 Release.  This is the version that works on
           Rohan's computer based on pythonxy-2.7.6.1.  I anticipate 
           some missing requirements in setup.py.  Also I have used
           'python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32' when building
           the extensions etc.  I think later versions of pythonxy
           do not have mingw so I'll adjust accordingly.
