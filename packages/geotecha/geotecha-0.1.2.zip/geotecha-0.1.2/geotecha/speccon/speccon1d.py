    """Calculate E and theta parts and assemble E_Igamv_the matrix that arises
    from homogenising a(Z)*D[u(Z, t), t] for non_zero top and bottom boundary
    conditions.

    When accounting for non-zero boundary conditions we homogenise the
    governing equation by letting u(Z,t) = v(Z,t) + utop(t)*(1-Z) + ubot(t)*Z
    and solving for v(Z, t).  This function calculates the time dependent
    E part, the depth dependent theta part, and then assembles
    E*inverse(gam*v)*theta which forms part of solution
    v(Z,t)=phi*v*E*inverse(gam*v)*theta.  The E and theta parts arise
    by subbing the boundary conditions into into governing equation terms of
    the form a(z)*D[u(Z,t), t].

    The contribution of each `mag_vs_time`-`omega_phase` pairing
    are superposed.    The result is an array
    of size (neig, len(tvals)). So each column is the are the column vector
    E*inverse(gam*v)*theta calculated at each output time.  This will allow
    us later to do v(Z,t) = phi*v*E_Igamv_the.

    Uses sin(m*z) in the calculation of theta.

    Parameters
    ----------
    drn : [0,1]
        Drainage condition,
        drn=0 for Pervious top pervious bottom (PTPB).
        drn=1 for Pervious top impoervious bottom (PTIB).
    m : ``list`` of ``float``
        Eigenvalues of BVP, the m in sin(m*Z). Generate with
        geotecha.speccon.m_from_sin_mx.
    eigs : 1d numpy.ndarray
        List of eigenvalues of the spectral matrix i.e. Eigenvalues of the
        square Igam_psi matrix.
    tvals : 1d numpy.ndarray`
        List of time values to evaluate E matrix at.
    Igamv : ndarray
        Speccon matrix.  Igamv = inverse of [gam * v])
    a : PolyLine
        Piewcewise linear function.  e.g. for 1d consolidation surcharge
        loading term is mv*D[sigma(z, t), t] so `a` would be mv.
    top_vs_time, bot_vs_time : list of PolyLine
        Piecewise linear magnitude vs time for the top and bottom boundary.
        Use ``None`` if there is no variation.
    top_omega_phase, bot_omega_phase : list of 2 element tuples, optional
        (omega, phase) for use in cos(omega * t + phase) * mag_vs_time
        if omega_phase is None then mag_vs_time will not be multiplied by a
        cosine.  If any element of omega_phase is None then in that particular
        loading combo, mag_vs_time will not be multiplied by a cosine.
    dT : ``float``, optional
        Time factor multiple for numerical convieniece. Default dT=1.0.
    theta_zero_indexes : slice/list etc., optional
        A slice object, list, etc that can be used for numpy fancy indexing.
        Any specified index of the theta vector will be set to zero.  This is
        useful when using the spectral method with block matrices and the
        loading term only refers to a subset of the equations.  When using
        block matrices m should be the same size as the block matrix.
        Default theta_zero_indexes=None i.e. no elements of theta will be
        set to zero.

    Returns
    -------
    E_Igamv_the : ndarray
        Loading matrix of size (neig, len(tvals)).

    Notes
    -----
    Assuming the loads are formulated as the product of separate time and depth
    dependant functions as well as a cyclic component:

    .. math:: \\sigma\\left({Z,t}\\right)=
                \\sigma\\left({Z}\\right)
                \\sigma\\left({t}\\right)
                \\cos\\left(\\omega t + \\phi\\right)

    the solution to the consolidation equation using the spectral method has
    the form:

    .. math:: u\\left(Z,t\\right)=
                \\mathbf{\\phi v E}
                \\left(\\mathbf{\\Gamma v}\\right)^{-1}
                \\mathbf{\\theta}


    When we consider non-zero boundary conditions, additional loading terms are
    created when we sub in the following into the original governing equation.

    .. math:: u\\left({Z,t}\\right)=
                v\\left({Z,t}\\right) +
                u_{top}\\left({t}\\right)\\left({1-Z}\\right) +
                u_{bot}\\left({b}\\right)Z

    Two additional loading terms are created with each substitution, one
    for the top boundary condition and one for the bottom boundary condition.

    This function calculates :math:`\\mathbf{E}\\left(\\mathbf{\\Gamma v}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{\\theta}`
    when substitutions are made in terms of the following form:


    .. math:: a\\left({Z}\\right)\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}

    It is assumed that :math:`u_{top}\\left({t}\\right)` and
    :math:`u_{bot}\\left({t}\\right)` are piecewise linear
    in time with a cyclic component, and that multiple functions are
    superposed.  Also :math:`a\\left(Z\\right)`
    is a piecewise linear function w.r.t. :math:`Z`


    For this particular function the :math:`\\mathbf{\\theta}` vector for
    each load is given by:

    .. math:: \\mathbf{\\theta}_{i}=
                \\int_{0}^1{
                  {a\\left(Z\\right)}
                  {\\sigma\\left(Z\\right)}
                  f\\left({Z}\\right)
                  \\phi_i\\,dZ}

    Where :math:`f\\left({Z}\\right)` is the appropriate z-dependent term
    corresponding to either :math:`u_{top}` or :math:`u_{bot}` homogenisations.


    The :math:`\\mathbf{E}` matrix for each load is given by:

    .. math:: \\mathbf{E}_{i,j}=
                \\int_{0}^{t_j}{
                  \\frac{d{
                    {\\cos\\left(\\omega\\tau+\\textrm{phase}\\right)}
                    \\sigma\\left(\\tau\\right)}}
                    {d\\tau}
                  {\\exp\\left({(dT\\left(t-\\tau\\right)\\lambda_i}\\right)}
                  \\,d\\tau}


    where

     - :math:`\\lambda_i` is the `ith` eigenvalue of the problem,
     - :math:`dT` is a time factor for numerical convienience,
     - :math:`\\sigma\left(\\tau\\right)` is the piecewise linear time
       dependant load.


    Note that the listed equations above are in terms of normalised depth Z,
    with depth integrations between [0, 1].  However, IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
    ARE DOING the integrations can be done using non-normalised depths.
    The first z value in the piecewise definition a(z) must still be 0
    however the end point for integration will be the final z value in the
    definition of a(z).  If you are doing this then your `m` values will
    include the normalising Factor. e.g. m = [pi/2/H, 3*pi/2/H] and a(z) is
    defined in two layers [0, z1], [z1, zend] as opposed to
    m = [pi/2, 3*pi/2] and a(Z) is two layers [0, z1/H], [z1/H, zend/H].

        drn=0 for Pervious top pervious bottom (PTPB).
        drn=1 for Pervious top impoervious bottom (PTIB).
    m : ``list`` of ``float``
        Eigenvalues of BVP, the m in sin(m*Z). Generate with
        geotecha.speccon.m_from_sin_mx.
    eigs : 1d numpy.ndarray
        List of eigenvalues of the spectral matrix i.e. Eigenvalues of the
        square Igam_psi matrix.
    tvals : 1d numpy.ndarray`
        List of time values to evaluate E matrix at.
    Igamv : ndarray
        Speccon matrix.  Igamv = inverse of [gam * v])
    a, b : PolyLine
        Piewcewise linear function.  e.g. for 1d consolidation surcharge
        radial draiange term is dTh*kh*et*u(Z,t) `a` would be kh, `b` would
        be et.
    top_vs_time, bot_vs_time : list of PolyLine
        Piecewise linear magnitude vs time for the top and bottom boundary.
        Use ``None`` if there is no variation.
    top_omega_phase, bot_omega_phase : list of 2 element tuples, optional
        (omega, phase) for use in cos(omega * t + phase) * mag_vs_time
        if omega_phase is None then mag_vs_time will not be multiplied by a
        cosine.  If any element of omega_phase is None then in that particular
        loading combo, mag_vs_time will not be multiplied by a cosine.
    dT : ``float``, optional
        Time factor multiple for numerical convieniece. Default dT=1.0.
    theta_zero_indexes : slice/list etc., optional
        A slice object, list, etc that can be used for numpy fancy indexing.
        Any specified index of the theta vector will be set to zero.  This is
        useful when using the spectral method with block matrices and the
        loading term only refers to a subset of the equations.  When using

    Returns
    -------
    E_Igamv_the : ndarray
        Loading matrix of size (neig, len(tvals)).

    Notes
    -----
    Assuming the loads are formulated as the product of separate time and depth
    dependant functions as well as a cyclic component:

    .. math:: \\sigma\\left({Z,t}\\right)=
                \\sigma\\left({Z}\\right)
                \\sigma\\left({t}\\right)
                \\cos\\left(\\omega t + \\phi\\right)

    the solution to the consolidation equation using the spectral method has
    the form:

    .. math:: u\\left(Z,t\\right)=
                \\mathbf{\\phi v E}
                \\left(\\mathbf{\\Gamma v}\\right)^{-1}
                \\mathbf{\\theta}


    When we consider non-zero boundary conditions, additional loading terms are
    created when we sub in the following into the original governing equation.

    .. math:: u\\left({Z,t}\\right)=
                v\\left({Z,t}\\right) +
                u_{top}\\left({t}\\right)\\left({1-Z}\\right) +
                u_{bot}\\left({b}\\right)Z

    Two additional loading terms are created with each substitution, one
    for the top boundary condition and one for the bottom boundary condition.

    This function calculates :math:`\\mathbf{E}\\left(\\mathbf{\\Gamma v}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{\\theta}`
    when substitutions are made in terms of the following form:


    .. math:: a\\left({Z}\\right)
              b\\left({Z}\\right)
              \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}

    It is assumed that :math:`u_{top}\\left({t}\\right)` and
    :math:`u_{bot}\\left({t}\\right)` are piecewise linear
    in time with a cyclic component, and that multiple functions are
    superposed.  Also :math:`a\\left(Z\\right)` and :math:`b\\left(Z\\right)`
    are piecewise linear functions w.r.t. :math:`Z`


    For this particular function the :math:`\\mathbf{\\theta}` vector for
    each load is given by:

    .. math:: \\mathbf{\\theta}_{i}=
                \\int_{0}^1{
                  {a\\left(Z\\right)}
                  {b\\left(Z\\right)}
                  {\\sigma\\left(Z\\right)}
                  f\\left({Z}\\right)
                  \\phi_i\\,dZ}

    Where :math:`f\\left({Z}\\right)` is the appropriate z-dependent term
    corresponding to either :math:`u_{top}` or :math:`u_{bot}` homogenisations.


    The :math:`\\mathbf{E}` matrix for each load is given by:

    .. math:: \\mathbf{E}_{i,j}=
                \\int_{0}^{t_j}{
                  \\frac{d{
                    {\\cos\\left(\\omega\\tau+\\textrm{phase}\\right)}
                    \\sigma\\left(\\tau\\right)}}
                    {d\\tau}
                  {\\exp\\left({(dT\\left(t-\\tau\\right)\\lambda_i}\\right)}
                  \\,d\\tau}


    where

     - :math:`\\lambda_i` is the `ith` eigenvalue of the problem,
     - :math:`dT` is a time factor for numerical convienience,
     - :math:`\\sigma\left(\\tau\\right)` is the piecewise linear time
       dependant load.


    Note that the listed equations above are in terms of normalised depth Z,
    with depth integrations between [0, 1].  However, IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
    ARE DOING the integrations can be done using non-normalised depths.
    The first z value in the piecewise definition a(z) must still be 0
    however the end point for integration will be the final z value in the
    definition of a(z).  If you are doing this then your `m` values will
    include the normalising Factor. e.g. m = [pi/2/H, 3*pi/2/H] and a(z) is
    defined in two layers [0, z1], [z1, zend] as opposed to
    m = [pi/2, 3*pi/2] and a(Z) is two layers [0, z1/H], [z1/H, zend/H].

    When we consider non-zero boundary conditions, additional loading terms are

    Two additional loading terms are created with each substitution, one

    This function calculates :math:`\\mathbf{E}\\left(\\mathbf{\\Gamma v}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{\\theta}`

    It is assumed that :math:`u_{top}\\left({t}\\right)` and
    :math:`u_{bot}\\left({t}\\right)` are piecewise linear
    in time with a cyclic component, and that multiple functions are

    Where :math:`f\\left({Z}\\right)` is the appropriate z-dependent term
    corresponding to either :math:`u_{top}` or :math:`u_{bot}` homogenisations.


    The :math:`\\mathbf{E}` matrix for each load is given by:

    .. math:: \\mathbf{E}_{i,j}=

                  {\\cos\\left(\\omega\\tau+\\textrm{phase}\\right)}
                  {\\sigma\\left(\\tau\\right)}
                  {\\exp\\left({(dT\\left(t-\\tau\\right)\\lambda_i}\\right)}
                  \\,d\\tau}


    where

     - :math:`\\lambda_i` is the `ith` eigenvalue of the problem,
     - :math:`dT` is a time factor for numerical convienience,
     - :math:`\\sigma\left(\\tau\\right)` is the piecewise linear time
       dependant load.


    Note that the listed equations above are in terms of normalised depth Z,
    with depth integrations between [0, 1].  However, IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
    ARE DOING the integrations can be done using non-normalised depths.
    The first z value in the piecewise definition a(z) must still be 0
    however the end point for integration will be the final z value in the
    definition of a(z).  If you are doing this then your `m` values will
    include the normalising Factor. e.g. m = [pi/2/H, 3*pi/2/H] and a(z) is
    defined in two layers [0, z1], [z1, zend] as opposed to
    m = [pi/2, 3*pi/2] and a(Z) is two layers [0, z1/H], [z1/H, zend/H].

    """Calculate E and theta parts and assemble E_Igamv_the matrix that arises
    from homogenising delta(Z-zd)*u(Z,t) for non_zero top and bottom

    When accounting for non-zero boundary conditions we homogenise the
    governing equation by letting u(Z,t) = v(Z,t) + utop(t)*(1-Z) + ubot(t)*Z
    and solving for v(Z, t).  This function calculates the time dependent
    E part, the depth dependent theta part, and then assembles
    E*inverse(gam*v)*theta which forms part of solution
    v(Z,t)=phi*v*E*inverse(gam*v)*theta.  The E and theta parts arise
    by subbing the boundary conditions into into governing equation terms of
    the form delta(Z-zd)*u(Z,t).

    The contribution of each `mag_vs_time`-`omega_phase` pairing

    Parameters
    ----------
    drn : [0,1]
        Drainage condition,
        drn=0 for Pervious top pervious bottom (PTPB).
        drn=1 for Pervious top impoervious bottom (PTIB).
    m : ``list`` of ``float``
        Eigenvalues of BVP, the m in sin(m*Z). Generate with
        geotecha.speccon.m_from_sin_mx.
    eigs : 1d numpy.ndarray
        List of eigenvalues of the spectral matrix i.e. Eigenvalues of the
        square Igam_psi matrix.
    tvals : 1d numpy.ndarray`
        List of time values to evaluate E matrix at.
    Igamv : ndarray
        Speccon matrix.  Igamv = inverse of [gam * v])
    zvals : list of float
        z values defining each delta function, zd.
    pseudo_k : list of float
        Coefficients to multiply each delta function by.
    top_vs_time, bot_vs_time : list of PolyLine
        Piecewise linear magnitude vs time for the top and bottom boundary.
        Use ``None`` if there is no variation.
    top_omega_phase, bot_omega_phase : list of 2 element tuples, optional
        (omega, phase) for use in cos(omega * t + phase) * mag_vs_time
        if omega_phase is None then mag_vs_time will not be multiplied by a
        cosine.  If any element of omega_phase is None then in that particular
        loading combo, mag_vs_time will not be multiplied by a cosine.
    dT : ``float``, optional
        Time factor multiple for numerical convieniece. Default dT=1.0.
    theta_zero_indexes : slice/list etc., optional
        A slice object, list, etc that can be used for numpy fancy indexing.
        Any specified index of the theta vector will be set to zero.  This is
        useful when using the spectral method with block matrices and the
        loading term only refers to a subset of the equations.  When using
        block matrices m should be the same size as the block matrix.
        Default theta_zero_indexes=None i.e. no elements of theta will be
        set to zero.

    Notes
    -----
    Assuming the loads are formulated as the product of separate time and depth
    dependant functions as well as a cyclic component:

    .. math:: \\sigma\\left({Z,t}\\right)=
                \\sigma\\left({Z}\\right)
                \\sigma\\left({t}\\right)
                \\cos\\left(\\omega t + \\phi\\right)

    the solution to the consolidation equation using the spectral method has
    the form:

    .. math:: u\\left(Z,t\\right)=
                \\mathbf{\\phi v E}
                \\left(\\mathbf{\\Gamma v}\\right)^{-1}
                \\mathbf{\\theta}


    When we consider non-zero boundary conditions, additional loading terms are
    created when we sub in the following into the original governing equation.

    .. math:: u\\left({Z,t}\\right)=
                v\\left({Z,t}\\right) +
                u_{top}\\left({t}\\right)\\left({1-Z}\\right) +
                u_{bot}\\left({b}\\right)Z

    Two additional loading terms are created with each substitution, one
    for the top boundary condition and one for the bottom boundary condition.

    This function calculates :math:`\\mathbf{E}\\left(\\mathbf{\\Gamma v}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{\\theta}`
    when substitutions are made in terms of the following form:


    .. math:: k_{\\textrm{pseudo}}
              \\delta\\left({Z-Z_d}\\right)
              u\\left({Z,t}\\right)

    It is assumed that :math:`u_{top}\\left({t}\\right)` and
    :math:`u_{bot}\\left({t}\\right)` are piecewise linear
    in time with a cyclic component, and that multiple functions are
    superposed.


    For this particular function the :math:`\\mathbf{\\theta}` vector for
    each load is given by:

    .. math:: \\mathbf{\\theta}_{i}=
                \\int_{0}^1{
                  k_{\\textrm{pseudo}}
                  \\delta\\left({Z-Z_d}\\right)
                  {\\sigma\\left(Z\\right)}
                  f\\left({Z}\\right)
                  \\phi_i\\,dZ}

    Where :math:`f\\left({Z}\\right)` is the appropriate z-dependent term
    corresponding to either :math:`u_{top}` or :math:`u_{bot}` homogenisations.


    The :math:`\\mathbf{E}` matrix for each load is given by:

    .. math:: \\mathbf{E}_{i,j}=
                \\int_{0}^{t_j}{
                  {\\cos\\left(\\omega\\tau+\\textrm{phase}\\right)}
                  {\\sigma\\left(\\tau\\right)}
                  {\\exp\\left({(dT\\left(t-\\tau\\right)\\lambda_i}\\right)}
                  \\,d\\tau}


    where

     - :math:`\\lambda_i` is the `ith` eigenvalue of the problem,
     - :math:`dT` is a time factor for numerical convienience,
     - :math:`\\sigma\left(\\tau\\right)` is the piecewise linear time
       dependant load.

    has only been formulated for Normalised depths between [0,1]

    a : PolyLine
        Piewcewise linear function.  e.g. for 1d consolidation surcharge

    This function calculates :math:`\\mathbf{E}\\left(\\mathbf{\\Gamma v}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{\\theta}`
    for terms of the following form:


    .. math:: a\\left({Z}\\right)\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial t}

    It is assumed that :math:`\\sigma\\left({t}\\right)` is piecewise linear
    in time with a cyclic component, and that multiple functions are
    superposed.  Also :math:`a\\left(Z\\right)`
    is a piecewise linear function with respect to :math:`Z`.

    Note that the listed equations above are in terms of normalised depth Z,
    with depth integrations between [0, 1].  However, IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
    ARE DOING the integrations can be done using non-normalised depths.
    The first z value in the piecewise definition a(z) must still be 0
    however the end point for integration will be the final z value in the
    definition of a(z).  If you are doing this then your `m` values will
    include the normalising Factor. e.g. m = [pi/2/H, 3*pi/2/H] and a(z) is
    defined in two layers [0, z1], [z1, zend] as opposed to
    m = [pi/2, 3*pi/2] and a(Z) is two layers [0, z1/H], [z1/H, zend/H].

    matrix that arises from homgenising D[a(Z)*D[u(Z, t),Z],Z] terms with
    non_zero top and bottom boundary conditions when modelling
    drains/wells/columns with finite permeability.

    When accounting for non-zero boundary conditions we homogenise the
    governing equation by letting u(Z,t) = v(Z,t) + utop(t)*(1-Z) + ubot(t)*Z
    and solving for v(Z, t).  For some problems the homogenisation process
    produces an additional term that has t be added to the usual solution of
    v(Z,t)=phi*v*E*inverse(gam*v)*theta
    i.e. v(Z,t)=phi*v*E*inverse(gam*v)*theta + f(t)*Ipsiw*theta
    This function calculates the f(t) and theta parts of the second term and
    then assembles the foft_Ipsiw_the matrix. These parts arise
    by subbing the boundary conditions into into governing equation terms of
    the form D[a(Z)*D[u(Z, t),Z],Z].


    Uses sin(m*Z) in the calculation of theta.

    Parameters
    ----------
    drn : [0,1]
        Drainage condition,
        drn=0 for Pervious top pervious bottom (PTPB).
        drn=1 for Pervious top impoervious bottom (PTIB).
    m : ``list`` of ``float``
        Eigenvalues of BVP, the m in sin(m*Z). Generate with
        geotecha.speccon.m_from_sin_mx.
    eigs : 1d numpy.ndarray
        List of eigenvalues of the spectral matrix i.e. Eigenvalues of the
        square Igam_psi matrix.
    tvals : 1d numpy.ndarray`
        List of time values to evaluate E matrix at.
    Ipsiw : ndarray, square matrix
        Speccon matrix.  Ipsiw was originally
        formulated/denoted for vertical peremability term in the well
        resistance flow equation for vertical drain consolidatoin with
        well resistance.  It is different, but still a square matrix, for
        the stone column consolidation problem.  As long as you know what you
        are doing Ipsiw can be any appropriate square matrix.
    a : PolyLine
        Piewcewise linear function.  e.g. for 1d consolidation surcharge
        radial draiange term is D[kv(z)*D[u(Z,t), Z],Z] so `a` would be kv.
        be et.
    top_vs_time, bot_vs_time : list of PolyLine
        Piecewise linear magnitude vs time for the top and bottom boundary.
        Use ``None`` if there is no variation.
    top_omega_phase, bot_omega_phase : list of 2 element tuples, optional
        (omega, phase) for use in cos(omega * t + phase) * mag_vs_time
        if omega_phase is None then mag_vs_time will not be multiplied by a
        cosine.  If any element of omega_phase is None then in that particular
        loading combo, mag_vs_time will not be multiplied by a cosine.
    dT : ``float``, optional
        Time factor multiple for numerical convieniece. Default dT=1.0.
    theta_zero_indexes : slice/list etc., optional
        A slice object, list, etc that can be used for numpy fancy indexing.
        Any specified index of the theta vector will be set to zero.  This is
        useful when using the spectral method with block matrices and the
        loading term only refers to a subset of the equations.  When using
        block matrices m should be the same size as the block matrix.
        Default theta_zero_indexes=None i.e. no elements of theta will be
        set to zero.

    Returns
    -------
    foft_Ipsiw_the: ndarray
        Additional homgenising term of size (neig, len(t)).

    Notes
    -----
    Assuming the loads are formulated as the product of separate time and depth
    dependant functions as well as a cyclic component:

    .. math:: \\sigma\\left({Z,t}\\right)=
                \\sigma\\left({Z}\\right)
                \\sigma\\left({t}\\right)
                \\cos\\left(\\omega t + \\phi\\right)

    the solution to consolidation equation using the spectral method has a
    similar form to the following:

    .. math:: u\\left(Z,t\\right)=
                \\mathbf{\\phi} \\mathbf{v} \\mathbf{E}
                \\left(\\mathbf{\\Gamma v}\\right)^{-1}
                \\mathbf{\\theta}

    When we consider non-zero boundary conditions, additional loading terms are
    created when we sub in the following into the original governing equation.

    .. math:: u\\left({Z,t}\\right)=
                v\\left({Z,t}\\right) +
                u_{top}\\left({t}\\right)\\left({1-Z}\\right) +
                u_{bot}\\left({b}\\right)Z

    As well as loading terms the process may produce an extra term to be
    added to the final solution of the following form:

    .. math::   \\mathbf{\\phi}
                \\sigma\\left({t}\\right)
                \\mathbf{\\psi}_{w}^{1}
                \\mathbf{\\theta}_w

    There are actually two of these terms one
    for the top boundary condition and one for the bottom boundary condition.

    This function calculates :math:`\\sigma\\left({t}\\right)\\mathbf{\\psi}_{w}^{-1}\\mathbf{\\theta}_w`

    when substitutions are made in terms of the following form:

    .. math:: \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z}
                \\left(
                  {a\\left({Z}\\right)
                  \\frac{\\partial u\\left({Z,t}\\right)}{\\partial Z}}
                \\right)


    It is assumed that :math:`u_{top}\\left({t}\\right)` and
    :math:`u_{bot}\\left({t}\\right)` are piecewise linear
    in time with a cyclic component, and that multiple functions are
    superposed.  Also :math:`a\\left(Z\\right)`
    is a piecewise linear function with respect to :math:`Z`


    For this particular function the :math:`\\mathbf{\\theta}` vector for
    each load is given by:

    .. math:: \\mathbf{\\theta}_{i}=
                \\int_{0}^1{
                  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z}
                  \\left(
                    {a\\left({Z}\\right)
                    \\frac{\\partial \\sigma\\left({Z}\\right)}{\\partial Z}}
                  \\right)
                  f\\left({Z}\\right)
                  \\phi_i\\,dZ}

    Where :math:`f\\left({Z}\\right)` is the appropriate z-dependent term
    corresponding to either :math:`u_{top}` or :math:`u_{bot}` homogenisations.


    The time dependent function evaluated at each time produces a matrix
    that we will call :math:`\\mathbf{E}` (not to be confused with other E
    matrices) which is given by:

    .. math:: \\mathbf{E}_{j}=
                 {\\sigma\\left(t_j\\right)}
                 {\\cos\\left(\\omega t_j+\\textrm{phase}\\right)}


    Note that the listed equations above are in terms of normalised depth Z,
    with depth integrations between [0, 1].  However, IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
    ARE DOING the integrations can be done using non-normalised depths.
    The first z value in the piecewise definition a(z) must still be 0
    however the end point for integration will be the final z value in the
    definition of a(z).  If you are doing this then your `m` values will
    include the normalising Factor. e.g. m = [pi/2/H, 3*pi/2/H] and a(z) is
    defined in two layers [0, z1], [z1, zend] as opposed to
    m = [pi/2, 3*pi/2] and a(Z) is two layers [0, z1/H], [z1/H, zend/H].
