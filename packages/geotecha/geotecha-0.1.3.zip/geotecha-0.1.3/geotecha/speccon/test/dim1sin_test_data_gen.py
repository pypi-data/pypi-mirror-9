"""Quick and dirty code to generate some results for testing against
geotecha-speccon-integrals-dim1sin type funcitons.

Generally tests by:

 - 2 layers const within a layer
  - prop = 1 between [0,0.4] and prop = 2 between [0.4, 1].
 - 1 layer linear within layer
  - prop varies from 1 to 2 on [0, 1].  This gives the simpole eqation
    prop = 1 + x

This module contains some `eval` commands that can be a security threat. Rather
than fix the problem I've hard coded in some 'if False' instances that you will
have to hardcode back to 'if True' for them to work.
