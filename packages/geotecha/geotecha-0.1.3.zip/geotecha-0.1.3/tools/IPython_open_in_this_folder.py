"""Script to start Ipython Notebook Server in current working directory

IPython will open with --NotebookManager.save_script=True which means a .py 
version of all notebooks will be saved along with the default .ipynb notebook 
version.

Basically a glorified shortcut.

Assumes ipython.exe is on the path somewhere.
