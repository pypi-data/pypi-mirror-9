        Python-jamo is a Python Hangul syllable decomposition and sythesis library
        for working with Hangul characters and jamo (U+11xx).
        
        Currently in early release, only modern Hangul is currently supported
        (no U+317x, ㆀ, ㆄ, or other archaic stuff).
        Support for archaic Hangul will probably be added in the future.
        
        Originally designed to help students identify difficult-to-spell words
        containing (ㅔ,ㅐ) or (ㅗ,ㅜ), this project hopes to fill the niche of Korean
        phonetic and spelling analysis.
