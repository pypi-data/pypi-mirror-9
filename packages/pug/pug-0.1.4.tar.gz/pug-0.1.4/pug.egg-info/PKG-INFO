        ## Installation
        
        ### On a Posix System
        
        You really want to contribute, right?
        
            git clone
        
        If your a user and not a developer, and have an up-to-date posix OS with the postgres, xml2, and xlst development packages installed, then use `pip`.
        
            pip install pug
        
        ### Fedora
        
        If you're on Fedora >= 16 but haven't done a lot of python binding development, then you'll need some libraries before pip will succeed.
        
            sudo yum install -y python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel gcc-gfortran python-scikit-learn postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-libs postgresql-devel
            pip install pug
        
        ### Bleeding Edge
        
        Even the releases are very unstable, but if you want to have the latest, most broken code
        
            pip install git+git://github.com/hobsonlane/pug.git@master
        
        ### Warning
        
        This software is in alpha testing.  Install at your own risk.
