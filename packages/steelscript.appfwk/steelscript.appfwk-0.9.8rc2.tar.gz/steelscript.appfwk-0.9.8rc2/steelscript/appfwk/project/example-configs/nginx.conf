#    Example configuration script for nginx webserver used in combination with
#    a WSGI server such as gunicorn running on port 8888.
#
#    This assumes the flyscript_portal directory has been installed under
#    the root directory /flyscript.  Make sure to update the paths below to
#    match your configuration.
#
#    You will also need to update the IP address under `proxy_pass` to
#    match your localhost IP.  When running under a virtual machine,
#    just setting this to 127.0.0.1 doesn't seem to reliably work.
