Description: PyLyrics: A Pythonic Implementation of lyrics.wikia.com
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        PyLyrics is a python module to get Lyrics of songs from
        lyrics.wikia.com. It has support for getting albums of a singer and
        songs from an album from which lyrics can be accessed.
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Installation is done using pip.
        
        ::
        
            pip install PyLyrics
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        PyLyrics provides various lyrics.wikia.com methods by using many layers
        of Abstraction. Firstly there are 3 core classes which define most of
        the return values of PyLyrics:
        
        1. Track: Returned in Album Track searches and contains methods to get
           lyrics of the track
        2. Album: Returned from Artist album searches and contains methods to
           get tracks
        3. Artist: Returned from Artist searches and contains methods to get
           Albums
        
        Some examples are shown below on usage:
        
        Search for a Artist and list Albums
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from PyLyrics import *
        
            albums = PyLyrics.getAlbums(singer='Eminem')
            for a in albums:
                print (a) #Each album printed is a Album Object
        
        List all tracks of an Album
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        
        You need to pass a Album Object into the function. This step is required
        to prevent errors and to ensure result
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from PyLyrics import *
        
            albums = PyLyrics.getAlbums(singer='Eminem')
            myalbum = albums[4] #Select your album based on Index
        
            tracks = myalbum.tracks() #or PyLyrics.getTracks(myalbum)
            for track in tracks:
                print (track) #Each track is a track object
                print (track.getLyrics()) #Get the lyrics
        
        Get Lyrics of a song
        ''''''''''''''''''''
        
        There are two ways to do this. Either you can pass the name of the
        singer and the song name to the main function or use the bound method
        ``getLyrics()`` of the track object received as shown in the previous
        example.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from PyLyrics import *
        
            print(PyLyrics.getLyrics('Taylor Swift','Blank Space')) #Print the lyrics directly
