        ===============
        
        ``ftw.activity`` provides a view with an activity stream for Plone.
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4teamwork/ftw.activity/master/docs/screenshot.png
        
        
        How it works
        ============
        
        The feed is based on a simple catalog query restricted to the current
        context, ordered by modified date so that the newest modifications are
        on top.
        
        **Limitations:**
        
        - The ordering by modified date is not exactly accurate since the
          precision of the catalog index is only down to the minute.
        - Since it is based on a catalog query each object only appears once
          even when it is edited multiple times in a row.
        - Only existing objects are listed, so deleting objects will not appear
          in the feed at all.
        - Only actions which change the modification date are covered.
        - We do not register any links or actions, so that you can integrate
          it into Plone as you like. See the usage sections.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        
        - Add ``ftw.activity`` as dependency to your package (``setup.py``) or
          to your buildout configuration:
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                ftw.activity
        
        - Install the generic import profile in Plone's addons control panel.
        
        Once the package is installed there is no link to the view.
        The view is available as ``/activity`` on any context, so you might
        want to place a link anywhere you like or add an action.
        
        For collections, ``ftw.activity`` registers an ``Activity`` view which
        can be selected as default view. Just make sure to sort the collection
        by modification date and reverse it for best experience.
        
        ``ftw.activity`` also registers an
        `ftw.tabbedview <https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.tabbedview>`_
        tab with the name ``tabbedview_view-activity``.
        
        
        Custom event representations
        ============================
        
        By default the each event is represented by some metadata
        (e.g. author with portrait, action, etc) and the title of the modified
        object.
        
        If you'd like to display more information you can do this by registering
        a custom representation adapter in your custom code.
        
        Register the adapter in your ZCML:
        
        .. code:: xml
        
          <adapter factory=".activity.IssueResponseRepresentation"
                   for="..interfaces.IIssueResponse *"
                   provides="ftw.activity.interfaces.IActivityRepresentation"
                   />
        
        create the adapter class (example `./activity.py`):
        
        .. code:: python
        
          from ftw.activity.browser.representations import DefaultRepresentation
          from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile
        
          class IssueResponseRepresentation(DefaultRepresentation):
              index = ViewPageTemplateFile('templates/issue_representation.pt')
        
              # helper methods when needed
        
        and a template (example `./templates/issue_representation.pt`):
        
        .. code:: html
        
          <metal:wrapper use-macro="context/@@activity_macros/macros/event">
            <metal:CONTENT fill-slot="body-content">
        
              <div class="issue-text"
                   tal:content="context/text" />
        
            </metal:CONTENT>
          </metal:wrapper>
        
        take a look at the
        `activity_macros <https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.activity/blob/master/ftw/activity/browser/templates/activity_macros.pt>`_
        for details on what slots you can fill.
