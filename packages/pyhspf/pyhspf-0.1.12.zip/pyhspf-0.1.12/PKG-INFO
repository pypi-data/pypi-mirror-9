Description: PyHSPF contains a library of subroutines to run the Hydrological 
        Simulation Program in Fortran (HSPF), Python extensions to the HSPF 
        library, and a series of classes for building HSPF input files, 
        performing simulations, and postprocessing simulation results.  
        
        HSPF requires flowline and catchment data for a stream network, land use 
        data for the stream reach subbasins, time series data of climate 
        parameters, and hydrology parameters for each land use category/subbasin.  
        These data sources (with the exception of the hydrology parameters) can be 
        supplied externally as needed (e.g., using Python extensions for 
        geographic information systems (GIS) software). Alternatively, a 
        series of preprocessing classes and routines were developed based on 
        flowline and catchment data from the National Hydrolography Dataset 
        Version 2 (NHDPlus), climate data from the National Climate Data Center, 
        and landuse data from the National Agricultural Statitistics Service (NASS)
        Cropland Data Layer (CDL). The "core" module requires NumPy, SciPy, and
        Matplotlib, and can be used for generating input files. The preprocessing 
        routines require GDAL, PyShp, and Pillow and make a series of specific
        assumptions about the location and availability of data sources on the 
        computer.
        
        PyHSPF can be used to assimilate the data into an HSPF model, build the 
        HSPF input files, simulate the model over a period of time, and then 
        provide statistics and plots of the simulation output. A series 
        of examples is provided to illustrate PyHSPF usage.
