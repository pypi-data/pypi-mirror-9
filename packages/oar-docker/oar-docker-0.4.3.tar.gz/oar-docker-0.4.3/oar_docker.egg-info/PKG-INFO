Description: Build your own OAR cluster with docker
        --------------------------------------
        
        oar-docker is a set of docker images especially configured for deploying
        your own OAR cluster. The main idea is to have a mini development cluster with
        a frontend, a server and some nodes that launch in just a few seconds on a
        simple laptop.
        
        
        Why use oar-docker ?
        --------------------
        
        Various case scenarios may affect you:
         - Quickly test OAR on a cluster
         - Gain time: a ten-node cluster (or more) is launched in just a
           few seconds and is cleaned in less than a second.
         - Save resources: docker allows the user to pool the node between
           various systems, resource utilization is thus considerably reduced.
         - Synced volume : allowing you to continue working on your host machine, but
           use the resources in the guest machine to compile or run your project.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Requirements:
          - python >= 2.7
          - docker >= 1.3
        
        You can install, upgrade, uninstall oar-docker with these commands::
        
          $ pip install [--user] oar-docker
          $ pip install [--user] --upgrade oar-docker
          $ pip uninstall oar-docker
        
        Or from git (last development version)::
        
          $ pip install git+https://github.com/oar-team/oar-docker.git
        
        Or if you already pulled the sources::
        
          $ pip install path/to/sources
        
        Or if you don't have pip::
        
          $ easy_install oar-docker

        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        To get started with oar-docker, the first thing to do is to initialize a
        project::
        
            $ oardocker init
        
        If you already have OAR sources, the best is to initialize directly the
        oardocker project in the OAR sources directory::
        
            $ cd path/to/oar/src
            $ oardocker init
        
        You have to do this only once. It allows you to import the Dockerfiles
        and other configuration files.
        
        We then launch the base image build::
        
            $ oardocker build
        
        Now, we have to install OAR. To do this, several options are available.
        
        If you already have the OAR sources::
        
            $ oardocker install /path/to/oar_src
        
        Or if you want to install from tarball::
        
            $ oardocker install http://oar-ftp.imag.fr/oar/2.5/sources/testing/oar-2.5.4+rc4.tar.gz
        
        You can also launch the installation from a git repository::
        
            $ oardocker install git+https://github.com/oar-team/oar.git
        
        
        We start a OAR cluster with 5 nodes::
        
            $ oardocker start -n 5
        
        It is possible to share directories between host machines and
        all containers with the ``-v`` option::
        
            $ oardocker start -v $PWD:/oar_src -v /my/custom/lib:/usr/local/ma_lib
        
        To manage the cluster::
        
            $ oardocker connect frontend|server|nodeXX
            $ oardocker logs [frontend|server|nodeXX]
        
        
        To clean::
        
            $ oardocker stop  ## stops and removes all containers
            $ oardocker clean  ## removes all stopped containers (failed) and the untagged images <none:none>
            $ oardocker destroy  ## removes all images and containers
        
        
        With oar-docker, it is possible to chain all commands to go faster::
        
            $ oardocker init -f build install oar-2.5.4+rc4.tar.gz start -n 4 connect -l root frontend
        
        For instance, to develop on OAR, we often need to install OAR,
        start the cluster and connect to it::
        
        
            $ oardocker install $PWD start -n 10 -v $PWD:/home/docker/oar_src connect frontend
        
        
        One last thing to know. The ``stop`` command is automatically launched before
        every ``start``, ``install`` and ``build`` ... If we launch multiple times the
        last command, we will always obtain the same result. It can be useful to
        experiment and develop (even) faster.
        
        
        Security
        --------
        
        oar-docker is a development project and a testing one. It is in no way secure.
        Besides, the private ssh key used is also insecured since it is public (you can
        find it in the sources).
