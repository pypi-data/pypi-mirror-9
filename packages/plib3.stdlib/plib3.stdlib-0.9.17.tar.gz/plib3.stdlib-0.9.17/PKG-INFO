Description: The PLIB3.STDLIB package contains a number of useful packages
        and modules that extend the Python 3 standard library.
        
        Note: PLIB3.STDLIB works with Python 3. If you are using Python
        2.7, see the PLIB.STDLIB package, available at
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plib.stdlib.
        
        The ``setup.py`` script for PLIB3.STDLIB uses the ``setuputils``
        helper module, which helps to automate away much of the
        boilerplate in Python 3 setup scripts. This module is available
        as a separate release at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuputils3.
        
        The PLIB3.STDLIB Packages and Modules
        -------------------------------------
        
        The following modules or sub-packages are available in the
        ``plib.stdlib`` namespace:
        
        - The ``builtins`` module contains some funtions that should be
          Python builtins, but aren't. :) Importing the module adds those
          functions to the built-in namespace; this is mostly useful for
          interactive shells. The functions can also be imported directly
          from ``plib.stdlib.builtins``, to make it easier to understand
          where the functions are coming from in module code.
        
        - The ``classes`` sub-package provides some miscellaneous useful
          classes.
        
        - The ``classtools`` module provides some utilities for working
          with classes and class attributes.
        
        - The ``cmdline`` module provides utilities useful for command
          line programs and interactive shells.
        
        - The ``coll`` sub-package provides various collection classes,
          including abstract collections built on the ``collections``
          ABCs from the standard library.
        
        - The ``comm`` sub-package provides utilities for managing and
          communicating with child threads and processes.
        
        - The ``copytools`` module provides functions to copy function
          and code objects, which ``copy.copy`` in the Python standard
          library just returns unchanged. This allows copies of such
          objects to be made with selected attributes changed.
        
        - The ``csvtools`` module provides useful functions for working
          with CSV files.
        
        - The ``dbtools`` sub-package implements a simple interface for
          working with databases using the Python DB API.
        
        - The ``decotools`` module provides functions and factories for
          working with decorators.
        
        - The ``extensions`` sub-package provides a namespace for functions
          (and possibly, in the future, other objects) exported from an
          extension module written using the Python/C API. The general
          philosophy of PLIB3 is to do everything possible in pure
          Python, so the only functions that appear in this sub-package
          are those which by their very nature cannot be done in pure
          Python.
        
        - The ``fdtools`` module provides utilities for working with file
          descriptors.
        
        - The ``imp`` module provides the ``import_from_module`` function,
          which should be in the standard library ``importlib`` module
          but isn't. :)
        
        - The ``ini`` sub-package implements an abstract 'INI file' API that
          uses ``ConfigParser`` on POSIX systems, and the Windows registry
          on Windows systems. This API allows the configuration file
          structure to be declared using Python lists and dicts.
        
        - The ``iters`` module provides various functions dealing with
          or returning iterables.
        
        - The ``jsontools`` module provides convenience functions for
          loading and saving JSON files, and for "extended" JSON that
          allows "literal" Python types like tuples that standard JSON
          does not support.
        
        - The ``localize`` module provides useful functions for getting
          locale-specific information.
        
        - The ``mail`` module provides a useful shortcut function for
          sending email from programs.
        
        - The ``mathlib`` module provides some additional math functions
          to supplement those in the standard library.
        
        - The ``net`` module provides utilities for getting information
          about networks.
        
        - The ``options`` module provides an easier-to-use overlay for
          the ``argparse`` module which allows you to express your option
          configuration in the form of Python lists, tuples, and dicts.
        
        - The ``ostools`` module provides utilities for working with the
          operating system.
        
        - The ``postinstall`` module provides utilities for use by
          post-install scripts.
        
        - The ``proc`` module provides two shortcut functions for getting
          the output of a subprocess.
        
        - The ``sigtools`` module provides a low-level implementation of
          the self-pipe trick for signal handling.
        
        - The ``strings`` module provides functions and constants for
          working with strings.
        
        - The ``systools`` module exposes some useful variables giving
          information about the Python runtime system and PLIB3 itself.
        
        - The ``timer`` module provides functions for timing code, with
          an alternate API to the standard library's ``timeit`` module
          that is easier to use when timing functions that you already
          have as objects, instead of source code strings.
        
        - The ``tztools`` module provides some useful ``tzinfo`` subclasses
          based on those in the Python docs for the ``datetime`` module,
          and a function to return the local system timezone name.
        
        - The ``util`` sub-package provides the ``ModuleProxy`` class, which
          is used by a number of PLIB3 sub-packages. See the docstrings
          for the class and the sub-packages using it for more information.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install PLIB3.STDLIB, you can simply run::
        
            $ python3 setup.py install
        
        at a shell prompt from the directory into which you
        unzipped the source tarball (the same directory that this
        README file is in). This will install PLIB3 and then
        run each of the post-install scripts in the scripts
        directory.
