**README** for PLIB3.STDLIB 0.9.21

:Author:        Peter A. Donis
:Release Date:  21 Feb 2015

The PLIB3.STDLIB package contains a number of useful packages
and modules that extend the Python 3 standard library.

Note: PLIB3.STDLIB works with Python 3. If you are using Python
2.7, see the PLIB.STDLIB package, available at
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plib.stdlib.

The ``setup.py`` script for PLIB3.STDLIB uses the ``setuputils``
helper module, which helps to automate away much of the
boilerplate in Python 3 setup scripts. This module is available
as a separate release at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuputils3.

The PLIB3.STDLIB Packages and Modules
-------------------------------------

The following modules or sub-packages are available in the
``plib.stdlib`` namespace:

- The ``builtins`` module contains some funtions that should be
  Python builtins, but aren't. :) Importing the module adds those
  functions to the built-in namespace; this is mostly useful for
  interactive shells. The functions can also be imported directly
  from ``plib.stdlib.builtins``, to make it easier to understand
  where the functions are coming from in module code.

- The ``classes`` sub-package provides some miscellaneous useful
  classes.

- The ``classtools`` module provides some utilities for working
  with classes and class attributes.

- The ``cmdline`` module provides utilities useful for command
  line programs and interactive shells.

- The ``coll`` sub-package provides various collection classes,
  including abstract collections built on the ``collections``
  ABCs from the standard library.

- The ``comm`` sub-package provides utilities for managing and
  communicating with child threads and processes.

- The ``copytools`` module provides functions to copy function
  and code objects, which ``copy.copy`` in the Python standard
  library just returns unchanged. This allows copies of such
  objects to be made with selected attributes changed.

- The ``csvtools`` module provides useful functions for working
  with CSV files.

- The ``dbtools`` sub-package implements a simple interface for
  working with databases using the Python DB API.

- The ``decotools`` module provides functions and factories for
  working with decorators.

- The ``extensions`` sub-package provides a namespace for functions
  (and possibly, in the future, other objects) exported from an
  extension module written using the Python/C API. The general
  philosophy of PLIB3 is to do everything possible in pure
  Python, so the only functions that appear in this sub-package
  are those which by their very nature cannot be done in pure
  Python.

- The ``fdtools`` module provides utilities for working with file
  descriptors.

- The ``imp`` module provides the ``import_from_module`` function,
  which should be in the standard library ``importlib`` module
  but isn't. :)

- The ``ini`` sub-package implements an abstract 'INI file' API that
  uses ``ConfigParser`` on POSIX systems, and the Windows registry
  on Windows systems. This API allows the configuration file
  structure to be declared using Python lists and dicts.

- The ``iters`` module provides various functions dealing with
  or returning iterables.

- The ``jsontools`` module provides convenience functions for
  loading and saving JSON files, and for "extended" JSON that
  allows "literal" Python types like tuples that standard JSON
  does not support.

- The ``localize`` module provides useful functions for getting
  locale-specific information.

- The ``mail`` module provides a useful shortcut function for
  sending email from programs.

- The ``mathlib`` module provides some additional math functions
  to supplement those in the standard library.

- The ``net`` module provides utilities for getting information
  about networks.

- The ``options`` module provides an easier-to-use overlay for
  the ``argparse`` module which allows you to express your option
  configuration in the form of Python lists, tuples, and dicts.

- The ``ostools`` module provides utilities for working with the
  operating system.

- The ``postinstall`` module provides utilities for use by
  post-install scripts.

- The ``proc`` module provides two shortcut functions for getting
  the output of a subprocess.

- The ``sigtools`` module provides a low-level implementation of
  the self-pipe trick for signal handling.

- The ``strings`` module provides functions and constants for
  working with strings.

- The ``systools`` module exposes some useful variables giving
  information about the Python runtime system and PLIB3 itself.

- The ``timer`` module provides functions for timing code, with
  an alternate API to the standard library's ``timeit`` module
  that is easier to use when timing functions that you already
  have as objects, instead of source code strings.

- The ``tztools`` module provides some useful ``tzinfo`` subclasses
  based on those in the Python docs for the ``datetime`` module,
  and a function to return the local system timezone name.

- The ``util`` sub-package provides the ``ModuleProxy`` class, which
  is used by a number of PLIB3 sub-packages. See the docstrings
  for the class and the sub-packages using it for more information.

Installation
------------

To install PLIB3.STDLIB, you can simply run::

    $ python3 setup.py install

at a shell prompt from the directory into which you
unzipped the source tarball (the same directory that this
README file is in). This will install PLIB3 and then
run each of the post-install scripts in the scripts
directory.

The Zen of PLIB3
----------------

There is no single unifying purpose or theme to PLIB3, but
like Python itself, it does have a 'Zen' of sorts:

- Express everything possible in terms of built-in Python
  data structures.

- Once you've expressed it that way, what the code is
  going to do with it should be obvious.

- Avoid boilerplate code, *and* boilerplate data. Every
  piece of data your program needs should have one and
  only one source.
