This script sets up symlinks in $PREFIX/bin to each of the
example programs that come with PLIB3, and byte-compiles
the examples, on systems that support symlinks (i.e.,
POSIX systems only). On other systems (i.e., Windows),
the example programs and their associated files are instead
simply copied to the Python/Scripts directory.
