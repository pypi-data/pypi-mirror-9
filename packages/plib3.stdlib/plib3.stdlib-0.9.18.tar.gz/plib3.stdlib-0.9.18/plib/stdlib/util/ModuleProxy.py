This module contains the ModuleProxy class. For examples
of intended use cases for this class, check out the
``main.py`` module in the PLIB3.GUI sub-package, or any
of a number of ``__init__.py`` modules in the PLIB3.IO
sub-packages. The docstrings and comments there give more
information.

One note about usage: whenever importing from a package
that uses this functionality, absolute imports should be
used. Using relative imports risks running afoul of the
name ambiguity between the object you want to import (a
class, usually) and the module it's defined in. Absolute
imports are "purer" anyway, so this is not viewed as a
bothersome restriction.

# Note that we subclass types.ModuleType in order to fool
# various introspection utilities (e.g., pydoc and the builtin
# 'help' command in the interpreter) into thinking ModuleProxy
# instances are actual modules. Among other things, this is
# necessary for the builtin 'help' command to properly display
# the info from the proxied module's docstring (setting the
# proxy's __doc__ to the actual module's __doc__ is *not*
# enough to do this by itself); note also that we don't
# override the constructor because various Python internals
# expect module objects to have a particular signature for
# the constructor; instead, we add the init_proxy method which
# must be called immediately on constructing the object to do
# the proxying magic
