Module JSONTOOLS -- Tools for JSON and similar file formats
Sub-Package STDLIB of Package PLIB3
Copyright (C) 2008-2014 by Peter A. Donis

These are convenience functions for loading/saving JSON
from/to filenames. Also, functions are added to support
"extended" JSON, which includes tuples and other non-dynamic
Python types that standard JSON does not support. Note that
no checking is done in the "extended" methods to ensure that
only "allowed" types are used when saving/dumping; the only
check is done on loading, since ``ast.literal_eval`` will
only accept certain types.
