This module contains the ``SigIntMixin`` class. This is a mixin
class for servers that can be closed by Ctrl-C (or by other
termination signals if the ``term_sigs`` class field is
changed in a subclass), but which do not need any other complex
functionality.

import signal


class SigIntMixin(object):
    """Mixin class for processes to do controlled shutdown on Ctrl-C.
    
    The signals to be trapped and treated as "termination" signals
    can be changed by overriding the ``term_sigs`` class field.
    
    Note that this is not, strictly speaking, new functionality;
    Python by default traps Ctrl-C and raises KeyboardInterrupt,
    which by default causes a program exit; but that does not allow
    for the program to do any shutdown processing unless it
    explicitly traps the exception, which does not always fit in
    with the program's structure. This class traps the signal and
    integrates it into the program's general signal handler. The
    Python default also prints a messy traceback, which this class
    eliminates.
