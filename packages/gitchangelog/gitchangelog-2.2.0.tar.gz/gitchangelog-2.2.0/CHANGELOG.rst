Changelog
=========

2.2.0 (2015-01-27)
------------------

New
~~~

- Provide support for older config file format. [Valentin Lab]

- Added 'octobercms-plugin' mako template. (fixes #16) [Valentin Lab]

- Added ``body_process`` and ``subject_process`` options. (fixes #22)
  [Valentin Lab]

  These options superseeds ``replace_regexps`` and ``body_split_regexp``
  as they provide a full control over text transformation of the subject
  or the body of the commit before they get included in the changelog.


- Added ``include_merge`` option to filter out merge commit. [Casey
  Duquette]

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Produce a more linear commit history (fixes #14) [Casey Duquette]

  Instead of retrieving the git log ordered by date, retrieve the log as
  a difference between tags to produce a more accurate view of changes
  between releases.

  For instance, imagine this git graph::

    * 6c0fd62 (HEAD, tag: sprint-6, origin/smoke, smoke, develop)
    *   5292a28 Merge back to develop
    |\
    | * 6612fce (tag: sprint-5.1, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) super important hotfix
    * | 7d6286f more development work
    * | 8c1e3d6 continued development work
    * | fa3d4bd development work
    |/
    * ec1a19c (tag: sprint-5)

  Previously, commits ``fa3d4bd``, ``8c1e3d6``, ``7d6286f`` that
  occurred on the develop branch before the hotfix that led to tagging
  ``sprint-5.1``, were captured in the changelog under release
  ``sprint-5.1`` because of the order of the commits. But it is obvious
  that these commits were not included in a release until
  ``sprint-6``. The new method of calculating the changelog will capture
  this and reflect it properly, assigning those changes to ``sprint-6``.


Fix
~~~

- Last commit was omitted (fixes #23). [Valentin Lab]

- Bogus messages when template didn't exist. [Valentin Lab]

  Refactored out the common code and corrected the bad error message.


- Removed hypothetical memory exhaust while parsing ``git log``.
  [Valentin Lab]

  Parse stdout as it's produced by git log by chunks.


2.1.2 (2014-04-25)
------------------

Fix
~~~

- Fail with error message when config path exists but is not a file.
  (fixes #11) [Casey Duquette]

  For example, the config file could be a directory.


2.1.1 (2014-04-15)
------------------

Fix
~~~

- Removed exception if you had file which name that matched a tag's
  name. (fixes #9) [Valentin Lab]

2.1.0 (2014-03-25)
------------------

New
~~~

- Python3 compatibility. [Valentin Lab]

- Much greater performance on big repository by issuing only one shell
  command for all the commits. (fixes #7) [Valentin Lab]

- Add ``init`` argument to create a full ``.gitchangelog.rc`` in current
  git repository. [Valentin Lab]

- Remove optional first argument that could specify the target git
  repository to consider. [Valentin Lab]

  This is to remove duplicate way to do things. ``gitchangelog`` should be run
  from within a git repository.

  Any usage of ``gitchangelog MYREPO`` can be written ``(cd MYREPO;
  gitchangelog)``.


- Use a standard formatting configuration by default. [Valentin Lab]

  A default `standard` way of formatting is used if you don't provide
  any configuration file. Additionaly, any option you define in your
  configuration file will be added "on-top" of the default configuration
  values. This can reduce config file size or even remove the need of
  one if you follow the standard.

  And, thus, you can tweak the standard for your needs by providing only partial
  configuration file. See tests for examples.


- Remove user or system wide configuration file lookup. [Valentin Lab]

  This follows reflexion that you build a changelog for a repository and
  that the rules to make the changelog should definitively be explicit and
  thus belongs to the repository itself.

  Not a justification, but removing user and system wide configuration files
  also greatly simplifies testability.


Fix
~~~

- Encoding issues with non-ascii chars. [Valentin Lab]

- Avoid using pipes for windows compatibility and be more performant by
  avoiding to unroll full log to get the last commit. [Valentin Lab]

- Better support of exotic features of git config file format. (fixes
  #4) [Valentin Lab]

  git config file format allows ambiguous keys:

      [a "b.c"]
          d = foo
      [a.b "c"]
          e = foo
      [a.b.c]
          f = foo

  Are all valid. So code was simplified to use directly ``git config``.
  This simplification will deal also with cases where section could be
  attributed values:

      [a "b"]
          c = foo
      [a]
          b = foo

  By avoiding to parse the entire content of the file, and relying on
  ``git config`` implementation we ensure to remain compatible and not
  re-implement the parsing of this file format.


- Gitchangelog shouldn't fail if it fails to parse your git config.
  [Michael Hahn]

  Lab]

~~~~~~~

- Removed old ``gitchangelog.rc.sample`` in favor of the new documented
  one. [Valentin Lab]

------------------

New
~~~

- Added a new sample file heavily documented. [Valentin Lab]

------------------

New
~~~

- Added ``body_split_regexp`` option to attempts to format correctly

Fix
~~~

- ``git`` in later versions seems to fail on ``git config <key>`` with
  errlvl 255, that was not supported. [Valentin Lab]
