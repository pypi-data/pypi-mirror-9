Description: Python TBX - Toolbox Library
        ============================
        
        
        About
        -----
        
        Python Toolbox aka TBX is a collection of very different tools created over the years to simplify my coding.
        As a library, this has no purpose by itself and should be used by other projects.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Just look at the code as it is commented for your to understand its usage.
        
        No big doc made yet. This is more of a personal collection of snippets and tools.
        
        But if somebody is interested or requests it, I will make a better doc.
        
        
        Compatibility

        This libraries are used most on Linux and OSX systems, but plenty of functions may work on windows.
        
        This libraries are compatibles with Python 2.X and Python 3.X.
