Security
********
Security is an important aspect of ringo. This chapter will describe the
permission system and explains how ringo handle common security threats.

.. _permissionsystem:
Permission System
=================
The permission system addresses two basic questions:

1. **Who is allowed** to access some item in general and
2. **What is allowed** for the user to access, in case he is generally allowed
   to access the item.

To answer these two questions the permission system of Ringo is a combination
of concepts of the permission system known from the `Unix file system  <http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions>`_ and a
`roles based permission system <http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control>`_.

The Unix file system part answers the first question: Who is allowed? Therefor
every item in the system inherited from the :ref:`mixin_owned` stores
information to which owner and which group it belongs to. Only the owner,
members of the group or users with an administrational role are granted access
to the item in general.

After the permission to access the item in general is allowed, the role bases
system answers the second question: What is allowed. The permission system
will now check which :ref:`roles` the users have and which actions are allowed for
these roles.

There are currently two ways a user can be equiped with permissions:

1. If the user is the owner of the item, or is member of the items group, then
all permissions of the users roles will be applied.

2. If the user is member of the items group, then the permissins of the group
will additionally be applied.

.. note::
        Currently there is no anonymous access to the item. See Issue61 in the
        ringo bugtracker. A workaround might be to setup a user group with
        all users of the system and assing the needed roles to it. Then set
        this group as the item group.

See :ref:`authorisation` for more details on this.

.. _authentification:

Authentification
----------------
Authentication is done once in the login process. If the user has logged in
successful an auth cookie is saved. From then on the user object is loaded
from the database on every request with the roles and groups attached to the
user.  This user object is used later for the Authorisation. If the user is
not logged in the user object is empty.

The authentification has a default timeout of 30min. The timeout will be reset
after every new request of the user. The timeout can be configured in the
application configuration bei setting the 'auth.timeout' config variable.

.. _authorisation:

Authorisation
-------------
The permission system in Ringo uses the Pyramid `Pyramid Authorisation and
Authenfication API <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/security.html>`_

Authorisation is done on every request. The authorisation will check if the
user is allowed to access the requested resource.

A resource is an url or an item which is accessed by calling the url in your
application.  In all cases this resource is build from a resource factory for
every request.  Every resource will have an ACL which determines if the user of
the current request (See :ref:`authentification`) is allowed to access the
resource.

Ringo's part in the authorisation process is to build the ACL. This ACL is
then used by the Pyramid security API. Therefor ringo implements helper
functions to build ACL lists which model the ringo permission system.

See `Adding Authorization tutorial
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/tutorials/wiki2/authorization.html>`_
for more information how things work in general under the hood.

See :ref:`api-security` for documentation on helper functions used to build
the ACL.

Custom authorisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you need to change the way Ringo builds the ACL on default you can change this behavior by 
overwriting the ``_get_permissions`` class method of the BaseItem in your model.

Authorisation inheritance

Security measurements
=====================
Ringo has protection against common threads of webapplication included.

CSRF-Protection
---------------
To protect against CSRF attacks ringo follows the recommodation of `OWASP
<http://url>`_ and adds a synchroniser token to each form, which will be sent
and checked on each POST request. The token will be unique on every request.
GET requests in ringo are not protected as GET functions in ringo should be
idempotent and does not trigger expensive opertaions. Following this simple
philosophie on GET requests will make any further CSRF protection obsolete.

XSS-Protection
--------------
Ringo will add the following headers to protect the application against XSS attacks.

 * 'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
 * 'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff'

Further ringo provides an option to enable a contect CSP for further
protection. The CSP is disabled on default but can be enabled in the
application :ref:`conf_headers` configuration.

Clickjacking-Protection
-----------------------
Cookie and Session security
---------------------------

DOS-Protection
--------------
DOS protection is not handled by ringo. Protection against DOS-attacks should
be handled by the Reverse Proxy or Firewall.
