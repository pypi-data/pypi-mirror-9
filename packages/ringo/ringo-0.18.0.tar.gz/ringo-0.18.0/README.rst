Ringo is a small Python based high level web application framework build with
Pyramid. Ringo tries to make it very easy to build form based web application
to manage your data. Because ringo provides many basic features which are
often used in modern webapplications it greatly speeds up development. But it
is also flexible and offers many ways to configure the layout, behaviour and
workflow of your application. See the list of :ref:`features` for more
details.

Ringo comes with an application scaffold which can be used as a boilerplate for
your application development. See the development part in the documentation
for more details on how to build a Ringo based application.
