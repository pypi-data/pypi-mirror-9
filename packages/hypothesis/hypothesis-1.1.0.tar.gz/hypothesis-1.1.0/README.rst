Hypothesis is a library for property based testing in Python, based on the Haskell
library Quickcheck. It's designed to integrate seamlessly into your existing
Python unit testing work flow.

Hypothesis is easy to use, stable, and extremely powerful. If you're not using
Hypothesis to test your project then you're missing out.

examples of usage is `available at readthedocs <http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/master/>`_.
