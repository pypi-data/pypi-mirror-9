    Make a ``deploy()`` function, for uploading files to the server.

    During a deployment, one usually needs to upload certain additional files
    to the server.  It's also often necessary to dynamically define certain
    settings etc. within these files.  The :func:`upload_template()` and
    :func:`put()` functions, respectively, handle uploading files which do and
    do not require dynamic variable substitution.

    The return value from ``make_deploy()`` is a function which will call
    ``put()`` or ``upload_template()`` based on whether or not the file path
    ends with ``'.template'``.

    To make the ``deploy()`` function even simpler for the caller, it will
    assume a certain context for local file paths.  This means one only need
    provide a base file name when calling ``deploy()``, and it will be
    interpreted as relative to the function's context path.

    The ``deploy_path`` argument is used to establish the context path for the
    function.  If it is a folder path, it will be used as-is; otherwise it will
    be constructed by joining the parent folder of ``deploy_path`` with the
    value of ``last_segment``.

    Typical usage then is something like::

       from rattail.fablib import make_deploy

       deploy = make_deploy(__file__)

       deploy('rattail/init-filemon', '/etc/init.d/rattail-filemon',
              mode='0755')

       deploy('rattail/rattail.conf.template', '/etc/rattail.conf')

    This shows what is intended to be typical, i.e. where ``__file__`` is the
    only argument required for ``make_deploy()``.  For the above to work will
    require you to have something like this file structure, where
    ``fabfile.py`` is the script which contains the above code::

       myproject/
       |-- fabfile.py
       |-- deploy/
           `-- rattail/
               |-- init-filemon
               |-- rattail.conf.template
    """

        deploy_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(deploy_path), last_segment))

    def deploy(local_path, remote_path, **kwargs):
        local_path = '{0}/{1}'.format(deploy_path, local_path)
        if local_path.endswith('.template'):
            upload_template(local_path, remote_path, context=env, **kwargs)
        else:
            put(local_path, remote_path, **kwargs)

    return deploy
