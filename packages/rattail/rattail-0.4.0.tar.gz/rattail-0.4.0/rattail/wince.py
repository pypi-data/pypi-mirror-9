    This function is meant to be invoked by the file monitor.  Its purpose is
    to gather handheld scan batch files from arbitrary device-specific folders,
    and move them to yet another ("upstream") folder so that they may be part
    of a single processing queue.  Rather than moving the file as-is, the
    following processing is done on the file:

    Since the Rattail CE app saves the batch contents using a somewhat "binary"
    format, the raw file is parsed (with :func:`parse_batch_file()`) and a
    proper CSV file is written with the "translated" contents.  This file is
    then copied to the collection folder.

    The filename used for the final destination path is also manipulated.
    Instead of using the original filename, one is generated which contains the
    original filename, plus the "device name" and the timestamp of the original
    file.  The ``device`` parameter is used to determine the device name.
