    Class to abstract the details of Global Product Code data.  Examples of
    this would be UPC or EAN barcodes.

    The initial motivation for this class was to provide better SIL support.
    To that end, the instances are assumed to always be comprised of only
    numeric digits, and must include a check digit.  If you do not know the
    check digit, provide a ``calc_check_digit`` value to the constructor.
    """

        """
        Constructor.  ``value`` must be either an integer or a long value, or a
        string containing only digits.

        If ``calc_check_digit`` is ``False``, then ``value`` is assumed to
        include the check digit.  If the value does not include a check digit
        and needs one to be calculated, then ``calc_check_digit`` should be a
        keyword signifying the algorithm to be used.

        Currently the only check digit algorithm keyword supported is
        ``'upc'``.  As that is likely to always be the default, a
        ``calc_check_digit`` value of ``True`` will be perceived as equivalent
        to ``'upc'``.
