js.fullcalendar
===============

Introduction
------------

This library packages `FullCalendar`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`FullCalendar`: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.fullcalendar``) are published to some URL.
