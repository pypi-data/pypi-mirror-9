        ===============
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `FullCalendar`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`FullCalendar`: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.fullcalendar``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``fullcalendar`` from ``js.fullcalendar`` and ``need``
        it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.fullcalendar import fullcalendar
          >>> fullcalendar.need()
