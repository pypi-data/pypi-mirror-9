Setting up images and SEDs
==========================

There are two main kinds of images/SEDs that can be produced for each model:
images/SEDs computed by binning the photons as they escape from the density
grid, and images/SEDs computed by peeling off photon packets at each
interaction into well defined directions. The latter provide more accurate
SEDs and much better signal-to-noise, and are likely to be more commonly used
than the former.

The code currently allows at most one set of binned images, and any number
of sets of peeled images. A set is defined by a wavelength range, image
resolution and extent, and any number of viewing angles.

Creating a set of images
------------------------

To add a set of binned images/SEDs to the model, use::

    image = m.add_binned_images()

and to create a set of peeled images/SEDs to the model, use::

    image = m.add_peeled_images()

Only one set of binned images can be added, but any number of sets of peeled
image can be added. In general, peeled images are recommended because binned
images suffer from low signal-to-noise, and angle averaging of images.

The wavelength range (in microns) for the images/SEDs should be specified using::

    image.set_wavelength_range(n_wav, wav_min, wav_max)

The image size in pixels and the extent of the images should be specified using::

    image.set_image_size(n_x, n_y)
    image.set_image_limits(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)

where the image limits should be given in cm. The apertures for the SEDs can
be specified using::

    image.set_aperture_range(n_ap, ap_min, ap_max)

where the apertures should be given in cm. If this is not specified, the
default is to have one aperture with infinite size, i.e. measuring all the
flux.

For binned images, the number of bins in the theta and phi direction should be
specified using::

    image.set_viewing_bins(10, 10)

whereas for peeled images, the viewing angles should be specified as lists or
arrays of theta and phi values, in degrees. For example, the following
produces images from pole-on to edge-on at constant phi using 20 viewing
angles::

    # Set number of viewing angles
    n_view = 20

    # Generate the viewing angles
    theta = np.linspace(0., 90., n_view)
    phi = np.repeat(45., n_view)

    # Set the viewing angles
    image.set_viewing_angles(theta, phi)

.. note:: For peeled images, the number of viewing angles directly impacts the
          performance of the code - once the specific energy/temperature has
          been computed, the code will then run approximately in a time
          proportional to the number of viewing angles.

Uncertainties
-------------

Uncertainties can be computed for SEDs/images (doubling the memory/disk space required)::

    image.set_uncertainties(True)

Stokes components
-----------------

By default, to save memory and disk space, the Stokes components other than I
for the images are not saved. To enable the storage of the Stokes components
other than I, make use of the ``set_stokes`` method::

    sed.set_stokes(True)

or::

    image.set_stokes(True)

If you do not do this, then you will not be able to make use of the ``stokes=``
option in :meth:`~hyperion.model.ModelOutput.get_sed` and
:meth:`~hyperion.model.ModelOutput.get_image`.

.. note:: In Hyperion 0.9.3 and earlier versions, this option did not exist and
          Stokes components were all saved by default. Note that the default
          behavior is now changed. However, files produced in Hyperion 0.9.3
          and earlier will behave as if the option was set to `True` for
          backward-compatibility.

File output
-----------

Finally, to save space, images can be written out as 32-bit floats instead of
64-bit floats. To write them out as 32-bit floats, use::

    image.set_output_bytes(4)

and to write them out as 64-bit floats, use::

    image.set_output_bytes(8)

Tracking photon origin
----------------------

SEDs/images can also be split into emitted/thermal or scattered components
from sources or dust (4 combinations). To activate this, use::

    image.set_track_origin('basic')

It is also possible to split the SED into individual sources and dust types::

    image.set_track_origin('detailed')

For example, if five sources and two dust types are present, there will be 14
components in total: five for photons emitted from sources, two for photons
emitted from dust, five for photons emitted from sources and subsequently
scattered, and two for photons emitted from dust and subsequently scattered.

Finally, it is also possible to split the photons as a function of how many times they scattered::

    image.set_track_origin('scatterings', n_scat=5)

where ``n_scat`` gives the maxmimum number of scatterings to record.

See :ref:`post-processing` for information on how to extract this information
from the output files.

.. note:: If you are using the :class:`~hyperion.model.AnalyticalYSOModel`
          class and are interested in separating the disk, envelope, and other
          components, but are using the same dust file for the different
          components, these will by default be merged prior to the radiative
          transfer calculation, so you will need to set
          ``merge_if_possible=False`` when
          calling :meth:`~hyperion.model.AnalyticalYSOModel.write` to prevent this
          (see :meth:`~hyperion.model.AnalyticalYSOModel.write` for more
          information).

Disabling SEDs or Images
------------------------

When adding a set of binned or peeled images, it is possible to disable the
SED or image part::

    image = m.add_binned_images()  # Images and SEDs
    image = m.add_binned_images(image=False)  # SEDs
    image = m.add_binned_images(sed=False)  # Images

    image = m.add_peeled_images()  # Images and SEDs
    image = m.add_peeled_images(image=False)  # SEDs
    image = m.add_peeled_images(sed=False)  # Images

Advanced
--------

A few more advanced parameters are available for peeled images, and these are
described in :doc:`../advanced/peeloff`.

Example
-------

The following example creates two sets of peeled SEDs/images. The first is used to produce an SED with 250 wavelengths from 0.01 to 5000. microns with uncertainties, and the second is used to produce images at 5 wavelengths between 10 and 100 microns, with image size 100x100 and extending +/-1pc in each direction::

    image1 = m.add_peeled_images(image=False)
    image1.set_wavelength_range(250, 0.01, 5000.)
    image1.set_uncertainties(True)

    image2 = m.add_peeled_images(sed=False)
    image2.set_wavelength_range(5, 10., 100.)
    image2.set_image_size(100, 100)
    image2.set_image_limits(-pc, +pc, -pc, +pc)
