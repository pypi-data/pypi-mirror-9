Hyperion documentation
======================

Introduction
------------

This is the documentation for `Hyperion <http://www.hyperion-rt.org>`_, a
three-dimensional dust continuum Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. Models
are set up via Python scripts, and are run using a compiled Fortran code,
optionally making use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel
computing.

.. important:: **Before you proceed, please make sure you have read the
               following disclaimers**:

               * The developers cannot guarantee that the code is bug-free,
                 and users should sign up to the `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/hyperion-announce>`_ to ensure that
                 they are informed as soon as bugs are identified and fixed.
                 The developers cannot be held responsible for incorrect
                 results, regardless of whether these arise from incorrect
                 usage, a bug in the code, or a mistake in the
                 documentation.

               * Users should read the :doc:`important/important` before using
                 Hyperion. In particular, users are fully responsible for
                 ensuring that parameters such as photon numbers and grid
                 resolution are adequate for the problem being studied.
                 Hyperion will *not* raise errors if these inputs are
                 inadequate.

Note on units and constants
---------------------------

All quantities in Hyperion are expressed in the cgs system. Throughout the
documentation, constants are sometimes used in place of values (e.g. ``au``,
``pc``). These can be imported (in Python) using::

    from hyperion.util.constants import *

or, to control which constants are imported::

    from hyperion.util.constants import au, pc, lsun

See :doc:`api/hyperion.util.constants` for more details.
