        =========
        
        
        1.3.2 (2015-03-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix the import bug, introduced of previous commit.
        
        
        1.3.1 (2015-03-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix import of GeolocationField.
        
        
        1.3 (2015-03-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Remove browserlayer, which isn't needed any more. Includes an Upgrade step.

        - Switch to Attribute storage instead of Annotation storage. This is easier to
          access and needs less ZODB unpickling. It's unlikely that two behaviors share
          the same geolocation schema name. A upgrade step is provided.
          [thet]
        
        - Removed code related to Google Maps integration. The integration is better
          done with Mockup Javascript.
          [thet]
        
        - PEP8.

        1.2 (2014-04-30)
        ----------------
        
        - Add italian translation
          [gborelli]
        
        - Remove dependency on Products.Maps and copy some of it's interfaces to here.
          Note, Google Map integration is not available at this point.
          For mapping functionality I suggest to backport the Leaflet integration from
          collective.venue.
          [thet]
        
        - Remove dependency on Grok and use Dexterity 2 way with plone.supermodel to
          define the schema.
