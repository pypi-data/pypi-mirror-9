        This packages main goal is to provide:
        
        * Basic ZODB-based content type skeleton for `Pyramid <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/docs/pyramid.html>`_.
        * Dynamic content types that can be adapted to pretty much suit most purposes.
        * Ability to make highly pluggable components sutable for frameworks.
        * Easy integration with `colander <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/colander/en/latest/>`_.
        
        This package currently lacks proper documentation, but should be pretty stable regarding API changes since it's used
        in production in other open source projects.
        
        
        Possible TODOs:
        ---------------
        * Custom field adapters instead of custom field types. No point in storing persistent content types unless needed.
        * With field adapters content types don't need special settings.
        * This might require an introspection tool, otherwise it might appear to "magical".
        * A way to transform input before it's saved.
        
        
        
        0.3b - 2015-03-27
        -----------------
        
        - suggest_name method now handles non-ascii better. This changed
          the dependencies from 'slugify' to 'awesome-slugify'.
        
        0.2b - 2014-02-11
        -----------------
        
        - Possibility to bind zope interfaces to schemas so objectevents will work as expected.
          This enables subscribers for schemas.
        - Factory names can now be omitted - the class name is used in that case.
        - Python 3 should work now.
        
        0.1a4 - 2012-09-05
        ------------------
        
        - New method to make sure new objects aren't stored with the same name as an
          existing view. Before it was possible to name objects the same way as views. [robinharms]
        
        0.1a3 - 2012-02-14
        ------------------
        
        - Typo on code caused description to be stored under the wrong attribute of
          the schema when using createSchema. [robinharms]
        
        0.1a2 - 2012-02-14
        ------------------
        
        - If title and descriptions are specified for the schema factory, also transfer
          them to the schema itself. (Colander Schemas are transfered to Schema nodes on
          construction, which enables title and description) [sassur]
        
        0.1a1 - 2011-10-14
        ------------------
        
        - Exception raised when custom accessors or mutators created a loop. [robinharms]
        - Exposing field_storage as a public attribute should remove the need to
          the switch to override custom accessors / mutators. So it has been removed.
          Hopefully this will make it easier to use. [robinharms]
