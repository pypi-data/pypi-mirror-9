Description: =======================
         ftw.maintenanceserver
        =======================
        
        Provides a simple server serving a static directory, which can be configured
        as haproxy backup server, kicking in when all normal servers are offline.
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        It is simple HTTP server, serving a static directory.
        All requests which match no file in the static directory are responded with
        the ``index.html`` which is expected to be placed in the static directory.
        
        This is useful when a user is visiting the page at any URL while the maintenance
        server is activated. The user then stays at the same URL and can refresh until
        the system is back online and he is at the same place as he was before.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The server can be installed using zc.buildout, which generates a pre configured
        ``bin/maintenance`` script::
        
            [buildout]
            parts += maintenance
        
            [maintenance]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs = ftw.maintenanceserver
            arguments = '${buildout:directory}/static', 8088
        
        
        HAProxy configuration
        ---------------------
        
        When using HAProxy the server can be simply configured as ``backup`` server,
        which will only be used when all "normal" servers are offline::
        
            backend plone
            server plone1 127.0.0.1:8080 cookie p1 check downinter 15s maxconn 5 rise 1 slowstart 60s
            server plone2 127.0.0.1:8081 cookie p2 check downinter 15s maxconn 5 rise 1 slowstart 60s
            server maintenance 127.0.0.1:8088 check backup
