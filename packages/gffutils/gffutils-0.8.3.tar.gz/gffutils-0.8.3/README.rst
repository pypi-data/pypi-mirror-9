See docs at http://pythonhosted.org/gffutils/.

``gffutils`` is a Python package for working with and manipulating the GFF and
GTF format files typically used for genomic annotations.  Files are loaded into
a sqlite3 database, allowing much more complex manipulation of hierarchical
features (e.g., genes, transcripts, and exons) than is possible with plain-text
methods alone.
