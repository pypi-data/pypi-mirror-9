Description: python-jss Introduction:
        ========================
        
        This project aims to offer simple, elegant, pythonic access to the Jamf
        Casper JSS API.
        
        Jamf provides access to the JSS and most of its object types through a
        REST API. python-jss allows you interact with the API to create new
        objects, list or edit the existing ones, and to upload files to
        configured distribution points.
        
        The level of coverage for convenience methods and properties is
        primarily centered on Computer management, and specifically, those
        aspects which factor into policy and package management.
        
        Automating policy creation is streamlined; however, class
        ``MobileDeviceInvitations`` provides nothing beyond basic ``JSSObject``
        methods and properties to the API. Those aspects which I use heavily in
        our organization, and in support of
        `jss-autopkg-addon <https://www.github.com/sheagcraig/jss-autopkg-addon>`__,
        tend to be more fleshed out, whereas aspects of the JSS API that I never
        use tend to be minimalistic. However, based on the code here, it should
        be easy for anyone wishing to do so to implement a ``new()`` method for
        those objects they're interested in, and I would be happy to include
        them. Send me your pull requests!
        
        Installing:
        ===========
        
        The easiest method is to use pip to grab python-jss:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install python-jss
        
        If you don't have pip, you should probably get it:
        https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html
        
        Alternately, download the source and copy the python-jss package
        wherever you normally install your packages.
        
        Behind the scenes, python-jss uses requests and Greg Neagle's
        FoundationPlist. Check them out at: requests:
