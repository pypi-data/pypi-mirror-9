        PyNaCl is a Python binding to the `Networking and Cryptography library`_,
        a crypto library with the stated goal of improving usability, security and
        speed.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        PyNaCl relies on libsodium_, a portable C library which can be compiled
        on a variety of systems. It may already be available from your package
        manager.
        
        .. _libsodium: https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium
        
        Once libsodium is installed, PyNaCl can be installed by:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Digital signatures
        * Secret-key encryption
        * Public-key encryption
        * HMAC (coming soon)
        
        
        Changes
        -------
        
        * 0.3.0: the low-level API (`nacl.c.*`) has been changed to match the
          upstream NaCl C/C++ conventions (as well as those of other NaCl bindings).
          The order of arguments and return values has changed significantly. To
          avoid silent failures, `nacl.c` has been removed, and replaced with
          `nacl.bindings` (with the new argument ordering). If you have code which
          calls these functions (e.g. `nacl.c.crypto_box_keypair()`), you must review
          the new docstrings and update your code/imports to match the new
          conventions.
