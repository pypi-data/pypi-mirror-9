About pyModis
==============

Requirements
-------------

``pyModis`` requires **Python GDAL** and **Numpy** packages.

If you want to use the Graphical User Interface you have to
install also **wxPython** library.

You can use also software is `MODIS Reprojection Tool <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/modis_reprojection_tool>`_
to convert or mosaic MODIS HDF files.

How to install pyModis
-----------------------

Using pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From version 0.6.3 it is possible to install ``pyModis`` using
`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_. You have to run the following
command as administrator

::

  pip install pyModis

If you need to update your ``pyModis`` version you have to run

::

  pip install --upgrade pyModis

With ``pip`` it is also really simple to remove the library

::

  pip uninstall pyModis

Compile from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compile ``pyModis`` is very simple. First you need to download ``pyModis``
source code from `github repository <https://github.com/lucadelu/pyModis>`_.

You can use `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ to download the latest code
(with the whole history and so it contain all the different stable versions,
from the last to the first) ::

    git clone https://github.com/lucadelu/pyModis.git

or `download the latest stable version <https://github.com/lucadelu/pyModis/tags>`_
from the repository and decompress it.

Now enter the ``pyModis`` folder and launch as administrator of 
your computer ::

    python setup.py install

If the installation doesn't return any errors you should be able to use
``pyModis`` library from a Python console. Then, launch a your favorite
Python console (I really suggest ``ipython``) and digit ::

    import pymodis

If the console doesn't return any error like this ::

    ImportError: No module named pymodis

the ``pyModis`` library has been installed properly and you can use it
or one of the tools distributed with ``pyModis``.

Install on Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simple way to install ``pyModis`` on Windows is to install latest Python 2.7
from http://python.org/download/

Now you have to modify the "Path" environment variable using *powershell* running

.. only:: html

  ::

    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\", "User")

.. only:: latex

  ::

    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path",
    "$env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\", "User")

Download and install the last version of Distribute for Windows from
http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py

At this point you have to move to standard command line (*cmd*) and install *pip*
using *easy_install* ::

    easy_install pip

Now install `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ library using *easy_install* because
installation from pip is broken (this is required only for version >= 0.7.1) ::

    easy_install numpy GDAL

If you want the Graphical User Interface you have to install also **wxPython** ::

    easy_install WxPython WxPython-Common

Finally install ``pyModis`` using *pip* ::

    pip install pyModis

If you want use the GUI you have to `download and install wxPython <http://www.wxpython.org/download.php>`_

Troubleshooting
------------------

Problem installing dependencies with pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes *pip* return error when it try to install Python GDAL, Numpy or wxPython.
You can solve this problem installing Python GDAL or Numpy using the
version of your operating system.


How to report a bug
--------------------

the `issues tracker of github <https://github.com/lucadelu/pyModis/issues>`_.

How to compile documentation

    make <target>

with one of the following target to obtain the desired output:

  - **html**: to make standalone HTML files
  - **dirhtml**: to make HTML files named index.html in directories
  - **singlehtml**: to make a single large HTML file
  - **pickle**: to make pickle files
  - **json**: to make JSON files
  - **htmlhelp**: to make HTML files and a HTML help project
  - **qthelp**: to make HTML files and a qthelp project
  - **devhelp**: to make HTML files and a Devhelp project
  - **epub**: to make an epub
  - **latex**: to make LaTeX files, you can set PAPER=a4 or PAPER=letter
  - **latexpdf**: to make LaTeX files and run them through pdflatex
  - **text**: to make text files
  - **man**: to make manual pages
  - **texinfo**: to make Texinfo files
  - **info**: to make Texinfo files and run them through makeinfo
  - **gettext**: to make PO message catalogs
  - **changes**: to make an overview of all changed/added/deprecated items
  - **linkcheck**: to check all external links for integrity

To insert a link to PDF file of pyModis documentation into HTML documentation
(the link will be added on the sidebar) you have to compile first the PDF and
