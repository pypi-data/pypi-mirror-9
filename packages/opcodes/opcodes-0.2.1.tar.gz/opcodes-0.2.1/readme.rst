Opcodes Project
===============

The goal of this project is to document instruction sets in a format convenient for tools development. An instruction set is represented by three files:

- An XML file that describes instructions
- An XSD file that describes the structure of the XML file
- A Python module that reads the XML file and represents it as a set of Python objects

This project is a spin-off from `Peach-Py <https://bitbucket.org/MDukhan/peachpy>`_ assembler.

Current status
--------------

The project provides descriptions for most user-mode x86 and x86-64 instructions up to AVX2 and SHA (including 3dnow!+, XOP, FMA3, FMA4, TBM and BMI2). The following instructions are currently **NOT** supported:

- All priveledged instructions and user-mode system instructions (e.g. XSAVE, SLDT)
- Legacy string/streaming instructions (MOVS/SCAS/CMPS/STOS/LODS)
- LOCK and REP/REPZ/REPNZ prefixes
- x87 FPU instructions
- VIA Padlock instructions
- Intel HTM instructions
- Intel AVX-512 instructions

For each instruction the following information is provided:

- Summary description
- Instruction names in Intel assembly (`Peach-Py <https://bitbucket.org/MDukhan/peachpy>`_, `NASM <http://nasm.us>`_, `YASM <http://yasm.tortall.net>`_ and MASM assemblers), AT&T assembly (GNU assembler) and Plan 9 assembly (`Go <https://golang.org>`_ assembler)
- Operand types and characteristics (whether the operand is input or output)
- Implicit input and output registers
- ISA where this instruction was introduced
- Whether the instruction operates on FPU or MMX state
- Whether the instruction operates on AVX or legacy SSE state
- Whether the instruction has no dependency on input values when input operands refer to the same register (e.g. `XOR eax, eax` has no dependency on `eax`)
- Whether the instruction that writes to a 32-bit register is recognized by x86-64 Native Client validator as zero-extending
