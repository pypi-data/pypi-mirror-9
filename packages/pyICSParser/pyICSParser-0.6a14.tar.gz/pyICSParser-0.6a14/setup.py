    long_description="""\
    pyICSParser is a Python module that provides support for the iCalendar specification as defined in RFC5545.
    
    It aims to be as compatible as possible to iCalendar for its inputs and outputs (RFC5545 strict mode)
    
    Beyond iCalendar strict compatibility is also targets compatibility with RFC2445 (RFC2445-backward compatibility) and with popular calendaring applications (iCal, Outlook, google calendar, ...)
    
    This support includes a Parser, Object Model, Validator, Generator and events instances enumerator for iCalendar files.
