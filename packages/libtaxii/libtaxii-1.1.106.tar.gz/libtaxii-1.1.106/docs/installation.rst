Installation
============

Recommended Installation
------------------------

Use pip_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install libtaxii

You might also want to consider using a virtualenv_.

.. _pip: http://pip.readthedocs.org/
.. _virtualenv: http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/


Dependencies
------------

The libtaxii library is developed on Python 2.7 and tested against both
Python 2.6 and 2.7. Besides the Python Standard Library, libtaxii relies on
the following Python libraries:

* lxml_ - A Pythonic binding for the C libraries **libxml2** and
  **libxslt**.
* python-dateutil_ - A library for parsing datetime information.

Each of these can be installed with ``pip`` or by manually downloading packages
from PyPI. On Windows, you will probably have the most luck using `pre-compiled
binaries`_ for ``lxml``. On Ubuntu (12.04 or 14.04), you should make sure the
following packages are installed before attempting to compile ``lxml`` from
source:

* libxml2-dev
* libxslt1-dev
* zlib1g-dev

.. note::

    In libtaxii 1.0.101 and earlier, the M2Crypto library was also required.
    This dependency was removed as of libtaxii 1.0.102.

.. warning::

   Users have encountered errors with versions of libxml2 (a dependency of
   lxml) prior to version 2.9.1.  The default version of libxml2 provided on
   Ubuntu 12.04 is currently 2.7.8.  Users are encouraged to upgrade libxml2
   manually if they have any issues.  Ubuntu 14.04 provides libxml2 version
   2.9.1.

Manual Installation
-------------------

If you are unable to use pip, you can also install libtaxii with setuptools_.
If you don't already have setuptools installed, please install it before
continuing.

1. Download and install the dependencies_ above. Although setuptools will
   generally install dependencies automatically, installing the dependencies
   manually beforehand helps distinguish errors in dependency installation from
   errors in libtaxii installation. Make sure you check to ensure the
   versions you install are compatible with the version of libtaxii you plan
   to install.

2. Download the desired version of libtaxii from PyPI_ or the GitHub releases_
   page. The steps below assume you are using the |release| release.

3. Extract the downloaded file. This will leave you with a directory named
   libtaxii-|release|.

.. parsed-literal::
    $ tar -zxf libtaxii-|release|.tar.gz
    $ ls
    libtaxii-|release| libtaxii-|release|.tar.gz

OR

.. parsed-literal::
    $ unzip libtaxii-|release|.zip
    $ ls
    libtaxii-|release| libtaxii-|release|.zip

4. Run the installation script.

.. parsed-literal::
    $ cd libtaxii-|release|
    $ python setup.py install

5. Test the installation.

.. parsed-literal::
    $ python
    Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
    [GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import libtaxii
    >>>

If you don't see an ``ImportError``, the installation was successful.
