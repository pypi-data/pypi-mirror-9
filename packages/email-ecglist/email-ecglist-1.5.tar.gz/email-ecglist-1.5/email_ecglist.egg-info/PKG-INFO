Description: ========
        ECG List
        ========
        
        This package provides simple access to the austrian RTR (Rundfunk und Telekom
        Regulierungs-GmbH) "ECG list", the registry of persons and companies who do
        not wish to receive promotional e-mail.
        
        Typical usage looks like this::
        
            from ecglist import ECGList
        
            e = ECGList()
            if not e.get_blacklist_status_code(email):
                send_email(email)
            else:
                print "%s does not want to receive email" % email
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Set up the interface::
        
            from ecglist import ECGList
        
            # Defaults to reading "ecg-liste.hash" in current directory
            blacklist = ECGList(filename="my-ecg-list.hash")
        
        Test for an email address being in the blacklist::
        
            "foo@bar.example" in blacklist
        
        Get an email's status code::
        
            code = blacklist["foo@bar.example"]
        
        `code` will be None if the email address was not found in the blacklist or
        a status code indicating the type of match otherwise.
        
        Same, but get a human readable string instead of a status code::
        
            status_str = blacklist.get_blacklist_status("foo@bar.example")
        
        
        Background
        ----------
        
        Service providers that send unsolicited advertising e-mail have to observe this list.
        Please refer to https://www.rtr.at/en/tk/E_Commerce_Gesetz for the legal background.
        Unfortunately, the only sample code provided by the RTR is in Perl (Boo! Hiss!), which
        prompted the creation of this module.
        
        
        Obtaining the official blacklist
        --------------------------------
        
        You will need to follow the steps outlined at https://www.rtr.at/en/tk/NutzenECG
        to obtain a copy of the current ECG list. Save the "ecg-liste.hash" you receive
        and configure the ECGList to access that file.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install this module, simply: ::
        
        	$ pip install email-ecglist
