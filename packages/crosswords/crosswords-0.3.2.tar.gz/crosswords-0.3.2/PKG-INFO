        **crosswords** is a terminal tool to help you solving crosswords.
        
        This is a full rewrite of a script I wrote back in 2011.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        .. code-block::
        
            pip install crosswords
        
        To upgrade a previous installation, use:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            pip install -U crosswords
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code-block::
        
            crosswords [-l <language>] <word>
        
        Your word should have ``?`` characters for each letter you don't know, e.g.:
        ``bon??ur``. By default, the tool returns up to 8 possible words.
        
        Some words have special meaning:
        
        - ``list``: list local languages
        - ``remote_list``: list remote languages
        - ``install``: install a language
        - ``update``: update local languages
        
        A language dictionnary is a file with one word per line, without accents,
        hyphens or special chars. Local dictionnaries are stored in
        ``~/.crosswords/dicts``. Remote ones are on my website.
        
        Languages
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        Here are the currently available languages. You can install any of them with
        ``crosswords install <language>``.
        
        - English (``english``):  `70k words`_
        - French (``french``): 300k words
