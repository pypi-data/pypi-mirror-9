"""Connection configuration
===========================

.. highlight:: ini

Every sparkplug instance is attached to a single ``connection``, usually
named ``main``. The connection contains all the information necessary to
connect to a single AMQP broker.

The simplest possible connection is::

    [connection:main]

which is equivalent to::

    [connection:main]
    # The host (or host:port) of the broker node to connect to.
    host = localhost
    # The virtual host to connect to.
    virtual_host = /
    # The user to connect as.
    userid = guest
    # The user's password.
    password = guest
    # If set, forces the use of SSL to connect to the broker.
    ssl = False
    
Sparkplug operates by starting a connection, then applying all other
configuration directives to it (to set up queues_, exchanges_, bindings_,
and consumers_), then waiting for messages to be delivered.

.. _queues: `Queue configuration`_
.. _exchanges: `Exchange configuration`_
.. _bindings: `Binding configuration`_
.. _consumers: `Consumer configuration`_
