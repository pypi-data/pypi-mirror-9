 <summary>Graphical tool to make photo collage posters</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
   PhotoCollage allows you to create photo collage posters. It assembles the
   input photographs it is given to generate a big poster. Photos are
   automatically arranged to fill the whole poster, then you can change the
   final layout, dimensions, border or swap photos in the generated grid.
   Eventually the final poster image can we saved in any size.
  </p>
  <p>
   The algorithm generates random layouts that place photos while taking
   advantage of all free space. It tries to fill all space while keeping each
   photo as large as possible.

  <p>
   PhotoCollage does more or less the same as many commercial websites do, but
   for free and with open-source code.
