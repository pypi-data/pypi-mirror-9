dirtt is a standalone tool and library used to generate
directory and file structures from xml templates that describe
repeatedly used filesystem layouts such as project structures
or elements therein.

It provides a subclassed implementation of xml.sax.handler ContentHandler
with internal methods that read,parse,render,and execute builds of
user defined XML directory tree templates.
