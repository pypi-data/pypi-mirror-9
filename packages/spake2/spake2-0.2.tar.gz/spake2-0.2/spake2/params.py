# M and N are defined as "randomly chosen elements of the group". It is
# important that nobody knows their discrete log (if your
# parameter-provider picked a secret 'haha' and told you to use
# M=pow(g,haha,p), you couldn't tell that M wasn't randomly chosen, but
# they could then mount an active attack against your PAKE session).
#
# The safe way to choose these is to hash a public string.
