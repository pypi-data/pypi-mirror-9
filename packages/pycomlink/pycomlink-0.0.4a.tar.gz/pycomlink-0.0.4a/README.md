pycomlink
=========

A python toolbox for MW link data processing and rain rate estimation

Installation
------------

`pycomlink` works with Python 2.7 and depends on `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `matplotlib`'s `basemap`. You can install it via pip:

    $ pip install pycomlink

Usage
-----

Here is an IPython notebook showing the [basic workflow](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/cchwala/pycomlink/raw/566962d7c0a16c484d56aec7a0a34b84cc68a27d/notebooks/example_workflow.ipynb)

Status
------
The basic functionality is already working. However, `pycomlink` is currently in ongoing development. Hence, there may be changes to the interface in the future.

Features
--------
 * Easily parse your MW link data and use and object oriented approach to do all the processing
 * Two wet/dry classification methods available
 * Different baseline methods available
 * One wet antenna estimation method available
 * 2D plots using IDW (preliminary version)
