   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. include:: ../README.rst

Usage
=====

Install the software:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install aiowsgi

Launch the server:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ aiowsgi yourmodule:application
    $ aiowsgi -h

You can also use a paste factory

.. code-block:: ini

    [server:main]
    use = egg:aiowsgi

Notice that all options will not work. aiowsgi just use ``waitress`` with a
custom server factory but not all adjustments are implemented.
