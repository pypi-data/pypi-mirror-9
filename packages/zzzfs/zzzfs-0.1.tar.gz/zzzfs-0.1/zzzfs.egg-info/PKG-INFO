Description: ZzzFS: dataset management à la ZFS
        
        
        ZzzFS ("snooze FS") brings a set of ZFS management commands to non-ZFS volumes,
        turning any directory on a traditional filesystem into a zpool-like object.
        Using only the Python standard library, ZzzFS can be useful to, for example,
        test tools that use ZFS functionality on a system lacking real ZFS. Of course,
        ZzzFS misses all of the low-level features underpinning true ZFS volumes:
        checksumming, copy-on-write, etc.
        
        
        Note that this is distinct from the ZFS feature allowing a zpool to be created
        using a regular file as a vdev. ZzzFS translates commands into move/copy/symlink
        operations in the original filesystem; it does not manage blocks in a virtual
        disk.
        
        
        This is a functional work in progress; don't trust any important data to it
        just yet. The test suite covers the following features:
        
        * create/destroy/list "filesystems" and "pools"
        * clone/promote, send/receive, rollback, diff snapshots
        * get/set/inherit attributes
        * pool command history
        
        
        Example usage::
        
          $ zzzpool create mypool /tmp/pool
          $ zzzpool list
          NAME    SIZE    ALLOC   FREE    CAP     HEALTH  ALTROOT
          mypool     -        -      -      -     ONLINE  -
          $ zzzfs create mypool/work
          $ zzzfs create mypool/play
          $ zzzfs snapshot mypool/work@yesterday
          $ zzzfs list -t all
          NAME                    USED    AVAIL   REFER   MOUNTPOINT
          mypool                     -        -       -   /private/tmp/pool/mypool
          mypool/play                -        -       -   /private/tmp/pool/mypool/play
          mypool/work                -        -       -   /private/tmp/pool/mypool/work
          mypool/work@yesterday      -        -       -   -
          $ zzzfs send mypool/work@yesterday | zzzfs receive mypool/more_work
          $ zzzpool history
          History for 'mypool':
          2015-01-13.22:32:38 zzzpool create mypool /tmp/pool
          2015-01-13.22:32:50 zzzfs create mypool/work
          2015-01-13.22:32:53 zzzfs create mypool/play
          2015-01-13.22:32:56 zzzfs snapshot mypool/work@yesterday
          2015-01-13.22:33:48 zzzfs receive mypool/more_work

        Administration Guide (https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26505_01/pdf/E37384.pdf).

        it's only appropriate to pair "snooze" with "cuddle."
