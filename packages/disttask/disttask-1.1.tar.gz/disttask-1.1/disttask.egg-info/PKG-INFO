Description: 
        Disttask is a utility which provides the ability to distribute a task across a fixed number of processes, for better utilization of multiprocessing.
        
        Use it with existing single-threaded/process tools and scripts to take full advantage of your computer's resources.
        
         | Usage: ./disttask [cmd] [concurrent tasks] [argset]
         | Use a %s in [cmd] where you want the args to go. use %d for the pipe number.
        
        
        The application runs at most "concurrent task" # of processes ( good to match total number of processors available to this number - 1 ).
        It captures stdout and stderr to ensure that any output is not intertwined between the applications.
        
        Each command should specify a "%s" to where each argument will go (one argument from @argset per application). "%d" is also available as the pipe number, but may not be very useful.
        
        Example:
        
         | ./disttask "echo %d %s" 3 "this" "is" "some" "text" "blah" "whooptie" "Doo"
         | 0 this
         | 1 is
         | 2 some
         | 0 text
         | 1 blah
         | 2 whooptie
         | 0 Doo
        
        Another Example:
        
        Run pyflakes, using 10 simultanious processes, on all python files in subdirectories (requires shopt -s globstar. Notice the backticks, not single-quotes.)
        
         | ./disttask "pyflakes %s" 10 `echo **/*.py`
