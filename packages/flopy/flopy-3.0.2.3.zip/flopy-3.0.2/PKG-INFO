Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        *FloPy3* includes support for MODFLOW-2000, MODFLOW-2005, and
        MODFLOW-NWT. Other supported MODFLOW-based models include MODPATH
        (version 6), MT3D and SEAWAT.
        
        FloPy3 Changes
        --------------
        
        *FloPy3* is significantly different from *FloPy2* (hosted on
        `googlecode <https://code.google.com/p/flopy/>`__). The main changes
        are:
        
        -  *FloPy3* is fully zero-based. This means that layers, rows and
           columns start counting at *zero*. The reason for this is consistency.
           Arrays are zero-based by default in Python, so it was confusing to
           have a mix.
        -  Input for packages that take *layer, row, column, data* input (like
           the wel or ghb package) has changed and is much more flexible now.
           See the notebook
           `flopy3boundaries <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/basic/flopy3boundaries.ipynb>`__
        -  Support for use of EXTERNAL and OPEN/CLOSE array specifiers has been
           improved.
        -  *load()* methods have been developed for all of the standard MODFLOW
           packages and a few less used packages (*e.g.* SWI2).
        -  MODFLOW parameter support has been added to the *load()* methods.
           MULT, PVAL, and ZONE packages are now supported and parameter data
           are converted to arrays in the *load()* methods. MODFLOW parameters
           are not supported in *write()* methods. MULT package FUNCTION and
           EXPRESSION functionality are not currently supported.

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Documentation for *FloPy3* is a work in progress. *FloPy3* code
        documentation is available at:

        IPython Notebook Examples
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The following IPython Notebooks contain example FloPy scripts for a
        variety of models and FloPy features
        
        Basic examples
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

           example <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/basic/lake_example.ipynb>`__,
           a very simple *FloPy3* example of steady flow in a square model with
           a fixed head cell in the middle (representing a lake) in a 10-layer
           model.
        -  An overview of the options to enter *layer,row,column,data* values
           for packages such as the wel and ghb packages is given in the
           `flopy3boundaries <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/basic/flopy3boundaries.ipynb>`__
