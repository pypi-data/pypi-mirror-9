Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        *FloPy3* includes support for MODFLOW-2000, MODFLOW-2005, and
        MODFLOW-NWT. Other supported MODFLOW-based models include MODPATH
        (version 6), MT3D and SEAWAT.
        
        For general modeling issues, please consult a modeling forum, such as
        the `MODFLOW Users
        Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/modflow>`__. Other
        MODFLOW resources are listed at the bottom of this page in the MODFLOW
        Resources section.
        
        If you think you have found a bug in *FloPy3*, or if you would like to
        suggest an improvement or enhancement, please submit a new Issue through
        the Github Issue tracker toward the upper-right corner of this page.
        
        FloPy3 Changes
        --------------
        
        Version 3.1
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  *FloPy3* now supports some simple mapping and cross-section
           capabilities through the flopy.plot submodule. See the notebook
           `flopy3\_MapExample <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_MapExample.ipynb>`__.
        
        -  Full support for all Output Control (OC) options including
           DDREFERENCE, SAVE IBOUND, and layer lists. All Output Control Input
           is specified using words. Output Control Input using numeric codes is
           still available in the ModflowOc88 class. The ModflowOc88 class is
           currently deprecated and no longer actively maintained.
        
        -  Added support for standard MULT package FUNCTION and EXPRESSION
           functionality are supported. MODFLOW parameters are not supported in
           *write()* methods.
        
        Version 3.0
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        *FloPy3* is significantly different from *FloPy2* (previously hosted on
        `googlecode <https://code.google.com/p/flopy/>`__). The main changes
        are:
        
        -  *FloPy3* is fully zero-based. This means that layers, rows and
           columns start counting at *zero*. The reason for this is consistency.
           Arrays are zero-based by default in Python, so it was confusing to
           have a mix.
        
        -  Input for packages that take *layer, row, column, data* input (like
           the wel or ghb package) has changed and is much more flexible now.
           See the notebook
           `flopy3boundaries <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3boundaries.ipynb>`__
        
        -  Input for the MT3DMS Source/Sink Mixing (SSM) Package has been
           modified to be consistent with the new MODFLOW boundary package input
           and is more flexible than previous versions of *FloPy*. See the
           notebook
           `flopy3ssm <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_multi-component_SSM.ipynb>`__
        
        -  Support for use of EXTERNAL and OPEN/CLOSE array specifiers has been
           improved.
        
        -  *load()* methods have been developed for all of the standard MODFLOW
           packages and a few less used packages (*e.g.* SWI2).
        
        -  MODFLOW parameter support has been added to the *load()* methods.
           MULT, PVAL, and ZONE packages are now supported and parameter data
           are converted to arrays in the *load()* methods. MODFLOW parameters
           are not supported in *write()* methods.
