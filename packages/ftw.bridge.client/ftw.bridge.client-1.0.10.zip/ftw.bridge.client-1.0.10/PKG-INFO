Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The ``ftw.bridge`` tools are used for communication between several Plone
        instances.
        It is also possible to communicate with other web services.
        Requests between web services are proxied through the `ftw.bridge.proxy`_.
        This makes it possible to move or reconfigure certain dependent webservices
        (clients) only by reconfiguring the proxy.
        The clients do not know where other target clients are located - they only
        communicate with the proxy directly, which forwards the requests to the
        target client.

        Features
        --------
        
        ``ftw.bridge.client`` integrates ``ftw.bridge`` support into Plone.
        It provides tools and utilities for communication and authentication.
        
        - **Authentication**: A PAS plugin authenticates requests and logs the user
          in on the target client without transmitting his password. Only requests
          from the configured `ftw.bridge.proxy`_ are authenticated.
        
        - **Requests**: The ``IBridgeRequest`` utility is used for making requesting
          other clients. It is also able to make remote catalog queries and
          transmitting the result brains to the sources by using fake brains.
        
        - **Brain transport**: By using a ``BrainRepresentation`` it is possible to
          get brains from a remote client. A ``BrainSerializer`` utility serializes
          and deserializes all brain metadata so that they can be used on the source
          client.
        
        - **Watcher portlet**: A recently-modified portlet can be used for generic
          listing a list of recently modified objects on the remote client but it
          is also possible to list other links. There is a browser view ``@@watch``
          which creates a recently-modified portlet on the remote client
          ``dashboard``. The watcher portlet loads its data asynchronously using
          javascript for not blocking while loading the dashboard.
        
        - **Favorites**: A browser view ``@@remote-add-favorite`` adds the context
          to the favorites on the remote client ``dashboard``.
        
        
        Installation and configuration
        ------------------------------
        
        - A installation of `ftw.bridge.proxy`_ is required.
        
        - Add ``ftw.bridge.client`` to your eggs in the buildout configuration::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                ftw.bridge.client
        
        - Configure the `ftw.bridge.proxy`_ data as environment variables::
        
            [instance]
            environment-vars +=
                bridge_url http://localhost:1234/proxy
                bridge_ips 127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.10
                bridge_client_id workspace
        
        - Install the generic setup profile. This registers the portlet and installs
          a PAS plugin.
        
        
        Configuration Options
        ---------------------
        
        The configuration options are set using environment variables:
        
        - ``bridge_url``: The url to the "/proxy" view of `ftw.bridge.proxy`_.
        - ``bridge_ips``: A comma seperated list of trusted IPs of the
          `ftw.bridge.proxy`_ installation.
        - ``bridge_client_id``: The id of this client as configured in the ``.ini``
          file on ``ftw.bridge.proxy``.
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Runs with `Plone <http://www.plone.org/>`_ `4.1`, `4.2` or `4.3`.
