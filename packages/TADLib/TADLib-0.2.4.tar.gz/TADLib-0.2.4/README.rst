Introduction
------------
Chromosome conformation capture (3C) derived techniques, especially Hi-C,
have revealed that topologically associating domain (TAD) is a structural
basis for both chromatin organization and regulation in three-dimensional
(3D) space. To systematically investigate the relationship between structure
and function, it is important to develop a quantitative parameter to measure
the structural characteristics of TAD. TADLib is such a package to explore
the chromatin interaction pattern of TAD.

Inspired by the observation that there exist great differences in chromatin
interaction pattern and gene expression level among TADs, a chromatin interaction
feature called Aggregation Preference (AP) is developed to capture the aggregation
degree of long-range chromatin interactions. Application to human and mouse cell
lines (including both traditional Hi-C and in situ Hi-C datasets) shows that there
exist heterogeneous structures among TADs and the structural rearrangement across
cell lines is significantly associated with transcription activity remodelling.

TADLib package is written in Python and provides a three-step pipeline:

- Selecting long-range chromatin interactions in each TAD
- Finding aggregation patterns of selected interactions
- Calculating chromatin interaction feature of TAD

Notes
-----
By default, we suppose that the input Hi-C data are corrected appropriately.
Otherwise, systematic biases in source data will negatively impact chromatin
interaction selection and then parameter calculation. Several correction schemes
are available online:
