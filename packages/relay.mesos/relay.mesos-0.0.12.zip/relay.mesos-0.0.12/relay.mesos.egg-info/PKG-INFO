Summary: A plugin for Relay that lets you run Relay on Mesos to auto-scale the number of concurrently running instances of a bash command.  Generally, Relay lets you minimize the difference between a metric and a target timeseries. 

Generally good for auto-scaling workers.  Similar to Marathon, but designed for applications that exit often or need to be auto-scaled using Relay's algorithm
