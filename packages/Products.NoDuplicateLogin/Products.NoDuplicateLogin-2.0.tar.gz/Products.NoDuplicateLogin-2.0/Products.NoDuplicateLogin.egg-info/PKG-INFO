        Introduction
        ============
        
        This PAS plugin will reject multiple logins with the same user at the same
        time. It ensures that only one browser may be logged with the same userid at
        one time.
        
        Implementation
        --------------
        
        The implementation works like this: Suppose that Anna and Karl are two people
        who share a login annaandkarl in our site. Anna logs in, authenticating for
        the first time. We generate a cookie with a unique id for Anna and remember
        the id ourselves. For every subsequent authentication (i.e. for every
        request), we will make sure that Anna's browser has the cookie.
        
        Now Karl decides to log in into the site with the same login annaandkarl, the
        one that Anna uses to surf the site right now. The plugin sees that Karl's
        browser doesn't have our cookie yet, so it generates one with a unique id for
        Karl's browser, remembers it and forgets about Anna's cookie.
        
        What happens when Anna clicks on a link on the site? The plugin sees that Anna
        has our cookie but that it differs from the cookie value that it remembered
        (Karl's browser has that cookie value). Anna is logged out but the plugin and
        sees the message "Someone else logged in under your name".
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        This product, when active, will automatically prevent users from staying logged
        in if they attempt to open a second session. This works well for all
        authentication schemes that have a concept of ``credential reset``, but for
        users logged in with Basic Auth this will not work as expected, and both
        sessions will interfere with eachother without one being permanently ended.
        This is a limitation of the Basic Auth technology, so we recommend not using
        this plugin in combination with Basic Auth sites.
        
        This plugin also provides a ``revoke_session`` view on itself, which can be
        accessed by visiting
        ``http://www.example.com/acl_users/no_duplicate_login/revoke_session``, which
        can be used by site administrators to manually invoke the forced logout
        mechanism.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add ``Products.NoDuplicateLogin`` to the eggs parameter of your ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``
        section::
        
            [plone]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            eggs =
                Plone
                ...
                Products.NoDuplicateLogin
        
        Now run buildout and restart Plone. Once Plone has started, login and browse to
        ``Site Setup -> Zope Management Interface -> acl_users`` and add a ``No
        Duplicate Login Plugin`` from the drop down menu in the upper right.
        
        After that, click on the ``No Duplicate Login Plugin`` object in the acl_users
        folder listing. For each of the ``Authentication``, ``Credential Update`` and
        ``Reset Credentials`` objects in the ``No Duplicate Login Plugin`` folder
        listing, click, then move the ``no_duplicate_login`` plugin from the
        ``Available Plugins`` display widget on the left to the ``Active Plugins``
        display widget on the right using the arrow buttons in the middle.
        
        It you will also need to "arrow up" the ``no_duplicate_login`` plugin in the
        ``Active Plugins`` display listing for both ``Authentication`` and ``Reset
        Credentials``.
        
        If you are using a policy product to install this as part of your deployment
        you can perform these actions by including an empty ``noduplicatelogin.xml``
        file in your profile directory.
