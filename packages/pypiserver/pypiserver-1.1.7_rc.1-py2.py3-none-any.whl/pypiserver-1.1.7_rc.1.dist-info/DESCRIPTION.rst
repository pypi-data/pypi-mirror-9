*pypiserver* is a minimal PyPI_ compatible server. It can be used to
upload and serve a set of packages, wheels and eggs to *pip* or
*easy_install*.


Installation and Usage/Quickstart
=================================
*pypiserver* will work with python 2.5 --> 2.7 and 3.2 --> 3.4. Python
3.0 and 3.1 may also work, but pypiserver is not being tested with
these versions.

Run the following commands to get your PyPI server up and running::

  ## Installation.
  pip install pypiserver
  mkdir ~/packages          ## Copy packages/wheels/eggs to this directory.

  ## Start server.
  pypi-server -p 8080 ~/packages &

  ## Install hosted packages.
  pip install  --extra-index-url http://localhost:8080/simple/ ...


You can even install the latest *pypiserver* directly from github with this command,
assuming you have *git* installed on your `PATH`::

  pip install git+git://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver.git

.. Note::
  The above commands do work on an unix like operating system with a
  posix shell. If you're using windows, you'll have to run their
  'windows counterparts'. The same is true for the rest of this
  documentation.


Alternative Installation as standalone script
=============================================
The git repository contains a ``pypi-server-standalone.py`` script,
which is a single python file ready to be executed without any other
dependencies.

Run the following commands to download the script with `wget`::

  wget https://raw.github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver/standalone/pypi-server-standalone.py
  chmod +x pypi-server-standalone.py

or with `curl`::

  curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver/standalone/pypi-server-standalone.py
  chmod +x pypi-server-standalone.py

The server can then be started with::

  ./pypi-server-standalone.py

Feel free to rename the script and move it into your $PATH.


Running on heroku/dotcloud
=================================
https://github.com/dexterous/pypiserver-on-the-cloud contains
instructions on how to run pypiserver on one of the supported cloud
service providers.


Detailed Usage
=================================
pypi-server -h will print a detailed usage message::

  pypi-server [OPTIONS] [PACKAGES_DIRECTORY...]
    start PyPI compatible package server serving packages from
    PACKAGES_DIRECTORY. If PACKAGES_DIRECTORY is not given on the
    command line, it uses the default ~/packages.  pypiserver scans this
    directory recursively for packages. It skips packages and
    directories starting with a dot. Multiple package directories can be
    specified.

  pypi-server understands the following options:

    -p, --port PORT
      listen on port PORT (default: 8080)

    -i, --interface INTERFACE
      listen on interface INTERFACE (default: 0.0.0.0, any interface)

    -a, --authenticate (UPDATE|download|list), ...
      comma-separated list of (case-insensitive) actions to authenticate
      (requires giving also the -P option). For example to password-protect 
      package uploads & downloads while leaving listings public, give: 
        -a update,download.
      If unspecified, only 'update' is password-protected.

    -P, --passwords PASSWORD_FILE
      use apache htpasswd file PASSWORD_FILE to set usernames & passwords
      used for authentication of certain actions (see -a option).

    --disable-fallback
      disable redirect to real PyPI index for packages not found in the
      local index

    --fallback-url FALLBACK_URL
      for packages not found in the local index, this URL will be used to
      redirect to (default: http://pypi.python.org/simple)

    --server METHOD
      use METHOD to run the server. Valid values include paste,
      cherrypy, twisted, gunicorn, gevent, wsgiref, auto. The
      default is to use "auto" which chooses one of paste, cherrypy,
      twisted or wsgiref.

    -r, --root PACKAGES_DIRECTORY
      [deprecated] serve packages from PACKAGES_DIRECTORY

    -o, --overwrite
      allow overwriting existing package files

    --welcome HTML_FILE
      uses the ASCII contents of HTML_FILE as welcome message response.

    -v
      enable INFO logging;  repeate for more verbosity.

    --log-conf <FILE>
      read logging configuration from FILE.
      By default, configuration is read from `log.conf` if found in server's dir.

    --log-file <FILE>
      write logging info into this FILE.

    --log-frmt <FILE>
      the logging format-string.  (see `logging.LogRecord` class from standard python library)
      [Default: %(asctime)s|%(levelname)s|%(thread)d|%(message)s] 

    --log-req-frmt FORMAT
      a format-string selecting Http-Request properties to log; set to  '%s' to see them all.
      [Default: %(bottle.request)s] 

    --log-res-frmt FORMAT
      a format-string selecting Http-Response properties to log; set to  '%s' to see them all.
      [Default: %(status)s]

    --log-err-frmt FORMAT
      a format-string selecting Http-Error properties to log; set to  '%s' to see them all.
      [Default: %(body)s: %(exception)s \n%(traceback)s]

  pypi-server -h
  pypi-server --help
    show this help message

  pypi-server --version
    show pypi-server's version

  pypi-server -U [OPTIONS] [PACKAGES_DIRECTORY...]
    update packages in PACKAGES_DIRECTORY. This command searches
    pypi.python.org for updates and shows a pip command line which
    updates the package.

  The following additional options can be specified with -U:

    -x
      execute the pip commands instead of only showing them

    -d DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY
      download package updates to this directory. The default is to use
      the directory which contains the latest version of the package to
      be updated.

    -u
      allow updating to unstable version (alpha, beta, rc, dev versions)

  Visit https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypiserver for more information.



Configuring pip/easy_install
============================
Always specifying the the pypi url on the command line is a bit
cumbersome. Since pypi-server redirects pip/easy_install to the
pypi.python.org index if it doesn't have a requested package, it's a
good idea to configure them to always use your local pypi index.

`pip`
-----
For *pip* this can be done by setting the environment variable
`PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` in your `.bashrc`/`.profile`/`.zshrc`::

  export PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=http://localhost:8080/simple/

or by adding the following lines to ~/.pip/pip.conf::

  [global]
  extra-index-url = http://localhost:8080/simple/

.. Note::
    If you have installed *pypi-server* on a remote url without *https* 
    you wil receive an "untrusted" warning from `pip`, urging you to append
    the '--trusted-host` option.  You can include this option permanently
    in your configuration-files or environment variables.

`easy_install`
--------------
For *easy_install* it can be configured with the following setting in
`~/.pydistutils.cfg`::

  [easy_install]
  index_url = http://localhost:8080/simple/


Uploads via `setup.py` upload
=============================
Uploading packages via ``python setup.py upload`` is also
possible. First make sure you have the *passlib* module installed::

  pip install passlib

Then create a apache *htpassword* file with::

  htpasswd -sc .htaccess myusername

You'll be prompted for a password. You'll need to restart the server
with the `-P` option::

  pypi-server -p 8080 -P /path/to/.htaccess /path/to/private_pypi_folder/

Edit or create a `~/.pypirc` file with the following content::

  [distutils]
  index-servers =
    pypi
    internal

  [pypi]
  username:pypiusername
  password:pypipasswd

  [internal]
  repository: http://127.0.0.1:8080
  username: myusername
  password: mypasswd

Uploading then works by running::

  python setup.py sdist upload -r internal


Managing the package directory
==============================
The `pypi-server` command has the `-U` option that searches for updates of
available packages. It scans the package directory for available
packages and searches on pypi.python.org for updates. Without further
options ``pypi-server -U`` will just print a list of commands which must
be run in order to get the latest version of each package. Output
looks like::

   $ ./pypi-server -U
  checking 106 packages for newer version

  .........u.e...........e..u.............
  .....e..............................e...
  ..........................

  no releases found on pypi for PyXML, Pymacs, mercurial, setuptools

  # update raven from 1.4.3 to 1.4.4
  pip -q install --no-deps  --extra-index-url http://pypi.python.org/simple -d /home/ralf/packages/mirror raven==1.4.4

  # update greenlet from 0.3.3 to 0.3.4
  pip -q install --no-deps  --extra-index-url http://pypi.python.org/simple -d /home/ralf/packages/mirror greenlet==0.3.4

It first prints for each package a single character after checking the
available versions on pypi. A dot(`.`) means the package is up-to-date, `u`
means the package can be updated and `e` means the list of releases on
pypi is empty. After that it shows a *pip* command line which can be used
to update a one package. Either copy and paste that or run
``pypi-server -Ux`` in order to really execute those commands. You need
to have *pip* installed for that to work however.

Specifying an additional `-u` option will also allow alpha, beta and
release candidates to be downloaded. Without this option these
releases won't be considered.


Optional dependencies
=====================
*pypiserver* relies on the *passlib* module for parsing apache htpasswd
files. You need to install it, when using the `-P`, `--passwords`
option. The following command will do that::

  pip install passlib


Using a different WSGI server
=============================
- *pypiserver* ships with it's own copy of bottle. 
  It's possible to use bottle with different WSGI servers. 

- *pypiserver* chooses any of the
  following *paste*, *cherrypy*, *twisted*, *wsgiref* (part of python) if
  available.

- If none of the above servers matches your needs, pypiserver also
  exposes an API to get the internal WSGI app, which you can then run
  under any WSGI server you like. `pypiserver.app` has the following
  interface::

    def app(root=None,
	    redirect_to_fallback=True,
	    fallback_url="http://pypi.python.org/simple")

  and returns the WSGI application. `root` is the package directory,
  `redirect_to_fallback` specifies whether to redirect to `fallback_url` when
  a package is missing.


gunicorn
--------

The following command uses *gunicorn* to start *pypiserver*::

  gunicorn -w4 'pypiserver:app("/home/ralf/packages")'

or when using multiple roots::

  gunicorn -w4 'pypiserver:app(["/home/ralf/packages", "/home/ralf/experimental"])'


apache/mod_wsgi
---------------
In case you're using *apache2* with *mod_wsgi*, the following config-file
(contributed by Thomas Waldmann) can be used::

  # An example pypiserver.wsgi for use with apache2 and mod_wsgi, edit as necessary.
  #
  # apache virtualhost configuration for mod_wsgi daemon mode:
  #    Alias /robots.txt /srv/yoursite/htdocs/robots.txt
  #    WSGIPassAuthorization On
  #    WSGIScriptAlias /     /srv/yoursite/cfg/pypiserver.wsgi
  #    WSGIDaemonProcess     pypisrv user=pypisrv group=pypisrv processes=1 threads=5 maximum-requests=500 umask=0007 display-name=wsgi-pypisrv inactivity-timeout=300
  #    WSGIProcessGroup      pypisrv

  PACKAGES = "/srv/yoursite/packages"
  HTPASSWD = "/srv/yoursite/htpasswd"
  import pypiserver
  application = pypiserver.app(PACKAGES, redirect_to_fallback=True, password_file=HTPASSWD)


paste/pastedeploy
-----------------
*paste* allows to run multiple WSGI applications under different URL
paths. Therefore it's possible to serve different set of packages on
different paths.

The following example `paste.ini` could be used to serve stable and
unstable packages on different paths::

  [composite:main]
  use = egg:Paste#urlmap
  /unstable/ = unstable
  / = stable

  [app:stable]
  use = egg:pypiserver#main
  root = ~/stable-packages

  [app:unstable]
  use = egg:pypiserver#main
  root = ~/stable-packages
	 ~/unstable-packages

  [server:main]
  use = egg:gunicorn#main
  host = 0.0.0.0
  port = 9000
  workers = 5
  accesslog = -

.. Note::
  You need to install some more dependencies for this to work,
  e.g. run::

    pip install paste pastedeploy gunicorn pypiserver

  The server can then be started with::

    gunicorn_paster paste.ini

Bugs
====
*pypiserver* does not implement the full API as seen on PyPI_. It
implements just enough to make *easy_install* and *pip* install work.

The following limitations are known:

- It doesn't implement the XMLRPC interface: pip search
  will not work.
- It doesn't implement the json based '/pypi' interface.
- It accepts documentation uploads but does not save them to
  disk (see https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver/issues/47 for a
  discussion)
- It does not handle misspelled packages as pypi-repo does,
  therefore it is suggested to use it with `--extra-index-url` instead
  of `--index-url` (see discussion at https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver/issues/38)

Please use github's `bugtracker <https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver/issues>`_ 
if you find any other bugs.
