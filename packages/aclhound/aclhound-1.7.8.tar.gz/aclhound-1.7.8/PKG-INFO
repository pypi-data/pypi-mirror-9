        Summary
        -------
        
        ACLHound takes as input policy language following a variant of the [AFPL2] [1]
        syntax and compiles a representation specific for the specified vendor which
        can be deployed on firewall devices.

        Design goals
        ------------
        
        ACLHound is designed to assist humans in managing hundreds of ACLs across 
        tens of devices. One key focus point is maximum re-usability of ACL 
        components such as groups of hosts, groups of ports and the policies 
        themselves.
        
        Supported devices 
        -----------------
        
        * Cisco ASA
            * No support for ASA 9.1.2 or higher (yet)
        * Cisco IOS
            * Will autodetect IPv6 support through ```show ipv6 cef```
        * Juniper (planned)
