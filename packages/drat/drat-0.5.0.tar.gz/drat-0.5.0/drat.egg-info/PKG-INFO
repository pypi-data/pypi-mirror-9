Description: Drat
        ====
        
        Text (readability) analysis tool written in Python (2.7 and 3).
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Drat is a tool that analyzes reading texts and produces a brief report
        which provides the following information:
        
        - the Dale-Chall readability score.
        - the Coleman-Liau Readability Index.
        - the number of uncommon words (based on the General Service List).
        - a list of all of these uncommon words (if you choose the verbose option).
        
        
        Drat supports **docx**, **odt**, **ods**, **odp** files as well as text
        files and urls.
        
        You can also analyze multiple texts / links by creating a text file
        with the filenames / links written in it.
        
        A simple example of how drat can be used in a web application is provided in the
        webapp directory.
