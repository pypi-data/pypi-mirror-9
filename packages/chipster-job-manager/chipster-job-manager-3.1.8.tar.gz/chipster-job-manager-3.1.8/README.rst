===================
Chipster JobManager
===================

Chipster JobManager provides capabilities to move the Chipster job management
responsibility away from clients to remote Chipster JobManager service. When
JobManager is in use, the Chipster clients can start a job execution, save the
session state locally and disconnect. Job is then executed on Chipster analysis
servers and managed by the JobManager, which saves the results upon completion
and reschedules the job in case the execution fails.
