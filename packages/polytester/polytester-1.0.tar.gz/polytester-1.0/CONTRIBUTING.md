This is a first pass at a contribution doc, and will change, but for starters:

- Incoming code should follow PEP8
- If you add new core-level features, write some quick docs in the README.  If you're not sure if they're needed, just ask!
- Add your name and attribution to the AUTHORS file.
- Know you have our thanks for helping to make will even better!
