Description: User and group management
        =========================
        
        ``node.ext.ugm`` provides an API for node based managing of users and groups.
        
        See ``node.ext.ugm.interfaces`` for a description of the API.
        
        A file based default implementation can be found at ``node.ext.ugm.file``.
        
        Base objects for writing UGM implementations can be found at
        ``node.ext.ugm._api``.
        
        For more information on nodes see `node <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/node>`_
        package.
        
        For more information on plumbing see
        `plumber <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plumber>`_ package.
