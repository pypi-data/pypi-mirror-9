Relation
--------
A python class implementing a discrete, mathematical relationship.  Supports all cardinalities:

- 1:1
- 1:M (and its inverse M:1)
- M:M (or M:N if you insist)

Useful for all manners of invertible container goodness, including:

- aliasing (1:1)
- tagging (M:M)
- partitioning (1:M)
- assignment (M:1)
