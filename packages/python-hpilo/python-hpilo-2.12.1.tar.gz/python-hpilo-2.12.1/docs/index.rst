Accessing HP iLO interfaces from python
=======================================

This module will make it easy for you to access the Integrated Lights Out
management interface of your HP hardware. It supports RILOE II, iLO, iLO 2, iLO
3 and iLO 4. It uses the XML interface or hponcfg to access and change the iLO.

The complete API is described in the :doc:`iLO class API reference </ilo>`. All
functions return structured data based on the XML returned by the iLO. See
:doc:`the output reference </output>` for example return values.

A command line interface to this module, :doc:`hpilo_cli </cli>` makes accessing iLO
interfaces almost trivial and easy to integrate with non-python scripts.

To make managing SSL certificates for iLO boards easier, you can use
:doc:`hpilo_ca </ca>`.

HP, Integrated Lights out and iLO are trademarks of HP, with whom the author of
this software is not affiliated in any way other than using some of their
hardware.
