This file was created to explain some peculiarities of repositories used by the slpkg.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Default repositories:
---------------------
SlackBuilds.org (sbo) FAQ(15): 
Slackware current is not supported, but as a general rule, the scripts
should work on it as well.

Rworkman's (rlw) repository use dependencies where displayed in central site 
'http://rlworkman.net/pkgs/' and only those. Unfortunately there is no fixed reference
dependencies file PACKAGES.TXT.

Slackers.it (slackr) repository must be used only from Slackware64 current users.
Also find in some packages will not show package description when you run the command
'slpkg -p slackr <package>' and this is because there is not constant reference to the
description of the file 'PACKAGES.TXT' as in other repositories. Some packages reference
dependencies not included in the repository. This can be checked if you run the command
'slpkg -t slackr <package>'. (Example: noticed that the package 'digikam' indicate 
dependence 'ffmpeg' but that is not available from the repository itself).

Studioware (studio), Alien's ktown (ktown), Alien's multilib (multi), Slacke E17 and E18
and Alien's restricted repository has no reference dependencies.

Slackel.gr (slackl) repository must be used only from Slackware current users and has the
same peculiarities in the repository 'slackr'.


Custom repositories:
--------------------
There is the possibility of adding the repository directly from the user enough to address
up to be the 'PACKAGES.TXT' files and 'CHECKSUMS.md5' least. If not is there for file 
'ChangeLog.txt' will get warning messages that the 'ChangeLog.txt' file can not be read but do
not worry, the process is completed normally have each time you run the command 'slpkg update'
the package lists for such a repository will be recreated from start automatically.

Sometimes you may experience some problems with these repositories such as the not correctly
resolve dependencies, and this may happen some specificities separate list which unfortunately
can not be calculated, good is the purpose of mentioning these problems.
