        This library contains the HTTP/2 framing code used in the `hyper`_ project. It
        provides a pure-Python codebase that is capable of decoding a binary stream
        into HTTP/2 frames.
        
        This library is used directly by `hyper`_ and a number of other projects to
        provide HTTP/2 frame decoding logic.
