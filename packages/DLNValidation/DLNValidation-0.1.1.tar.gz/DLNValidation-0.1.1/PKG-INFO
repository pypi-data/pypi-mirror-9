        =============
        
        A python library for validation of USA drivers license numbers.
        Dl-number-validation validates if a drivers license is a valid format for the two letter postal code for the state.
        
        Formats are defined by http://adr-inc.com/PDFs/State_DLFormats.pdf
        
        Installation
        ============
        `pip install DLNValidation`
        
        Usage
        =====
        Typical usage often looks like this::
        
            from dl_number_validation import is_valid
        
            if is_valid('C1234567', 'CA'):
                print "Your drivers license number is valid! Yay!"
        
        If you want US territories to be used for validation call `is_valid` with `allow_territories=True`. Be warned, currently these additional territories accept any format of drivers license.
