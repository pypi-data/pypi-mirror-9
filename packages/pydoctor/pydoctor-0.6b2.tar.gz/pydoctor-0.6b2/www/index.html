        What is pydoctor?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          It is an API documentation tool for Python, somewhat
          like <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">Epydoc</a>,
          Pudge (now defunct),
          <a href="http://www.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/EndoHowTo">Endo</a>
          or <a href="http://happydoc.sourceforge.net/">HappyDoc</a>.
        </p>

        Why?

          pydoctor was written to be used by
          the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a> project which was
          using <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">epydoc</a> but was becoming
          increasingly
          <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-web/2006-January/002406.html">
          unhappy</a> with it for various reasons.  In addition, development on Epydoc
          seemed to have halted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to use most of the tools listed above; Pudge crashed, Endo seemed to
          depend on the <em>enormous</em> Enthought package and HappyDoc is to all
          appearances dead as a door-nail.  So, when I had a long-ish journey to make I
          started coding, and a week or so of evenings later with some help from
          Christopher Armstrong and a few others, had something that was actually useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The needs of the twisted project are still the main driving force for pydoctor's
          development, but it is getting to the point where there's some chance that it is
          useful for your project too.
        </p>

      <dt>
        Why would I use it?  How is it different from Epydoc, pudge, etc?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          pydoctor is probably best suited to documenting a library with a some degree of
          internal subclassing.  It also has support for
          <a href="http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface">zope.interface</a>, and can
          recognise interfaces and classes which implement such interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          pydoctor works by parsing the source code and processing the syntax trees.  This
          has advantages and disadvantages relative to inspecting objects, as Epydoc 2
          does.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not especially interested in promoting pydoctor as the be all and end all of
          API documentation generation.  It works for me and it works for Twisted.  Maybe
          it works for you too.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current (spare time) hacking plans move pydoctor in two directions that
          AFAIK other documentation generations tools do not go: using
          <a href="http://onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/">Unobtrusive
          JavaScript</a> to add a level of dynamism to the documentation (sorting methods
          by line number or method name, for example) and an appserver variant that
          allows users of the documentation to edit docstrings online.

        Who wrote it?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Michael "mwhudson" Hudson, PyPy, Launchpad and sometimes
          Twisted hacker, with help from Christopher "radix" Armstrong
          and Jonathan "jml" Lange and advice and ideas from many
          people who hang out in #twisted on freenode.

        Where do I get it?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          I still haven't made any proper releases yet, so you have to
          get it from Launchpad
          using <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org">Bazaar</a>:
        </p>
        <pre>
          bzr get <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~mwhudson/pydoctor/dev">lp:pydoctor</a> pydoctor
        </pre>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        How do I use it?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          This is a big enough topic to deserve its <a href="usage.html">own page</a>.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        What does the output look like?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          It looks <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/">like this</a>,
          which is the Twisted API documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The output is reasonably simple, clean HTML (it validates!) created from Twisted
          templates and styled with CSS, so while there's no flexibility in the code yet,
          it would probably not be that hard to add (this is how pydoctor has been
          developed in general: rather than try and predict what will be useful, I've
          tried to keep things reasonably clean and separate to allow rapid
          implementations of requested features.  It seems to be working, so far).
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Where do I report bugs?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          On <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/pydoctor">Launchpad</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, if it's daytime in New Zealand, turning up in #twisted
          and hassling mwhudson works reasonably well.
