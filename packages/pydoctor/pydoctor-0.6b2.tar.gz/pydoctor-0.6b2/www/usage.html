    <h1>using pydoctor</h1>
    <p>
      The basic idea of pydoctor is that it examines source code and produces html that
      describes that source code.  It does this using a command line tool which has a
      rather large number of options (although once you've worked out which ones you want
      you can put them in a config file).
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest invocation is "<tt>pydoctor
      /path/to/a/package </tt>".  This will produce html in a
      directory called "<tt>apidocs</tt>" in the current working directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn more, read the output of "<tt>pydoctor --help</tt>" and look at the example
      <tt>twisted.cfg</tt> files that are in the pydoctor source.  Or read the source.  Or
      wait for me to write more of this web page.  Or write it for me :-)
