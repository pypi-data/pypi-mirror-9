HTML Formatter:

  - show function signatures for functions in "children" tables
  - Do something more useful with Interface information
    - blue boxes for interface docstrings in implementation methods?
    - work out a sensible way to display deeper interface information.
  - Parameterise epydoc usage instead of just basing on presence of epydoc
  - Make Pretty

Model:

  - sanitize the model of tracking interface implementations wrt
    inheritance
  - think fairly hard about how robust the code is -- we should
    *never* crash out.
  - understand import * from a package
  - the package.contents vs package.contents['__init__'].contents
    thing is getting out of hand.  really really really.

General:

  - sort out a consistent verbosity story. getting somewhere with this.
