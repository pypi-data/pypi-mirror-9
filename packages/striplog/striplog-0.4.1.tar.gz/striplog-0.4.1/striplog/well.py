    Well contains everything about the well. It inherits from
    las.LASReader.

    For example, well will contain header fields, curves, and
    other data from the 'basic' LAS file.

    We will then read supplementary LAS files, and/or maybe CSV
    data, into one main other attribute of Well: the striplog.

    If we start using pandas dataframes, this is the place to
    do it.

    Args:
        f (str): The path to an LAS file.
        null_subs (float): Something to substitute for the declared
            null value, which is probably -999.25. Often it's convenient
            to use np.nan.
        unknown_as_other (bool): Whether you'd like to load unknown
            sections as plain text blocks. A hack to cope with LAS3 files
            without having to handle arbitrary sections.

    Note:
        This module is not very general. It was written to support a very
        specific workflow. If it seems to be useful for other things,
        we can come back and try to generalize it.

        Essentially, this entire thing needs to be replaced by Something
        that properly supports the LAS 3.0 format, both reading and writing.
