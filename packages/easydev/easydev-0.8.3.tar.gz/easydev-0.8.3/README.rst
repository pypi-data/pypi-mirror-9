**easydev** is a package I use for the development of other software available on pypi.
It provides utilities that are of general usage for the development of Python packages.
It has been used also as an incubator for other packages (e.g.,
`http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colormap`).


For instance, it provides the sphinx templates being used for this documentation. It is also used by
other packages where documentation using Sphinx is being used (e.g., rtools, 
spectrum). It provides tools such as multisetup (to ease the development of
several packages within a single namespace), or **mulitgit**, a mechanism to get the path of the share 
directory of any package, functions that are used often such as type checking
and so on

Similar projects are pytools, pytoolbox.

For a full documentation, see the sphinx documentation at
`<http://pythonhosted.org/easydev/>`_
