Description: django-superuser
        ================
        At some point in development you wish you were just automatically logged into
        the django admin as a super user. This middleware lets you do just that. As you
        probably understand this also poses a security risk. To minimize the chances of
        this middleware automatically logging someone in as a super user in a
        production environment you will need to take some extra steps when installing.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        First you need enter the middleware in your setting file, it needs to be at
        some line after the
        ``django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware``::
        
            MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
                ...
                'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
                'superuser.middleware.SuperUserMiddleware',
                ...
            )
        
        
        You also need to have your IP listed in ``INTERNAL_IPS``, for example::
        
            INTERNAL_IPS = ('127.0.0.1',)
        
        
        Lastly you need to make sure ``DEBUG = True`` in your settings file for the middleware to work.
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        Note that the login page (usually ``/admin/login/``) does not log you in
        automatically as a super user, this is so that you can login as a different
        user if you like.  If you want to be logged in as a super user, just navigate
        to any other admin view, for example ``/admin/``.
