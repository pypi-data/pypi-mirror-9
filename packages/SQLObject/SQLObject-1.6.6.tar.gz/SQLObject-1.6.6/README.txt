SQLObject 1.6.6
===============

Thanks for looking at SQLObject.  SQLObject is an object-relational
mapper, i.e., a library that will wrap your database tables in Python
classes, and your rows in Python instances.

It currently supports MySQL through the `MySQLdb` package, PostgreSQL
through the `psycopg` package, SQLite, Firebird, MaxDB (SAP DB), MS SQL
Sybase and Rdbhost.  Python 2.5 or higher is required.

For more information please see the documentation in
docs/SQLObject.txt, or online at http://sqlobject.org/
