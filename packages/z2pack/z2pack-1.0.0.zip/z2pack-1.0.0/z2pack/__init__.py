"""
The core module contains the routines that are shared between different \
specialisations of Z2Pack (first-principles, tight-binding), and interfaces \
to those. It contains the classes System (which acts as hook for the \
specialisations) and Surface (responsible for all the calculations / \
plots etc.)
