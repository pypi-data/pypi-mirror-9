QNET contains symbolic algebra packages to handle:
 - quantum operators --> `qnet.algebra.operator_algebra`
 - quantum feedback circuits --> `qnet.algebra.circuit_algebra`
 - quantum super operators --> `qnet.algebra.super_operator_algebra`
 - quantum states --> `qnet.algebra.state_algebra`

It also features a parser for quantum feedback circuits specified
via Quantum Hardware Description Language:

    parse_qhdl.py -f MyCircuit.qhdl [-l|-L]
