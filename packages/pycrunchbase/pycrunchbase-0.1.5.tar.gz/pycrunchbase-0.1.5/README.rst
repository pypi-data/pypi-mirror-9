Python bindings to CrunchBase

Examples
========

::

    # initialize the API using your API Key, will throw ValueError if missing
    cb = CrunchBase(API_KEY)
    # look up an organization by name
    github = cb.organization('github')

    # the response contains snippets of data regarding relationships
    # that the organization has, an example is the funding_rounds
    funding_rounds_summary = github.funding_rounds

    # all relationships are paged, and only 8 is returned initially
    # to get more data do this, it handles paging for you
    # and returns a False-y value if there are no more pages
    more_funding_rounds = cb.more(funding_rounds_summary)

    # data in relations are just summaries, and you probably want more details
    # For example funding_rounds returns 5 values: type, name, path
    # created_at, updated_at.
    # If you actually want to know who invested, you have to get to make
    # more API calls

    # first get the uuid of the round
    round_uuid = funding_rounds_summary[0].uuid

    # then use the CrunchBase API to make that call
    round = cb.funding_round(round_uuid)

    # again, investments is a relationship on a FundingRound,
    # so we can get the first item in that relationship
    an_investor = round.investments[0]  # a InvestorInvestmentPageItem

    # and printing that gives us the name of the investor, and the amount
    # invested in USD
    print(str(an_investor))  # prints: Investor Name $100000


Installation
============

::

    pip install pycrunchbase

Documentation
=============

https://pycrunchbase.readthedocs.org/

Development
===========

To run the all tests run::

    tox

Contributions are always welcome!

Use `GitHub issues <https://github.com/ngzhian/pycrunchbase/issues>`_
to report a bug or send feedback.

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/ngzhian/pycrunchbase/issues.

Goals
=====

1. Support all (or almost all) of CrunchBase's API functionalities
2. Speedy updates when CrunchBase's API changes
3. 'Pythonic' bindings, user doesn't feel like we're requesting URLs


TODO
===========

* Support other nodes (IPO, FundRaise)
* Coerce values in relationships page item to python types (datetime)
* Document our usage of returning None vs NonePageItem or NoneRelationship
