Description: Unique-Sam
        ==========
        
        **Unique-Sam** is a simple command line tool to remove the duplicated
        alignments in the `SAM <https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs>`__ file.
        If the MAPQ field of the alignment is available, *unique-sam* will keep
        one and only one alignment with the highest score. Otherwise,
        *unique-sam* will calculate a score according to the alignment's MD or
        CIGAR field and use the calculated value to remove the duplicated
        alignments.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        -  Install with the source code, in the source folder:
        
           .. code:: bash
        
               python setup.py install
        
        -  If you have `**pip** <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html>`__
           installed, you can simply run
        
           .. code:: bash
        
               pip install unique-sam
        
           After installation you can access **unique-sam** from your command
           line.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        **unique-sam** need a SAM format file to run properly. Before using
        ``unique-sam`` command, we must sort the sam file by the
        ``QNAME``\ field. You can use ``samtools`` to achieve this purpose,
        refer to samtools for more helps:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            samtools sort --help
        
        For basic usage, in your command line environment:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            unique-sam input.sam -o output.sam
        
        -s Parameter
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you don't have access to samtools, you can use **-s** option of
        ``unique-sam``:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            unique-sam -s input.sam -o output.sam
        
        The sort functionality of ``unique-sam`` is implemented as
        
        1. copy a temp file from the original sam file
        2. extract the header of the sam file
        3. sort the alignments with Bash ``sort`` program
        
        -k Parameter
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``-k`` parameter give you the control on how to extract the alignment
        key from qname field the parameter of the ``-k`` is a regular
        expression. You should group the key part with parentheses. \*\* e.g.
        1\*\* > qname:
        ``N|GACGCGGATCTT/500407:4:H03E5AFXX:1:21109:5977:6969_2:N:0:ATACAA`` > >
        ``-k '(.*)\_[1-2](.*)'`` > > key will be:
        ``N|GACGCGGATCTT/500407:4:H03E5AFXX:1:21109:5977:6969:N:0:ATACAA`` >
        which will remove the ``_1/2`` part of the qname.
        
        \*\* e.g. 2\*\* > qname: ``HWI-ST667_0147:1:1101:1128:2079#CGATGT/1`` >
        > ``-k '(.*)\/[1-2]'`` > > key will be:
        ``HWI-ST667_0147:1:1101:1128:2079#CGATGT`` > which will remove the
        ``/1/2`` part of the qname.
        
        For more about **unique-sam** run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            unique-sam --help
        
        Unique Strategy
        ===============
        
        Following strategies are applied to find the unique & the best alignment
        
        1. Keep the alignment pair that has the highest score. If more than one
           pairs are found to have the same "Highest Score", these pairs will be
           removed.
        2. Read1 and Read2 should be mapped on different strands.
        3. The segment length decided by the read pairs should be longer than
           0.7 \* read length
        
        Log File
        ========
        
        All removed alignments will be written into log file ``input.sam.log``
        under current folder. Each line of the log file start with a symbol and
        followed by the deleted alignment (the original alignment record in the
        ``input.sam``). The symbol describe the reason of why this/these
        alignments should be removed. The specification of these symbols are
        listed in the follow table:
        
        \| Symbol \| Description \| \| ------ \| ----------- \| \| **!** \|
        Error lines \| \| **<** \| Low score alignments \| \| **=** \| Pairs
        with more than one best score \| \| **~** \| Read pair mapped on the
        same strand \| \| **?** \| Segment length too short \| \| **-** \|
        Invalid read1/2 information in flag filed or unmapped segment \|
