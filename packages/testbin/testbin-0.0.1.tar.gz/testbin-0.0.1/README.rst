Testbin
=======

Testbin is a library of Python modules and scripts built to help with software 
testing.

The primary guiding principles are:

* A testbin module must be useful to at least its author.
* Assume the purpose of a testbin module is to test another application, 
  service, API, etc.
* A testbin module may have broken-by-design functionality.
* Provide excellent documentation along with the module.

The name testbin is a play on the word 
`dustbin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_container>`_. Just like a trash 
can or a dustbin is a receptable, testbin 
contains things that are smelly but very much wanted. It doesn't hurt that a 
bin directory in UNIX-world contains executable binaries, just as tesbin has 
executable modules and scripts.

There are a lot of requirements for these modules and scripts which can 
result in a bloated environment to run them in. The purpose is not to run 
all these modules or scripts in the same environments. Instead, the idea is 
to take what you need, incorporate into your own code, and go from there.
