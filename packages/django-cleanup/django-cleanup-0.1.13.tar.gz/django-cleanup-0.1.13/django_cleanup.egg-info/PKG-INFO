Description: django-cleanup automatically deletes old file for FileField, ImageField and subclasses,
        and it also deletes files on models instance deletion.
        
        **Warning! If you use transactions you may lose you files if transaction will rollback.
        If you are concerned about it you need other solution for old file deletion in your project.**
        
        Most django projects I've seen don't use transactions and this app is designed for such projects.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - Support for Django 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7
        - Python 3 support
        
        
        How does it work?
        =================
        
        django-cleanup connects pre_save and post_delete signals to special functions(these functions
        delete old files) for each model which app is listed in INSTALLED_APPS above than 'django_cleanup'.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
            pip install django-cleanup
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Add django_cleanup to settings.py ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'django_cleanup', # should go after your apps
            )
        
        **django_cleanup** should be placed after all your apps. (At least after those apps which need to remove files.)
        
        
        Signals
        =======
        
        django-cleanup sends the following signals which can be imported from `django_cleanup.signals`:
        
        - **cleanup_pre_delete** just before a file is deleted. Passes a `file` keyword argument.
        - **cleanup_post_delete** just after a file is deleted. Passes a `file` keyword argument.
        
        Signals example for sorl.thumbnail
        ----------------------------------
        ::
        
            from django_cleanup.signals import cleanup_pre_delete, cleanup_post_delete
            
            def sorl_delete(**kwargs):
                from sorl.thumbnail import delete
                delete(kwargs['file'])
            
            cleanup_pre_delete.connect(sorl_delete)
