The `PackageDB-cli` was started in May of 2011 to allow user to consult the
package collection and to manage their Access Control List (ACL) using a simple
interface web free interface.

.. _`PackageDB-cli`: https://fedorahosted.org/packagedb-cli

As of 2014, this project has been ported to
`pkgdb2 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/pkgdb2>`_. At this occasion, it is
has been re-written to propose a python module to query pkgdb2 API as well
as the pkgdb2client.cli module containing the command line interface and the
pkgdb2client.admin module containing a command line interface for admins to
interact with `pkgdb2`_.
