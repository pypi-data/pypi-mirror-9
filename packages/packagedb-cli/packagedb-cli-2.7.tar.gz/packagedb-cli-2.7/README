The `PackageDB-cli` was started in May of 2011 to allow user to consult the
package collection and to manage their Access Control List (ACL) using a simple
interface web free interface.

As of 2014, this project has been ported to
`pkgdb2 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/pkgdb2>`_. At this occasion, it is
has been re-written to propose a python module to query pkgdb2 API as well
as a pkgdb2_cli module in case someone ever wants to re-use it.
