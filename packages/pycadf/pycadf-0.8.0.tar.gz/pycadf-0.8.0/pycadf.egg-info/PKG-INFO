Description: ======
        PyCADF
        ======
        
        This library provides an auditing data model based on the `Cloud Auditing Data
        Federation <http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cadf>`_ specification, primarily for
        use by OpenStack. The goal is to establish strict expectations about what
        auditors can expect from audit notifications.
