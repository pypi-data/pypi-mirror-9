Textbook Figures
----------------

This section makes available the source code used to generate every figure
in the book `Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy`.
Many of the figures are fairly self-explanatory, though some will be less
so without the book as a reference.  The table of contents of the book
can be seen :download:`here(pdf) <../documents/DMbookTOC.pdf>`.

Figure Contents
