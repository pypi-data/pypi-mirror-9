Description: This package contains the Python bindings for the Apache
        QPID Proton library.
        Before you can build or install these bindings, you must
        first install version 0.8 of the Proton development library
        (libqpid-proton) and its C header files. These files must be available in order
        to build this packages' C-based extension.
        
        Packages for the Proton development library may be provided by your system's
        distribution. For example, the qpid-proton-c-devel RPM is available for
        Centos/RHEL via EPEL.  A libqpid-proton2-dev deb file is available for Ubuntu
        via the Apache Qpid PPA (ppa:qpid/released).
        
        If your distribution does not make these packages available, you can download
        the Proton sources directly from the Apache Qpid project:
        
         http://qpid.apache.org
        
        This package is compatible with the 0.8 release of the Proton
        development library.
