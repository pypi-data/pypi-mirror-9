        This tool allows you writing documentation directly into YAML-files as
        comments. These comments will then be converted to text and the YAML-code
        goes into literal blocks.
        
        This is some kind of `literate programming`, except that you do not
        write code into your text, but text into your code. This difference
        allows to process the YAML file directly without any pre-processing.
        
        
        Usage::
        
          yaml2rst [-h] infile outfile
        
          positional arguments:
            infile      YAML-file to read (`-` for stdin)
            outfile     rst-file to write (`-` for stdout)
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help  show this help message and exit
        
        
        How it works
        ----------------
        
        This script takes all lines beginning with :literal:`#\ ` (and lines
        consisting of only a ``#``) as text-lines. Everything else will be
        treated as "code". The text-lines will get the :literal:`#\ ` removed
        and the "code" will get spaces prepended.
        
        Additionally at the start and at the end of a "code"-block, lines are
        added as required by reStructuredText. Also at the begin of a
        "code"-block, a ``::`` is added if required.
        
        
        Examples
        -------------
        
        You can find example yaml-input, rst-output and generated html in the
        examples directory. You may also view the generated html online at
        https://rawgit.com/htgoebel/yaml2rst/develop/examples/main.html.
