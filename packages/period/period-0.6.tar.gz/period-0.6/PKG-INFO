Description: period
        ======
        
        Period is a basic time period checking library.
        
        Period is based on period.py by William S. Annis. (available at
        https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~annis/creations/period.py.html)
        and ported to python3 with a few improvements. Period.py was in part inspired
        by perl's Time::Period module and the time class mechanism of Cfengine.
