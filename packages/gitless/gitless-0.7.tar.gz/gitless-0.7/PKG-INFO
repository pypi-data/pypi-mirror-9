Description: 
        Gitless is an experimental version control system built on top of Git.
        Many people complain that Git is hard to use. We think the problem lies
        deeper than the user interface, in the concepts underlying Git. Gitless
        is an experiment to see what happens if you put a simple veneer on an
        app that changes the underlying concepts. Because Gitless is implemented
        on top of Git (could be considered what Git pros call a "porcelain" of
        Git), you can always fall back on Git. And of course your coworkers you
        share a repo with need never know that you're not a Git aficionado.
