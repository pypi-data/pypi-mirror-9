TiddlyWeb
=========

TiddlyWeb is an open source `HTTP API`_  for storing and accessing
flexible and composable microcontent. It is also a toolkit for
`tiddlers`_ on the web and a robust server side for `TiddlyWiki`_.

.. _HTTP API: http://tiddlyweb.tiddlyspace.com/HTTP%20API
.. _tiddlers: http://tiddlyweb.tiddlyspace.com/tiddler
.. _TiddlyWiki: http://tiddlywiki.com/

TiddlyWeb by itself provides the base HTTP API, storage engine and
default serializations. A large variety of `plugins`_ provide
additional functionality.
