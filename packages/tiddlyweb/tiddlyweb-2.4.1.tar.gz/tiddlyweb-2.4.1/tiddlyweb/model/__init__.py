"""
Models for TiddlyWeb Entities.

Classes representing the important entities in the TiddlyWeb system.

These are intentionally limited, making no effort to handle their own
persistence or presentation. That is the job of the :py:class:`store
<tiddlyweb.store.Store>` and :py:class:`serializer
<tiddlyweb.serializer.Serializer>`.
