Description: This cube provides an authentication plugin which ensures proper
        authentication of users behind a trusted reverse proxy (eg. Apache +
        mod_ssl + mod_auth_kerb).
        
        The idea is that if the CubicWeb application is behind a reverse proxy
        that is responsible for authenticating users, the CubicWeb application
        do trust this latter when it says the user is authenticated as
        'user'. This information is simply passed from the reverse proxy to
        the CubicWeb application by an entry in the HTTP header.
        
        It is non-obstrusive and easy to plug.
        
        The typical usage is to implement a simple kerberos based
        authentication mecanism.
