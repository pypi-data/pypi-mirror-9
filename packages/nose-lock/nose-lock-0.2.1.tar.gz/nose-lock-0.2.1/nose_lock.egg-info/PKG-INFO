        This is a plugin for python-nose which locks test execution and doesn't
        allow to run them in parallel from two terminals.
        
        You could want this behaviour, when parallel tests will interfer for
        some reason. This could be because they go into one database or have
        other side effects which hard to isolate.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install via ``pip install nose-lock``, then run tests with argument
        ``--with-lock``.
        
        By default, lock is created as ``/tmp/<cur-dir-name>.lock`` file, but
        you could override this behaviour using optional parameter
        ``--lock-file``:
        
        ::
        
            nosetests --with-lock --lock-file /tmp/blah-minor
