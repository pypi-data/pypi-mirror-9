To install in a virtualenv, with the virtualenv enabled, run:

Developer Installation
======================
If you want to be able to edit the source code, but still have it referenced
from other Python modules, you can set the install to be a developer install.
In this case, download the source code, and extract it locally, or else clone
the git repository:
    git clone http://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/SpiNNMachine.git

To install as a development version which all users will then be able to use,
run the following where the code has been extracted:
    sudo python setup.py develop

To install as a development version for only yourself, run:
    python setup.py develop --user

To install as a development version in a virtualenv, with the virutalenv
enabled, run:
    python setup.py develop
