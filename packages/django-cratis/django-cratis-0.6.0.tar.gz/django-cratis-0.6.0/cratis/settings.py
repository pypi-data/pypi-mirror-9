class CratisConfig(Configuration):
    """
    Base class for Configurations that will be used with cratis.

    Class contains hooks pre_setup and post_setup that will load
    and configure Features defined in FEATURES settings variable.

    Also class defines ROOT_URLCONF settings variable, that use cratis.urls
    to load all urls collected from your Features. Usually you wouldn't change this
    when working with cratis.

    BASE_DIR just points to project directory, so you can specify paths relatively, ex:

    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(CratisConfig.BASE_DIR, 'some dir')

    Order of Feature load is following:

     - Call set_settings() on each Feature, providing class reference, so Feature can save it for future use.
     - Call do_load() on each Feature, passing previously loaded feature list as an argument
     - .. now django-configurations executes own internal things..
     - Django is fully configured, we run on_after_load on each Feature, so Features can do latest adjustments
     - And finally call on_startup() on each feature, features shouldn't modify anything on this step.
