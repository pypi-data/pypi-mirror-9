        LinOTP 2 is also open as far as its modular architecture is concerned. \n\
        LinOTP 2 aims to not bind you to any  decision of the authentication protocol or \n\
        it does not dictate you where your user information should be stored. \n\
        This is achieved by its new, totally modular architecture.\n\
\n\
        This package contains a PAM module for LinOTP written in python.'
