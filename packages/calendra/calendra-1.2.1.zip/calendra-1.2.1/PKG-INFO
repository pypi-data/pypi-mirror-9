        Calendra
        ========
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        Calendra is a Python module that offers classes able to handle calendars,
        list legal / religious holidays and gives working-day-related computation
        functions.
        
        History
        =======
        
        Calendra is a fork of `Workalendar <https://github.com/novapost/workalendar>`_
        designed to be more extensible and introspectable, adding interfaces where
        `Workalendar is philosophically opposed for the sake of simplicity
        <https://github.com/novapost/workalendar/pull/79>`_.
        
        Status
        ======
        
        The project is stable and in production use. Calendra follows the principles
        of `semver <https://semver.org>`_ for released verisons.
        
        Usage sample
        ============
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from datetime import date
            >>> from calendra.europe import France
            >>> cal = France()
            >>> cal.holidays(2012)
            [(datetime.date(2012, 1, 1), 'New year'),
             (datetime.date(2012, 4, 9), 'Easter Monday'),
             (datetime.date(2012, 5, 1), 'Labour Day'),
             (datetime.date(2012, 5, 8), 'Victory in Europe Day'),
             (datetime.date(2012, 5, 17), 'Ascension Day'),
             (datetime.date(2012, 5, 28), 'Whit Monday'),
             (datetime.date(2012, 7, 14), 'Bastille Day'),
             (datetime.date(2012, 8, 15), 'Assumption of Mary to Heaven'),
             (datetime.date(2012, 11, 1), "All Saints' Day"),
             (datetime.date(2012, 11, 11), 'Armistice Day'),
             (datetime.date(2012, 12, 25), 'Christmas')]
            >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 25))  # it's Christmas
            False
            >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 30))  # it's Sunday
            False
            >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 26))
            True

        Caveats
        =======
        
        Please take note that some calendars are not 100% accurate. The most common
        example is the Islamic calendar, where some computed holidays are not exactly on
        the same official day decided by religious authorities, and this may vary
        country by country. Whenever it's possible, try to adjust your results with
        the official data provided by the adequate authorities.
