    MessageDispatcher is a PubSub state machine that routes data packets

    dict structure where the keys are unique addresses and the values are
    instances of RecipientManager. "address"es (i.e. RecipientManagers) are
    created and/or subscribed to. Subscribing to an address results in
    registering a clientswebsocket (i.e. the transport associated to the
    SockJSResource protocol) within a dict that is internal to the Manager
    called "transports".
    RecipientManager's purpose is to expose functions that MessageDispatcher
    can leverage to execute the PubSub process.
    N.B. subscribing a client to an address opens that client to all data
        published to that address. As such it useful to think of addresses as
        channels. To acheive a private channel an obsure address is required.
