Description: Sailabove client
        
        Sailabove.com is a docker hosting solution aiming to be as flexible as a
        container and as elegant as a sailboat.
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            # get the CLI
            pip install sail
        
            # activate autocompletion support
            activate-global-python-argcomplete
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        ``sail`` automatically loads registry's credentials from ``docker`` keyring.
        Hence, after a succesfull push to Sailabove's registry, there should be no
        need for configuration.
        
        If you wish to temporarily override a parameter, you may use ``SAIL_HOST``,
        ``SAIL_USER`` and ``SAIL_PASSWORD`` to respectively force the API endpoint,
        the username and the password. Additionally, these parameters may be set via
        ``--api-host``, ``--api-user`` and ``--api-password``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Once you have claimed your private namespace on http://labs.runabove.com/docker and
        sucessfuly pushed your first image you may launch and supervice a service
        from this template image. For example, taking a ``my-redis`` Docker, let's
        create a ``redis`` service:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sail services add my-redis redis
        
        Watch your private cluster's status:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sail services ps
        
        Scale your cluster:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sail services scale redis --number 2
        
        Clear everything:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sail services rm redis
