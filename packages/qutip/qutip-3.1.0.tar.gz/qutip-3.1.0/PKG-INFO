Description: QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of closed and open
        quantum systems. The QuTiP library depends on the excellent Numpy, Scipy, and
        Cython numerical packages. In addition, graphical output is provided by
        Matplotlib.  QuTiP aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical
        simulations of a wide variety of quantum mechanical problems, including those
        with Hamiltonians and/or collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence,
        commonly found in a wide range of physics applications. QuTiP is freely
        available for use and/or modification on all common platforms. Being free of
        any licensing fees, QuTiP is ideal for exploring quantum mechanics in research
        as well as in the classroom.
