      Sake is a way to easily design, share, build, and visualize workflows
      with intricate interdependencies. Sake is self-documenting because the
      instructions for building a project also serve as the documentation of
      the project's workflow. The first time it's run, sake will build all
      of the components of a project in an order that automatically satisfies
      all dependencies. For all subsequent runs, sake will only rebuild the
      parts of the project that depend on changed files. This cuts down on
      unnecessary re-building and lets the user concentrate on their work
      rather than memorizing the order in which commands have to be run.
