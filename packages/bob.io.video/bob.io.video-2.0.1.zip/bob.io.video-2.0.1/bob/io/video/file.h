/**
 * This defines the factory method F that can create codecs of this type.
 *
 * Here are the meanings of the mode flag that should be respected by your
 * factory implementation:
 *
 * 'r': opens for reading only - no modifications can occur; it is an
 *      error to open a file that does not exist for read-only operations.
 * 'w': opens for reading and writing, but truncates the file if it
 *      exists; it is not an error to open files that do not exist with
 *      this flag.
 * 'a': opens for reading and writing - any type of modification can
 *      occur. If the file does not exist, this flag is effectively like
 *      'w'.
 *
 * Returns a newly allocated File object that can read and write data to the
 * file using a specific backend.
 *
 * @note: This method can be static.
