        PyLinkbot - A Python package for controlling Barobo Linkbots
        Contact: David Ko <david@barobo.com>
        
        Linkbots are small modular robots designed to play an interactive role in
        computer science and mathematics curricula. More information may be found at
        http://www.linkbotlabs.com .
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        This package is built against Python 3.4 . Python 2 is explicitely not
        supported, and other versions of Python 3 may or may not work. Additionally,
        the SciPy <http://www.scipy.org> is highly recommended for graphical plotting
        and more.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The recommended way to install this package is through setuptools utilities,
        such as "easy_install" or "pip". For example:
        
            easy_install3 PyLinkbot
        
        or
        
            pip3 install PyLinkbot
