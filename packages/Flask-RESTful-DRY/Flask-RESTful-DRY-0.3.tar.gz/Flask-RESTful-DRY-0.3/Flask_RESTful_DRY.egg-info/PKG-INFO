Description: =================
        Flask-RESTful-DRY
        =================
        
        
        Allows the declaration of RESTful APIs using simple declarations so that you
        don't need to write executable code for every HTTP method on every API.
        Introduces:
        
        * Inheritable declarations at the class level, including the ability to
          modify the base class declarations.
        * Dynamic creation of Flask-RESTful_ API Resource classes, so that you
          can automatically generate the same pattern of URLs many times.
        * Reducing HTTP method code to a series of re-usable steps.  These are
          automatically ordered for each HTTP method to meet ordering
          constraints specified on each step.  This allows the requirements for
          the HTTP method code to be reduced to a simple declaration of what
          steps to include.  Because these steps are automatically ordered,
          they may be specified in any order, making it easy to add or remove
          steps from inherited standard recipes.
        * Adds column validation and introspection to Flask-SQLAlchemy_ tables,
          and automatically generates metadata descriptions of what colums are
          allowed to be POSTed or PUT, including the server validation rules
          that will be applied to each column.  This lets you specify the
          validation rules in one place for both server and client.
        * Provides column-level authorization for all HTTP methods.
        * Supports nested child rows (relationships) in APIs (and nested
          column-level authorization).
