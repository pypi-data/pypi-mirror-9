CHANGES
=======

0.2.2 (2015-01-07)
------------------
- RFC compliance fixes (patch contributed by jaimeperez)

Important: This change introduces a temporarily injected key (__v) in order to
distinguish between legacy and newly issued tokens. This allows for the use
of either token as to not break backwards compatibility and (possibly)
degrade user experience. This will be removed for v1.0.

In order to verify whether or not clients are using a legacy token, the
application code can verify whether or not the key "__v" is contained in the
headers (this can be done after deserialize_compact). The existence of the key
identifies a newly created token.

- Added custom exceptions, making client error handling easier

0.1 (2014-04-16)
