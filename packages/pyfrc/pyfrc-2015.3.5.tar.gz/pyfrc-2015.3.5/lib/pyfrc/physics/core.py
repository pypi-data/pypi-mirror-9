'''
    pyfrc supports simplistic custom physics model implementations for
    simulation and testing support. It can be as simple or complex as you want
    to make it. We will continue to add helper functions (such as the 
    :mod:`pyfrc.physics.drivetrains` module) to make this a lot easier
    to do. General purpose physics implementations are welcome also!

    The idea is you provide a :class:`PhysicsEngine` object that overrides specific
    pieces of WPILib, and modifies motors/sensors accordingly depending on the
    state of the simulation. An example of this would be measuring a motor
    moving for a set period of time, and then changing a limit switch to turn 
    on after that period of time. This can help you do more complex simulations
    of your robot code without too much extra effort.

    .. note::

       One limitation to be aware of is that the physics implementation
       currently assumes that you are only calling :func:`wpilib.Timer.delay`
       once per main loop iteration. If you do it more than that, you may get
       some rather funky results.

    By default, pyfrc doesn't modify any of your inputs/outputs without being
    told to do so by your code or the simulation GUI.
    
    See the physics sample for more details.

    Enabling physics support
    ------------------------

    You must create a python module called ``physics.py`` next to your 
    ``robot.py``. A physics module must have a class called
    :class:`PhysicsEngine` which must have a function called ``update_sim``.
    When initialized, it will be passed an instance of this object.
    
    You must also create a 'sim' directory, and place a ``config.json``
    file there, with the following JSON information::
    
        {
          "pyfrc": {
            "robot": {
              "w": 2,
              "h": 3,
              "starting_x": 2,
              "starting_y": 20,
              "starting_angle": 0
            },
            "field": {
              "w": 25,
              "h": 27,
              "px_per_ft": 10
            }
          }
        }
