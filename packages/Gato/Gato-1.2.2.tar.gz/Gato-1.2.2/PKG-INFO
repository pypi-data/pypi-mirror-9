Description: 
        Gato, the Graph Animation Toolbox http://gato.sf.net by Alexander
        Schliep and Winfried Hochstaettler, is a LGPL-licensed Python
        application which animates algorithms on graphs. It uses Tkinter and
        runs on Unix, MacOS X, Linux and Windows.
        
        It is primarily a teaching tool, but can also be useful in research on
        algorithm design and engineering, for example by demonstrating effects of
        heuristics.
        
        It is used in CATBox (Springer 2010, see authors' website
        http://schliep.org/CATBox) by Winfried Hochstaettler and Alexander
        Schliep. CATBox is a textbook on combinatorial optimization on graphs
        (traversals, minimal spanning trees, shortest paths, maximum flows,
        min-cost flows, cardinality and weighted matching) which uses Gato to
        provide interactive animations and exercises for all algorithms.  A

        Gato and CATBox has been used in university classrooms for several
        years by us and colleagues on several continents at the undergraduate
        and graduate level.  Winfried Hochstaettler is a professor in
        mathematics at the FernUniversitaet Hagen, Germany and Alexander
        Schliep is an associate professor in computer science and quantitative
        biology at Rutgers University.
