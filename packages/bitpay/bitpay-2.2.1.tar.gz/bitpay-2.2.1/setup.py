Python Library for integrating with BitPay
-------------------------------------

This library is a simple way to integrate your application with
BitPay for taking bitcoin payments. It exposes three basic 
functions, authenticating with bitpay, creating invoices, 
and retrieving invoices. It is not meant as a replacement for 
the entire BitPay API. However, the key_utils module contains
all of the tools you need to use the BitPay API for other
purposes.

This version requires Python 3 or later; a Python 2 version is available separately.
