**SmartAnthill** is an open IoT system which allows easy control over multiple
microcontroller-powered devices, creating a home- or office-wide heterogeneous
network out of these devices.

SmartAnthill system can be pretty much anything: from a system to control
railway network model to an office-wide heating control and security system.
As an open system, SmartAnthill can integrate together a wide range of devices
beginning from embedded development boards and ending with off-the-shelf
sensors and actuators. They can be connected via very different communication
means - from wired (currently Serial, with CAN bus and Ethernet planned soon)
to wireless (currently IEEE 802.15.4, with low-cost RF, Bluetooth Smart,
ZigBee and WiFi planned soon).

All SmartAnthill devices within a system are controlled from the one place
(such as PC or credit-card sized computer Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard or
CubieBoard), with an optional access via Internet.
