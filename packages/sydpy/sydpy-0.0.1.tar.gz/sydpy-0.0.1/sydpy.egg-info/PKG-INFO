Description: ================
        Welcome to SyDPy
        ================
        
        SyDPy (**System Design in Python**) aims to become an alternative to SystemVerilog and 
        `SystemC <http://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc>`_ by providing the necessary tools to cover tasks of 
        HDL design from system architecture design to HDL synthesis.
        
        SyDPy comprises an event based simulator and various classes for describing and simulating a system, all written in Python. 
        This allows an easy extension of the SyDPy with additional user classes or existing Python libraries
        
        SyDPy was written with design reuse and iterable nature of the design process in mind. Smart channels enable cosimulation of 
        module architectures written on various abstraction levels (of timing and functionality), without the need of explicit 
        interface converters in the design. Modules with higher levels of abstraction can then serve as model checkers for lower
        level modules. 
        
        SyDPy features:
        ===============
         - RTL and TLM cosimulation
         - Smart channels for information exchange between various interfaces
         - Global simulator configuration for test setup
         - Basic randomization, sequencing and scoreboarding supported
         - Automatic model checking between different module architectures
         - Extendible simulator kernel
         
        Soon available:
        ===============
         - Verilog cosimulation using `Verilator <http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator>`_
         - Python to Verilog conversion
         - Constrained-random verification using `SystemC Verification <http://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc>`_ library
