extypes
=======

This project provides a few enhanced types for Python:

* A "constrained set" (ordered or not)
* That's all for now.


It also provides extensions for Django.


It has been fully tested with all versions of Python from 2.6 to 3.4; and is distributed under the BSD license.

Getting started
---------------

Intall the package from PyPI, using pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install extypes

Or from GitHub:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone git://github.com/rbarrois/extypes
    $ cd extypes
    $ python setup.py install


To check that everything went fine, fire a Python shell and import ``extypes``:


.. code-block:: python

    import extypes


Introduction
------------

.. currentmodule:: extypes

``extypes`` provides a new type, ``ConstrainedSet``.

This is a ``set()``-like object, but values can only be taken from a
specific set of options.


A ``ConstrainedSet`` is declared in a manner very similar to ``collections.namedtuple``:

.. code-block:: python

    import extypes
    Foods = extypes.ConstrainedSet(['eggs', 'spam', 'bacon'])

This will declare a new class, ``Foods``, whose instances are ``ConstrainedSet`` that only accept
options among ``'eggs'``, ``'spam'`` and ``'bacon'``.


Those objects can be used as simple ``set()`` objects:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import extypes
    >>> Foods = extypes.ConstrainedSet(['eggs', 'spam', 'bacon'])
    >>> meat = Foods(['spam', 'bacon'])
    >>> fresh = Foods(['bacon', 'eggs'])
    >>> 'eggs' in meat
    False
    >>> 'eggs' in fresh
    True
    >>> meat & fresh
    Foods(['bacon'])

As a ``set()`` object, they are mutable:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import extypes
    >>> Foods = extypes.ConstrainedSet(['eggs', 'spam', 'bacon'])
    >>> meat = Foods(['spam', 'bacon'])
    >>> meat.remove('spam')
    >>> meat
    Foods(['bacon'])

And iterable:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import extypes
    >>> Foods = extypes.ConstrainedSet(['eggs', 'spam', 'bacon'])
    >>> meat = Foods(['bacon', 'spam'])
    >>> list(meat)
    ['spam', 'bacon']

But only valid options are accepted:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> Foods = extypes.ConstrainedSet(['eggs', 'spam', 'bacon'])
    >>> greens = Foods(['spinach']
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Invalid keys ['spinach'], please use a value in ['spam', 'bacon', 'eggs'].


Extensions: Django
------------------

.. currentmodule:: extypes.django

``extypes`` also provides custom fields for Django - compatible with Django 1.6 and upwards.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    import extypes
    import extypes.django

    Foods = extypes.ConstrainedSet(['eggs', 'spam', 'bacon'])

    class Fridge(models.Model):
        contents = extypes.django.SetField(choices=Foods)

This field will simply behave as a simple ``ConstrainedSet``.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> fridge = Fridge(contents=['bacon'])
    >>> fridge.contents.add('eggs')
    >>> fridge.save()


It is displayed in forms as a multiple choice field.
In the database, it is saved as a ``|``-separated list of enabled values
(in the above example, the field is stored as ``|eggs|bacon|``).

.. note:: ``extypes.django.SetField`` can also receive a choice-like list:

          .. code-block:: python

              class Fridge(models.Model):
                  contents = extypes.django.SetField(choices=[('eggs', "Eggs"), ('spam', "Spam"), ('bacon', "Yummy bacon")])
