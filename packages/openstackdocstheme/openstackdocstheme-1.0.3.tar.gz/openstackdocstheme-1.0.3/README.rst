OpenStack docs.openstack.org Sphinx Theme
=========================================

Theme and extension support for Sphinx documentation that is published to
docs.openstack.org. Intended for use by OpenStack projects.

Using the Theme
===============

Prior to using this theme, ensure your project can use the OpenStack
brand by referring to the brand guidelines at
http://www.openstack.org/brand.

Update the requirements list for your project to
include ``openstackdocstheme`` (usually in test-requirements.txt).

If your project previously used the oslosphinx theme (without modifying
the header navigation), remove oslosphinx from your requirements list,
and then in your ``conf.py`` you can remove the import statement and
extension listing for oslosphinx.

Then modify your Sphinx settings in ``conf.py`` to include::

   import openstackdocstheme

   html_theme = 'openstackdocs'
   html_theme_path = [openstackdocstheme.get_html_theme_path()]

Those settings are included in the file generated by Sphinx when you
initialize a project, so they may already have values that need to be
changed.
