Demo documentation
==================

The demo documentation provides example markup for looking at the expected output.

The project aims for simple implementation, massive scalability, and a rich set
of features. Cloud computing experts from around the world contribute to the project.

Here's an example configuration::

   [DEFAULT]
   ...
   my_ip = 10.0.0.31
   vnc_enabled = True
   vncserver_listen = 0.0.0.0
   vncserver_proxyclient_address = 10.0.0.31
   novncproxy_base_url = http://controller:6080/vnc_auto.html


Here's another example that's python code:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def builder_inited(app):
        theme_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'theme')
        app.info('Using openstack theme from %s' % theme_dir)
        # Insert our theme directory at the front of the search path and
        # force the theme setting to use the one in the package. This is
        # done here, instead of in setup(), because conf.py is read after
        # setup() runs, so if the conf contains these values the user
        # values overwrite these. That's not bad for the theme, but it
        # breaks the search path.
        app.config.html_theme_path.insert(0, theme_dir)
        # Set the theme name
        app.config.html_theme = 'openstack'
        # Re-initialize the builder, if it has the method for setting up
        # the templates and theme.
        if hasattr(app.builder, 'init_templates'):
            app.builder.init_templates()

Here's the same example but with ..code-block: ini to test the pygments lexer:

.. code-block:: ini

  [DEFAULT]
  ...
  my_ip = 10.0.0.31
  vnc_enabled = True
  vncserver_listen = 0.0.0.0
  vncserver_proxyclient_address = 10.0.0.31
  novncproxy_base_url = http://controller:6080/vnc_auto.html
