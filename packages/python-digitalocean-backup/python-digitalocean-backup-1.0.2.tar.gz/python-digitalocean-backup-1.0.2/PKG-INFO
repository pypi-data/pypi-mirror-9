        ###### Works with posix (*nix, osx, cygwin)
            Tested with Python 2.7.8(CYGWIN), 2.7.9(OS X/Linux), 3.4.3(OS X/Linux)

        rsync_excludes = ['cache', '.DS_Store', 'man3', 'terminfo']
        remote_dirs = ['/home', '/var/log', '/var/www']
        
        manager = digitalocean.Manager(token=token)
        for droplet in manager.get_all_droplets():
            backup(
                droplet=droplet,  # pass in a droplet obj
                ssh_user='droplet_ssh_user',  # ssh user
                ssh_key='droplet_ssh_key',  # ssh key file name or full path
                remote_dirs=remote_dirs,  # remote directories to rsync
                rsync_excludes=rsync_excludes,  # rsync excludes
                snapshot_hour=3,  # hour of day to take snapshot
