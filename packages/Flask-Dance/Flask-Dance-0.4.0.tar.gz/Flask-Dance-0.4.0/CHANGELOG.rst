Nothing yet

0.4.0 (2015-02-12)
------------------
* Renamed ``assign_token_to_session`` to ``load_token``
* Added a ``from_config`` dict to OAuthConsumerBlueprint objects. The info
  in that dict is used to dynamically populate information on the blueprint
  at runtime from the configuration of the app that the blueprint is bound to.
  Also set up sensible configuration variable names for the pre-set
  configurations.
* If neither ``redirect_url`` nor ``redirect_to`` are specified, default to
  redirecting the user to the root of the website (``/``). Previously,
  specifying one of these two options was required.

0.3.2 (2015-01-06)
------------------
* Added a the Google pre-set configuration.

0.3.1 (2014-12-16)
------------------

  requests.Session subclass with custom behavior.

0.3.0 (2014-12-15)
------------------
* Changed ``OAuthConsumerMixin.created_on`` to ``OAuthConsumerMixin.created_at``,

  from an older version of Flask-Dance and using ``OAuthConsumerMixin``,
  this will require a database migration.
