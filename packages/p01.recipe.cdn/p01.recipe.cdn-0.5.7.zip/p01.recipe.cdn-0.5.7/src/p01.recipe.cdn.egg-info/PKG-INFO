Description: The ``p01.recipe.cdn:app`` recipe generates a script which is able to extract
        content delivery resources defined by the p01.cdn meta directives from a
        project to a given folder. Additional there is a minify recipe which generates
        a minify script which is able to collect resources from a local project or
        released python packages, minify and bundle them. And there is a glue recipe
        which is able to generate sprite images. In short words, three is everything
        you will need to generate and extract resources for a content delivery network.

        This buildout recipe package offers 3 different concepts. This 3 concept allows
        you to reduce the resources size and offload the resources from your
        application server. The nice thing is, that you can start your application with
        different configurations if you like to server the minified and static or the
        local non monified resource versions. The p01.cdn package also offers a version
        manager which allows to use different resource versions.
        
        
        sprites
        -------
        
        The first concept allows to generate sprite images and the relevant css styles
        pointing to the right sprite background position. This recipe uses the
        spritemapper python package
        
        
        minify
        ------
        
        The second concept allows to minify javascript or CSS files. The recipe supports
        the following python minify libraries.
        
          jsmin: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsmin
          lpjsmin: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lpjsmin
          slimit: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/slimit
          cssmin: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cssmin
        
        
        content delivery network
        ------------------------
        
        The third concept allows to extract CDN (content delivery network) resources
        based on p01.cdn into a folder structure.
