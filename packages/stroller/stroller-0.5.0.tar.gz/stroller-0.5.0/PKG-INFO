Description: About Stroller
        -------------------------
        
        Stroller is a Pluggable eCommerce application and library for TurboGears2.
        Stroller can be plugged as a pluggable application using tgext.pluggable
        or manually mounted and used as a library to implement paypal payment
        or ecommerce parts.
        
        Installing
        -------------------------------
        
        stroller can be installed both from pypi or from bitbucket::
        
            easy_install stroller
        
        should just work for most of the users
        
        Plugging Stroller
        ----------------------------
        
        In your application *config/app_cfg.py* import **plug**::
        
            from tgext.pluggable import plug
        
        Then at the *end of the file* call plug with stroller::
        
            plug(base_config, 'stroller')
        
        You will be able to access the ecommerce at
        *http://localhost:8080/shop*.
        
        Manual/Paypal Payments
        -----------------------------
        
        Strollers works both automatically managing payments using paypal or by
        manually managing orders.
        
        When **avoid_manage_payment** options is enabled stroller will register
        the order and ask the user to contact the site manager to proceed
        with the payment instead of using paypal to handle it.
        
        Anonyoums/Registered Orders
        -----------------------------
        
        Stroller is able to handle payments both in registered or anonymous way.
        When users are logged their user data is registered inside the order
        metadata to make possible to contact them later. If manual payments
        are enabled instead of paypal based ones an email will be sent
        to both the user and the site manager to let them proceed with
        the payment.
        
        When paypal is enabled and the user is not logged his paypal
        data will be used to register the order. This is the suggested
        way to use stroller as you won't ask your users to register but
        you will have all their data available to dispatch the orders.
        
        **NOTE:** If manual payments are required and user is not registered
        a plain alert asking him to contact the site manager will be visible
        at the end of the order confirmation. It is usually suggested not to
        let stroller run this way as you will find many orders with any
        information about who did them.
