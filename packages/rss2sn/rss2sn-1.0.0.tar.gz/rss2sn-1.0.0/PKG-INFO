Description: # rss2sn
        
        Quick and dirty RSS to StatusNet client.
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can use it straight from a Git clone, and run it like:
        
            $ cp rss2sn.cfg.sample ~/.rss2sn.cfg
            $ $EDITOR ~/.rss2sn.cfg
            $ ./rss2sn.py -a AccountName
        
        You may want to add it to your `crontab`.
        
        If you prefer, you can use `pip` to install rss2sn and run
        it from your site-packages like:
        
           $ python /usr/lib/python/site-packages/rss2sn.py -a AccountName
        
        By using `pip install rss2sn` you make sure that you get
        the dependencies installed along with rss2sn.
        
        ## How it works
        
        It fetches the RSS feed and checks each item's pubDate against
        the local stored value of the last pushed item. If no local
        value is found, local time is stored, and nothing is posted.
        
        This behavior can be changed by setting bootstrap = True in the
        feed's configuration. When bootstrap is set, on missing last
        item's date, a one year back date is saved and used as bootstrap
        "since" date. This way the first run will (most probably) post
        some notices.
