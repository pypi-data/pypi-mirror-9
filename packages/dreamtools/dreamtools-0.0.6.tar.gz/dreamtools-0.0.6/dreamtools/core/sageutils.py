"""A module dedicated to synapse

The class :class:`SynapseClient` is a specialised class built upon synapseclient
package, which source code is on GIT::
 
    git clone git://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapsePythonClient.git
    cd synapsePythonClient
    python setup.py install

When I started to build dream8 synapse pages and leaderboards, the synapseclient
was still in development. In order to test the system, I built this class
(SynapseClient) to add high level functionalities. These functionalities have
been included later in the synapseclient. After successive cleanups, I've still
have a couple of methods that may be redundant with synapse or not...
