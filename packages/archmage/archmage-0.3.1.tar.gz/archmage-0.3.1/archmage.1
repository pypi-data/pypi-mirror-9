.SH NAME
archmage \- CHM(Compiled HTML) Decompressor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B archmage
.I chmfile directory
.br
.B archmage
\-p port 
.I chmfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B archmage
command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBarCHMage\fP is an extensible reader and decompiler for files in the
CHM format. This is the format used by Microsoft HTML Help, and is
also known as Compiled HTML. arCHMage is based on python-chm binding to 
chmlib from GnoCHM project.
.SH USAGE
.PP
There is three ways to use arCHMage package now: 
.PP
1) Extract .chm to directory (directory will be created):

	archmage <chmfile> <directory>
.PP
2) Run as http-server, which will publish chm file contents on
specified port:

	archmage \-p <port> <chmfile>
.PP
3) Tune your apache to publish chm file contents if there is trailing
slash in request to that file (you will need working mod_python for
that):

	Add that lines to your httpd.conf:

	   AddHandler python-program .chm 
.br
	   PythonHandler archmod.mod_chm

	Restart apache.
.PP
Let's suppose, you have file sample.chm in DocumentRoot of your
apache. After that tuning you can receive raw chm file, if you point
your browser to

	http://yourserver/sample.chm
.PP
or you can view chm file on the fly if you point your browser to

	http://yourserver/sample.chm/ (note trailing slash)
