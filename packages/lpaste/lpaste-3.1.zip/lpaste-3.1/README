lpaste
======

``lpaste`` is a command-line client for librarypaste. The client can
paste code or attachments.

Install with "easy_install lpaste" or "pip install lpaste".


OS X App
========

This project also hosts, though no longer maintains, lpaste.app, an OS X
Automator action to run lpaste -ab. Install lpaste and copy the app
somewhere easy to use and drag and drop files onto it.
