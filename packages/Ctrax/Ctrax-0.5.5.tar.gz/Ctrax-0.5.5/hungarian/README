hungarian

This is a modified version of Harold Cooper's Python wrapper for a C++ implementation of the Hungarian algorithm. It has been modified to work with the Numarray that is part of Numpy, rather than the old Numarray package by Kristin Branson. Below is the README for the original wrapper.

***

This module is just a simple wrapper for a C++ implementation of Knuth's Hungarian algorithm, a.k.a. Munkres' algorithm, for the linear assignment problem.

Note that this module depends on the numarray module. You must install numarray before you can compile this module. Numarray can be downloaded from http://numpy.sf.net

If you have any problems with this module, you should email me (hbc@mit.edu), not Mr. Battre.


To build this module run:
> python setup.py build
Then you can either put the file build/lib-<YOUR-PLATFORM>/hungarian.so in the same directory as the code that will be using it, or you can install it so that all of your python programs can see it:
> python setup.py install

For the module's documentation, type at a Python prompt:
>>> help('hungarian')


Additional Information:

This wrapper for the algorithm uses double precision (i.e. 64-bit) floating point arithmetic. To change it to single precision, integer, or anything else, simply change the corresponding types in asp.h
