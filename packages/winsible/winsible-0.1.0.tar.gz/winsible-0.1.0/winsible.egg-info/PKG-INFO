Description: winsible - a faster Ansible (especially on Cygwin)
        ==================================================
        
        winsible is an experimental wrapper for `ansible-playbook` that enhances its multiprocessing and connection persistence, for platforms where OpenSSH can't transparently do its own connection pooling (such as EL5 and Cygwin).
        
        And unlike Ansible's own `accelerate` or `fireball` modes, it doesn't require installing anything on the target computers: you just install it on the machine where you run your playbooks, and use `winsible-playbook` instead of `ansible-playbook`.  
        
        
        Installation and Use
        --------------------
        
        Install winsible with `pip install winsible` or `easy_install winsible`.  If you don't have these commands on your system, try installing your platform's `python-setuptools` package.  (Also, if you're not on Cygwin, you'll need to be root or use sudo, or install them to a virtualenv.)
        
        If you have a current version of `gevent` on your system (1.0.1 or better), winsible can use it to eliminate forking altogether and run plays against all hosts with a single process.  But this is a relatively small performance boost compared to connection pooling (and is somewhat experimental), so it's optional and has to be explicitly activated.  If you want to try it, you can install gevent with `sudo pip install "gevent>=1.0.1"` or `sudo easy_install "gevent>=1.0.1"`.  (Then enable it with `ANSIBLE_PROCESS_MODE=gevent` in the environment or `process_mode=gevent` in your ansible.cfg's `[defaults]` section.) 
        
        Last, but not least, make sure you've got an `ssh` command: if you're on Cygwin, install the `openssh` package, or on Linux distros it might be in an `openssh-clients` package.
        
        Once you have these things installed, you're ready to use `winsible-playbook` in place of `ansible-playbook`, to enjoy faster playbook runs.   (A `winsible` script is also included, for completeness, but it doesn't provide much in the way of acceleration.  It does, however, tweak ansible's defaults so that the `ssh` transport will work correctly on Cygwin.)
        
        Note: At the moment, this project as a whole is still pretty alpha.  (Especially the `gevent` mode.)  In general, winsible has *not* been run on a very wide variety of hosts, modules, or plugins, so experience reports are welcome.  If something breaks, or if it doesn't improve performance in your use case, please file an issue on the github page with some details so I can have a look at it.  Thanks!
