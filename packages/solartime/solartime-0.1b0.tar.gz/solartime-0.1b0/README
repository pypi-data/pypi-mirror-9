This is 'solartime', a Python module which calculates times for various positions of the sun:
dawn, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, and dusk.

'solartime' is a vastly-simplified fork of Simon Kennedy's 'astral' module, and is Free / Libre
Open Source software under the Apache 2.0 license.

Its only dependency is the `pytz` package, and Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3+.


Example usage:

    >>> from datetime import date
    >>> from pytz import timezone
    >>> from solartime import SolarTime
    >>>
    >>> today = date(2014, 4, 20)
    >>> localtz = timezone('US/Eastern')
    >>> lat, lon = 38.0, -79.0
    >>>
    >>> sun = SolarTime()
    >>> schedule = sun.sun_utc(today, lat, lon)
    >>> sunset = schedule['sunset'].astimezone(localtz)
    >>> print sunset
