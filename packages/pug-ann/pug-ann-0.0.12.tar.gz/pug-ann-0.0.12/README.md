## Installation

### On a Posix System

You really want to contribute, right?

    git clone https://github.com/hobson/pug-ann.git

If your a user and not a developer, and have an up-to-date posix OS with the postgres, xml2, and xlst development packages installed, then just use `pip`.

    pip install pug-ann

### Fedora

If you're on Fedora >= 16 but haven't done a lot of python binding development, then you'll need some libraries before pip will succeed.

    sudo yum install -y python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel gcc-gfortran python-scikit-learn postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-libs postgresql-devel
    pip install pug

### Bleeding Edge

Even the releases are very unstable, but if you want to have the latest, most broken code

    pip install git+git://github.com/hobsonlane/pug.git@master

### Warning

This software is in alpha testing.  Install at your own risk.
