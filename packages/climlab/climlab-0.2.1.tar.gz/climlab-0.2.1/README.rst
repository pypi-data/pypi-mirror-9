About climlab
--------------
``climlab`` is a flexible engine for process-oriented climate modeling.
It is based on a very general concept of a model as a collection of individual, 
interacting processes. ``climlab`` defines a base class called ``Process``, which
can contain an arbitrarily complex tree of sub-processes (each also some 
sub-class of ``Process``). Every climate process (radiative, dynamical, 
physical, turbulent, convective, chemical, etc.) can be simulated as a stand-alone
process model given appropriate input, or as a sub-process of a more complex model. 
New classes of model can easily be defined and run interactively by putting together an
appropriate collection of sub-processes.

Most of the actual computation uses vectorized ``numpy`` array functions. 
It should run out-of-the-box on a standard scientific Python distribution.
Future versions of ``climlab`` will provide hooks to compiled Fortran code for 
more numerically intensive processes.

Currently, ``climlab`` has out-of-the-box support and documented examples for 

- 1D grey-radiation and radiative-convective single column models
- 1D diffusive energy balance models
- Seasonal and steady-state models
- orbital / insolation calculations.

Example usage
------------------
The directory ``climlab/courseware/`` contains a collection of IPython notebooks (*.ipynb)
used for teaching some basics of climate science, 
and documenting use of the ``climlab`` package.
These are self-describing, and should all run out-of-the-box once the package is installed, e.g:

``ipython notebook Insolation.ipynb``

History
----------------------
The first versions of the code and notebooks were originally developed in winter / spring 2014
in support of an undergraduate course at the University at Albany.
See the original course webpage at
http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV480_Spring2014/

The package and its API was completely redesigned around a truly object-oriented 
modeling framework in January 2015.

It will be used extensively for a graduate-level climate modeling course in Spring 2015:
