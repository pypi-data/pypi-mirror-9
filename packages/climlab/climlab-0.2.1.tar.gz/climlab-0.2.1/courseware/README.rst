About
----------------

This is a collection of ``IPython`` notebooks used for teaching
some basics of climate science, and documenting use of the 
``climlab`` Python package.

These should all run out-of-the-box once ``climlab`` is installed, e.g:

``ipython notebook Insolation.ipynb``

will open the notebook in a browser.
