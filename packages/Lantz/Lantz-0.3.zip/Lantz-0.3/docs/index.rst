Lantz is an automation and instrumentation toolkit with a clean, well-designed
and consistent interface. It provides a core of commonly used functionalities
for building applications that communicate with scientific instruments allowing
rapid application prototyping, development and testing. Lantz benefits from
Python's extensive library flexibility as a glue language to wrap existing
drivers and DLLs.

When you use Lantz you get:

    - A comprehensive and growing library of curated and well documented
      instruments drivers.

    - A really easy way write your own drivers. In less than an hour
      you can write a full driver with bounds checks, useful logging,
      async capabilities and much more.

    - On-the-fly GUI for testing purposes.
      Without a line of code you get for **any** driver something like this

    - Tools to quickly build beautiful, responsive and composable applications.

    - Rapid application development primitives.

    - An awesome and supporting community.
