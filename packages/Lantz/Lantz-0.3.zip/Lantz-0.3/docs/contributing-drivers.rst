Contributing Drivers
====================

The most straightforward way to contribute to Lantz is by submitting instrument
drivers as you do not need to understand the whole structure of `Lantz`.

There are two ways:

- Clone the repo in github and do a pull request
- Upload your code to a gist_,

Please be sure that you have documented the code properly before submission. You
can also use this tool if you want some feedback about your code.
