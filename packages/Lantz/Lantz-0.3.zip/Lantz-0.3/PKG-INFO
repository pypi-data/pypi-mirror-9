        =====
        
        Lantz is an automation and instrumentation toolkit with a clean, well-designed and consistent interface. It provides a core of commonly used functionalities for building applications that communicate with scientific instruments allowing rapid application prototyping, development and testing. Lantz benefits from Python's extensive library flexibility as a glue language to wrap existing drivers and DLLs.
        
        Lantz aim to provide a library of curated and well documented instruments drivers. We have some already, let us know if you cannot find yours.
