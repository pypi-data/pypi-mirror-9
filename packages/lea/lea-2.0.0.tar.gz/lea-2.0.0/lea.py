    '''
    Lea is an abstract class representing discrete probability distributions.

    Each instance of concrete Lea subclasses (called simply a "Lea instance" in the following)
    represents a discrete probability distribution, which associates each value of a set of
    values with the probability that such value occurs.

    A Lea instance can be defined by a sequence of (value,weight), giving the probability weight 
    of each value. Such probability weights are natural numbers. The actual probability of a
    given value can be calculated by dividing a weight by the sum of all weights. 
     
    A Lea instance can be defined also by a sequence of values, their probability weight being 
    their number of occurences in the sequence.

    Lea instances can be combined in arithmetic expressions resulting in new Lea instances, by
    obeying the following rules:

    - Lea instances can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided together,
    through +, -, *, / operators. The resulting distribution's values and probabilities
    are determined by combination of operand's values with a sum weighted by probability
    products (the operation known as 'convolution', for the adition case).

    - Other supported binary arithmetic operators are power (**), modulo (%) and
    divmod function.

    - Unary operators +, - and abs function are supported also.

    - The Python's operator precedence rules, with the parenthesis overrules, are fully
    respected.

    - Any object X, which is not a Lea instance, involved as argument of an
    expression containing a Lea instance, is coerced to a Lea instance
    having X has sole value, with probability 1 (i.e. occurrence of X is certain).

    - Lea instances can be compared together, through ==, !=, <, <=, >, >= operators.
    The resulting distribution is a boolean distribution, giving probability of True result
    and complementary probability of False result.

    - Boolean distributions can be combined together with AND, OR, XOR, through &, |, ^
    operators, respectively.

    - WARNING: the Python's and, or, not, operators shall not be used because they do not return
    any sensible result. Replace:
           a and b    by    a & b
           a or b     by    a | b
           not a      by    ~ a

    - WARNING: in boolean expression involving arithmetic comparisons, the parenthesis
    shall be used, e.g. (a < b) & (b < c)

    - WARNING: the augmented comparison (a < b < c) expression shall not be used.; it does
    not return any sensible result (reason: it has the same limtation as 'and' operator).

    Lea instances can be used to generate random values, respecting the given probabilities.
            
    There are ten concrete subclasses to Lea, namely: Alea, Clea, Plea, Flea, Tlea, Ilea, Olea,
     Dlea, Mlea, Rlea and Blea.
    
    Each subccass represents a special kind of discrete probability distribution, with its own data
    or with references to other Lea instances to be combined together through a given operation.
    Each subclass defines what are the (value,probability) pairs or how they can be generated (see
    _genVPs method implemented in each Lea subclass, which is called by Lea.genVPs method). 
    The Lea class acts as a facade, by providing different methods to instantiate these subclasses,
    so it is usually not needed to instantiate them explicitely. 
    
    Here is an overview on these subclasses, with their relationships.

    - An Alea instance is defined by explicit value-probability pairs. Each probability is
    defined as a positive "counter" integer, without upper limit. The actual
    probability is calculated by dividing the counter by the sum of all counters.

    Instances of other Lea subclasses represent probability distributions obtained by
    operations done on existing Lea instance(s), assuming that represented events are independent.
    Any instance of such subclasses forms a tree structure, having other Lea instances as nodes
    and Alea instances as leaves. These use lazy evaluation: actual value-probability pairs are
    calculated only at the time they are required (e.g. display); then, these are cached in an
    Alea instance, itself attribute of the Lea instance, to speed up next accesses.
    
    Here is a brief presentation of these subclasses: 

    - the Clea subclass provides the cartesian product of a given sequence of Lea instances;
    - the Plea subclass provides the cartesian product of one Lea instance with itself, a given number of times;
    - the Flea subclass applies a given function to a given sequence of Lea instances;
    - the Tlea subclass applies a given 2-ary function, a given number of times, on a given Lea instance;
    - the Ilea subclass filters the values of a given Lea instance by applying a given boolean condition;
    - the Olea subclass builds a joint probability distribution from a Lea instance with tuples as values;
    - the Dlea subclass performs a given number of draws without replacement on a given Lea instance.
    - the Mlea subclass merges several Lea instances together
    - The Rlea subclass manages Lea instances containing other Lea instances as values
    - The Blea subclass defines CPT providing Lea instances corresponding to given conditions
