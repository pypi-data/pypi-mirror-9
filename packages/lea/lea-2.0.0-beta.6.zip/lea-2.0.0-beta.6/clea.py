    Clea is a Lea subclass, which instance is defined by a given sequence (L1,...Ln)
    of Lea instances; it represents a probability distribution made up from the
    cartesian product L1 x ... x Ln; assuming independency of events, it associates
    each (v1,...,vn) tuple with probability product P1(v1)...Pn(vn).
