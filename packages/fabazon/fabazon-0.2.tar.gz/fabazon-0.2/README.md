fabazon - Fabric utilities for Amazon Web Services
==================================================

fabazon adds some conveniences for working with Amazon Web Services from
within [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/). It's designed to allow for
easy uploading to S3, downloading signed URLs from S3, interacting with
ELB, and more.

It's pretty young and should not be considered API-stable.
