    """Start a custom business transaction.

    There may be only one active BT per thread.  Attempts to start subsequent BTs
    in the same thread will return a ``bt_handle`` of ``None``.

    Consider using the ``bt`` context manager instead in cases where you start
    and end the BT in the same code (i.e., where you can wrap the whole BT in
    a ``with`` statement).

    Examples
    --------
    Given the code:

        setup()
        do_work()
        teardown()

    If you want to report `do_work` as a business transaction, you can either
    use ``start_bt`` and ``end_bt`` like so:

        from appdynamics.agent import api as appd
        setup()

        bt_handle = appd.start_bt('do work')
        try:

        except Exception as exc:
            raise
        finally:
            appd.end_bt(bt_handle, exc)

    Or you can use the ``bt`` context manager:

        setup()

        with bt('do work'):
            do_work()

        teardown()

    The latter is preferable, but only available when the BT starts and ends
    in the same context.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The name to give the BT in the controller.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    correlation_header : str, optional
        If specified, a correlation header that has been generated by another
        AppDynamics agent and passed to this agent as a str.

    Returns
    -------
    BtHandle
        A handle that identifies this BT or, if no BT was started, None.

    See Also
    --------
    end_bt : End a BT.
    bt : A context manager that starts and ends a BT around your code. This is
         often easier than using ``start_bt`` and ``end_bt`` manually.

    There may be only one active exit call per BT.  Attempts to start subsequent exit calls will

    Examples
    --------
    Given code that originally looks like this:

        try:
            db = custom_db.connect(host='financials-lb', port=3456)
            all_employees = db.query_path('/financials/employees')

            salaries_by_dept = individual_contributors.sum(value='salary', group='dept', as='total')

            for dept, total in salaries_by_dept.extract('dept', 'total'):
                report_salary_data(dept, total)

    You can wrap it in a business transaction and report a custom exit call
    by changing the code to:

        from appdynamics.agent import api as appd
        appd.init()

        FINANCIALS_ID_PROPS = {'Host': 'financials-lb', 'Port': 3456, 'Vendor': 'CUSTOM DB'}

        with appd.bt('department rollup') as bt_handle:
            exit_call = appd.start_exit_call(bt_handle, appd.EXIT_DB, 'Financials Database', FINANCIALS_ID_PROPS)
            exc = None

            try:
                db = custom_db.connect(host='financials-lb', port=3456)
                all_employees = db.query_path('/financials/employees')
                individual_contributors = all_employees.filter(lambda r: r.level < 3)
                salaries_by_dept = individual_contributors.sum(value='salary', group='dept', as='total')

                for dept, total in salaries_by_dept.extract('dept', 'total'):
                    report_salary_data(dept, total)
            except Exception as exc:
                raise  # Assuming something above handles exceptions for you
            finally:
                end_exit_call(exit_call, exc)

    Alternatively, in cases like the above, you can use the ``exit_call``
    decorator to simplify the code:

        from appdynamics.agent import api as appd
        appd.init()

        FINANCIALS_ID_PROPS = {'Host': 'financials-lb', 'Port': 3456, 'Vendor': 'custom db'}

        with appd.bt('department rollup') as bt_handle:
            with appd.exit_call(bt_handle, appd.EXIT_DB, 'Financials Database', FINANCIALS_ID_PROPS):
                db = custom_db.connect(host='financials-lb', port=3456)
                all_employees = db.query_path('/financials/employees')
                individual_contributors = all_employees.filter(lambda r: r.level < 3)
                salaries_by_dept = individual_contributors.sum(value='salary', group='dept', as='total')

                for dept, total in salaries_by_dept.extract('dept', 'total'):
                    report_salary_data(dept, total)

    Parameters
    ----------
    bt_handle : BtHandle
        A handle for a business transaction
    exit_type : int
    display_name : str
        The first time an exit call with the given identifying properties is
        made, its display name in the controller will be set to whatever you
        pass here. This shows up in the UI as the label on the flow map.
    identifying_properties : dict
        Identifying properties are a set of name-value string pairs (a dict)
        that uniquely identify the downstream component. For example, for a
        database, the identifying properties might be the vendor of the
        database (e.g., "SQL Server"), the host name and port, and the
        name of the database. The key of the dict is the name of the
        property; the value is the value of the property.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    operation : str, optional
        A string describing the operation that is being performed, such as
        the URL of an HTTP request or a SQL query for a DB.
    optional_properties : dict, optional
        If specified, a dictionary of optional properties that will be shown
        in the controller UI for this exit call.

    Returns
    -------
    ExitCallHandle
        A handle that identifies this exit call, for passing to
        ``end_exit_call`` or ``make_correlation_header``.

    See Also
    --------
    end_exit_call : Must be called to end the exit call. If any exit calls
                    aren't ended when the BT is ended, then they are all
                    ended when the BT is ended.

                and ``end_exit_call`` around your code.
